Oh, it looks like I lost...\nSure was fun, though! Thanks!\c
Ah ha ha! I keep on smiling, even if I lose.\nThat's my policy!\c
Alas, it is I whose luck ran out...\c
Well, what do you think?\nDo I look a little bit slimmer now?\c
Oh, my poor little ones!\nAre you OK? I'll keep you safe!\c
Wow, you're strong...\nYou're free to go on ahead now.\c
Aww...\nYou beat me...\c\nBut I'm not going to give up!\nI'm going back to the bakery.\c
I shouldn't have gobbled pastries before\na battle. Fruit would be a better choice...\c
Well, you sure are a kid who\nisn't to be underestimated!\c
Hmm...this place might be\ntoo dangerous for the kids.\c
Not bad!\nBut you won't get the best of me next time!\c
An impressive display of fighting spirit!\c
Yeow! I think I pulled a muscle\nwhen I threw that Poké Ball!\c
I lost... Heh-heh.\nYou were wonderful!\c
You're strong! Thanks for the battle.\nIt was great training!\c
That was a peaceful battle!\nHeh-heh. Let's shake hands!\c
I apologize for my rudeness.\nPlease, continue on your way.\c
Ha ha ha! Looks like I lost!\nI'll be back after I polish my bald spot!\c
For a sec, I thought you were a bit shady,\nbut you beat me fair and square!\c
This is just the beginning of your journey!\nAim for the bottom level, and get stronger!\c
Argh! Looks like I need\nto start over from base camp!\c
You're good!\nGood luck on your journey in here!\c
Nice! Use that momentum\nto climb even higher!\c
Nooo! How will I impress my daughter now?\c
Take that strength and use it\nto defeat your rivals!\c
Argh... You're not bad.\nYou'd better make it to the bottom!\c
You're a scrappy one! You'd make\na good Janitor, you know?\c
You won because I was distracted by\ndental difficulties.\c
Awesome and furious! There's\nno way I could have beaten you!\c
One little loss isn't enough to make\nme give up! I'm just getting started!\c
I'm not the chosen one?\nHow can this be?\c
Incredible.\nYou were stronger than I imagined.\c
I knew I would lose! It was foreseen!\nBut still it is my destiny to battle!\c
Ahh! Such strength, such spirit...\nIt lifts my heart!\c
You won't beat me next time!\nI'm going to reach the top first!\c
We lost, but my Pokémon are telling me\nthey enjoyed battling you.\c
I'll use this data to become even stronger!\c
I can't believe it... What went wrong\nwith my calculations?\c
Ho-ho...looks like I'd better\nstick to what I know best!\c
Nice battle! You passed the test!\nYou're free to go up.\c
That was a nice break! Thanks!\nI'd better go do my homework now.\c
I'm terrible with directions...\nThis labyrinth may be too much for me!\c
I came up with that battle strategy\nin class. I can't believe it didn't work!\c
Oi! You'll see!\nI'll show them all that I'm a proper lady!\c
I lost...\nI just need to try harder next time.\c
Whoa! You're so strong!\nThanks for the fun! I feel refreshed!\c
Thank you! I look forward\nto our next battle.\c
Oh no...\nIt looks like I'm the one who got served!\c
Did our battle suit your tastes?\c
Wow! You were great!\nSuch an impressive battle!\c
Whoa-ho! You're no joke!\nYou can run things around here now.\c
I'm going to keep on battling\nand chasing my own dream!\c
Well, that wasn't cool...\nPlease don't tell the others, OK?\c
You're good! Your Pokémon are\npretty cute, too!\c
The road to becoming an Idol Trainer\nis long and full of trials!\c
You're the strongest Trainer\nI've encountered here yet!\c
It's just like I read in the guidebook!\nThis is a tough place.\c
Are there more strong Trainers like you?\nThis is going to be fun!\c
That was a good change of pace!\nI'd better get back to exploring!\c
Incredible! This may be the first time\nI've run into someone like you!\c
Your attacks are too powerful!\nI'm sorry! Please forgive me!\c
Hmph. I guess talent is pretty\nimportant, too...\c
Wow! I lost!\nGo on ahead!\c
My loss! You're good! I'd better get some\ngrocery shopping done before I go home.\c
Hmm... Looks like I'm still not good enough.\nI need to train harder!\c
Oh...\nNo more sneaking up on people!\c
I'm better at kneading dough and\nbaking bread than I am at battling...\c
I guess my power lunch wasn't enough\nto help me beat you. But it was delicious!\c
Aww... I lost!\nI worked so hard to raise them, too!\c
Oh...\nWhere did everybody go?\c
Whoa... What happened?\nI'm spent...\c
Argh! At this rate I'll never be like\nthe Black Belt of legend!\c
Aaaarghhh!\nI'm better at shouting than at winning!\c
My moves were no good!\nArgh! I guess I need to practice more.\c
Oh no! I lost!\nI was born under the star of defeat!\c
So tired...\nI'm gonna go take a little break!\c
I... I'm sorry!\nI'll be careful where I walk from now on!\c
I lost! Hah!\nWell, there's my good deed for the day.\c
Resisting arrest! Obstruction of justice!\nYou're not allowed to beat me, civilian!\c
That was a fair and clean battle! You must\nnot be one of the bad guys I'm looking for.\c
Be prepared, and you don't have to worry!\nThe same goes for mountain climbing!\c
Argh... Maybe you've got the right idea,\npacking light. I can barely move!\c
I'm done exploring for the day.\nI think I'll retire to my tent for now!\c
Ugh! My sweat and tears weren't\nnearly enough!\c
You won that one. You probably don't need\nto worry about staying where it's safe!\c
I lost...\c
You got them all scuffed up!\nWhat do you think you're doing?\c
What you see is not my true identity.\n...An old man who can't find a steady job.\c
Nice job!\nSafe travels and good luck!\c
I lost! I hope I can make my Pokémon\nstronger before my vacation is over!\c
Why am I getting so excited?\nWhat is this place?\c
Psychic powers, go! Ahhh...\nWhat a relief. Now I won't be sore!\c
I lost... Can it be?\nI guess not everyone in here is a weakling.\c
I had a dream that we would battle.\nBut I forgot who'd win. Guess now I know!\c
Phew...\nLooks like I need to take things slower.\c
Oh, wow!\nThat wasn't even a challenge for you.\c
No prize money for me... Maybe someday\nI can stop worrying about paying the bills.\c
No! This can't be! This must be a mistake!\nThis result is not scientific!\c
Ah! This battle inspired me! I think\nI may have a breakthrough on my hands!\c
Hmm...these numbers are unexpected.\nI may still need more data.\c
I lost? Looks like I didn't study enough!\c
Oww! I'd better stop messing around here\nand get back to my studies...\c
I believe I have lost my beloved dignity.\c
Ugh! It's not fair! I wish I could have won\nmy last battle of the day...\c
Ack... To have beaten me like that,\nyou're quite the genius yourself!\c
I want to go up higher...\nI'm sick of this area!\c
Was our battle to your liking?\c
I'm glad I caught you in time!\nPlease don't forget our battle.\c
You've still got a long way to go! Please,\ntake a break and drink some water first.\c
Eek! I'm sorry! I'll be serious about my\njob from now on!\c
Urgh! I've gotta go!\c
I lost!\nLooks like we still need to get stronger!\c
It doesn't matter what I do.\nI don't have your crazy power level.\c
We have to deal with things--sometimes even\nthings we don't deserve. Like this defeat!\c
Round and round I go in this maze.\nI'm starting to get dizzy!\c
We had a great time!\nPlay with us again soon!\c
There's no indecision in your battle style!\nYou must know exactly where you're going!\c
Hmm...was that really my true battle style?\c
I have highly honed senses, especially smell!\nCan you smell defeat?\c
Ohh! I lost! I'll never save up enough\nto travel the world like this.\c
Even if I lose, I'm still happy that I can\nbe with my Pokémon!\c
The power of youth...\nI just can't win!\c
Great! Take that momentum and go\nstraight to the end!\c
You must have a good training technique!\nKeep it up and you'll go far!\c
Oh, what lovely Pokémon you have!\nLet me pet their heads!\c
With strenuous battles like that,\nthe pounds just melt away!\c
Do you smell something burning?\nMaybe it's just my pride...\c
Come visit my bakery once it's open!\c
I need to get a little bit stronger\nif I want to keep up with everybody!\c
Ugh, that was too much...\nI'm all burned out now.\c
In order to protect the ones who matter\nto me, I need to get stronger!\c
Hah... Someday I hope I can make it\nall the way to the bottom.\c
I lost! Maybe power isn't everything...\nWhat else is there? Maybe speed?\c
I can't believe you beat me!\nThat trick always works...\c
I lost! So much for winning 100\nbattles in a row!\c
Please, don't feel sorry for someone\nwho lost so miserably!\c
Man... I'm thinking this whole Roughneck\nthing might not be for me...\c
Oh, man. You sure showed us! Maybe it's\ntime to give up this bad-guy routine!\c
If you're going to keep battling in here,\nat least be civil out in the forest!\c
Hmm... Everything checks out.\nYou're free to go.\c
Heh! There's still no way you'll make it\nall the way to the bottom!\c
It is you whose splendor is like that\nof a mountain!\c
Oh well, my loss!\nI'd better go find the rest of my team...\c
Gah! The strong will at work here\nappears to have chosen you!\c
You must be a pro Trainer!\nSorry for underestimating you!\c
These are just regular plants around here.\nNot worth getting heated up about.\c
That was supposed to be my prize money!\nDon't spend it all in one place!\c
I'm not as down from this loss as I am from\nall the Trainers littering here lately.\c
You followed a good, safe strategy.\nThat's the best way! Be careful as you go!\c
What are the managers thinking,\nmaking us battle like this?\c
There are Trainers like you in here, too?\nLooks like I still need to get stronger.\c
I was using my telepathy to convince you\nthat I'd win... What a letdown.\c
It's just as I foresaw!\nYou are a strong Trainer!\c
I can't even beat you! There's no way\nI'd make it in the upper areas.\c
Smiles are most definitely a kind of\npsychic power! Don't forget it!\c
Now you've got me all bent out of shape!\nI'd better go home and calm down.\c
OK! I'd better get started on preparing\na report of our battle!\c
Defeated... Now my research will never\nreceive the recognition it deserves!\c
Defeat smells as sour as a conspiracy!\c
Now I'm more interested in how you\ngot so strong!\c
I'm not aiming for the top!\nMy way of life is OK, too.\c
Maybe I'd be better off just studying\nfor my entrance exams...\c
I guess this is the end for me!\nNot bad, if I do say so myself.\c
Ohh... I've still got a long way to go\nif I want to be like my sister...\c
Aww... OK, you win...\nYou can use my floor.\c
My legs are strong from skipping. I never\nskip training! But you still schooled me.\c
Excellent!\nPlease, continue on your way!\c
I want to be a Trainer who excels in battles\nand a Waiter who excels in service!\c
I've been looking for my little sister for a\nlong time. I'll look for as long as it takes!\c
It's important to remember to have fun!\nLet's play catch!\c
I want to explore the wonders of space. I\nwonder who'll be first to see those wonders!\c
Yahoo! What a blast! I love\nbattling in here!\c
It's still not enough!\nI need to bring even stronger Pokémon!\c
I just want some new clothes\nso I can look nice!\c
I lost! But I know how to say\nwhat I need to say!\c
I won't let this little loss get me down!\nI'm going to rise to the heights like a kite!\c
Hey, you got some prize money!\nReally, though, where does it come from?\c
I lost, but I don't mind.\nIt's the carefree life for me!\c
I lost this time, but I'm not worried.\nI've just got to take my time!
Wow, you've got some cool Pokémon!\nI didn't stand a chance!\c
Argh! I'm sorry.\nCan I ever be forgiven for this?\c
How could I have lost? Maybe items aren't\nthe only important thing in a battle...\c
Good! Keep that guard up and\nyou'll do fine!\c
Argh! My rage was too tasty!\c
The more they battle, the stronger\nthey get!\c
I hope I can take them to the hot springs\nsoon. They desperately need some R&R!\c
Oh no! I lost! I hope you put that prize\nmoney toward realizing your dreams!\c
Bread or rice?\nThat is the question...\c
Aww...\nI've been called a Slowpoke, but I'm not!\c
How? My techniques were good enough\nto quiet even the worst tantrum!\c
Yes! I can only truly be myself\nwhen I'm battling!\c
Looks like I'll be in here for a while...\nI sure do miss the sun!\c
You...you're stronger than me!\nIs this reality?\c
Woo! Incredible!\nThanks for the battle, new rival!\c
You're good! You must be\nassistant-instructor tier!\c
I used to cry whenever I lost.\nBut not anymore! I've changed!\c
My bros won't let you get away\nwith this!\c
Urgh! Bros! Where are you?\nHelp me out here!\c
I don't have to tell you\nwho really makes the rules...\c
You won! OK, I'll give you my best hint!\c
Mmm...mmm! I love my leafy greens!\nI wish I were a Grass-type Pokémon!\c
The more I investigate, the deeper\nthe mystery seems to get.\c
Heh-heh... Maybe I should quit being a\nHiker and become a spelunker!\c
I wonder if the ancient underground people\nhad Pokémon battles like this?\c
I just lose track of time whenever\nI'm down here...
Remember, I just feel like a Boss Trainer!\nYou still have to beat the real one!\c
I get a strange sense of safety inside this\ngiant white tree...even if I lose the battle!\c
Knock me down and I get back up!\nPunk is all about having spirit!\c
Still not strong enough...\nThey won't be satisfied...\c
You're good!\nThe boss is gonna have fun with you!\c
Argh! That was so uncool...\c
Gah! OK, I lost.\nYou're the one who survived!\c
I can feel a darkness from your\nbattle style, too!\c
What happened? Was it just my imagination?\nI thought I saw something...\c
Tsk! You'd better be thankful that\nI went easy on you!\c
I've got to get stronger so I can create\nmy rainbow building!\c
Incredible! You seem to have a knack\nfor increasing your power rating.\c
All right! Thanks for the help!\nIt's off to the beach with me!\c
Your attack patterns...\nYou're giving me some great examples!\c
Ahh...\nThis is it for me...\c
I guess I can't make you do my homework\nafter all. But I just don't waaaaanna...\c
It's important to shake hands after a loss\nto demonstrate how nice you are!\c
Oh no... My prize money...\nNeed...more...\c
I guess it was like playing house! ♪\nThanks for playing with me!\c
Oh! I'm doing a good job of saving up to buy\na Munna pillow. Nearly there!\c
Of course I'm going to battle!\nThis is the Black Tower, after all!\c
Tsk! Th-thanks so much for the battle...\c
Wow, you're strong!\nPlease, continue on your way!\c
I lost!\nGrrr... Stupid horoscope!\c
I tripped and fell down, and my Poké Balls\nwent everywhere! Heh heh! ♪\c
Why... My mentor told me I'd never lose\nwith these strategies...\c
Ugh... I can't go on...\nWhere did my determination go?\c
You're good!\nWant to help me take over the world?\c
Ohh... I want to visit the stars soon!\c
I won't let this loss get me down!\nI've got to keep battling for my family!\c
I LOSE...SAD-NESS...\nAm I taking my robot impression too far?\c
I shouldn't have let mentor talk\ngo to my head... I feel bad now...\c
I've been in this area for more than half a\nyear now! Maybe I'm just no good...\c
Yup! I think I'll go train in the lower\nareas some more.
Don't think that just because you beat me\nyou can take on the Trainers up ahead!\c
You may have beaten me, but you still have\nto face even stronger Pokéfans up ahead!\c
Wow, you beat me soundly!\c\nBut you've still got a long way to go\nbefore you can call yourself the strongest!\c
Determination... Looks like you've got it!\nGood luck!\c
Looks like you have strong bonds with your\nPokémon! Keep it up and you'll go far!\c
Maybe I should go home to my husband.\c
That was some good exercise! My\nrambunctious Pokémon are pleased!\c
No time to feel bad about losing!\nI'll beat the next opponent for sure!\c
Yeah, you'll be OK!\nCharge on ahead!\c
OK! That's enough for me!\nI'd better get back to the preschool!\c
Oh, wow...\nYou're a really serious person!\c
This place is still too tough! Guess I need\nto find somewhere even easier...\c
As long as we keep focusing on becoming\nstronger, we'll beat you someday!\c
Argh!\nTalk about kicking a guy when he's down...\c
Wow! You saw through their every move!\nThere's always someone better, they say!\c
You won't make it down below if you don't\nget stronger!\c
I guess it was just my imagination. I really\nthought I'd achieved enlightenment, too...\c
I'm so sorry...\nPlease, continue on your way...\c
Hmph! I guess you need to have stronger\nPokémon to get prize money around here!\c
Maybe you'll be OK if you've got Pokémon\nlike those to depend on!\c
That was fun! Follow the slogan for\nfun battles!\c
You've still got a long road ahead of you!\nDon't give up!\c
An excellent greeting!\nGood luck up ahead!\c
Isn't it great? Come on, you Pokémon!\nBreathe with me!\c
You beat me!\nAmazing progress!\c
Argh! I just can't get away from\nthe trampling Trainers!\c
I lost! Maybe I should have spent\nmore time on the prologue to this...\c
Meeting new people is one of the best\nparts of volunteering!\c
I hope that Trainers can enjoy battles\nin here even a hundred years from now!\c
I'm a mercenary Trainer. As long as I have\nenough battles in a day, I get paid.\c
Someone with your strength should be able\nto have fun battling just about anywhere!\c
Losing is nothing to be afraid of!\nJust keep battling and never run away!\c
You may be strong, but you still wouldn't\nbe a match for that Trainer who beat me...\c
I'm spent...\nYou win.\c
Ack! With moves like those, there's no way\nI can maintain my focus!\c
How dare you get in the way of the dreams\nof a pure-hearted girl like me?\c
Argh! It was just as I thought.\nYou are a bit strong!\c
I lost! Why would I want to install a\nsurveillance camera here?\c\nI'm not even sure myself...\c
Ah... You're quite an interesting\nspecimen, too!\c
I plan to jump up and down in the elevator\non my way out of here!\c
Oh! I got some good data!\nThis place is a researcher's paradise!\c
My dad taught me to try to intimidate people\nlike this, but it didn't work on you!\c
A weak Trainer like me won't\nstand a chance up ahead!\c
Wow, you're a really skilled Trainer, too!\c
Maybe you're the kind of Trainer\nmy dad is searching for!\c
I lost!\nOh well! Our battle was fun!\c
You blew us away like so many flower\npetals on the wind...\c
I apologize! Someone like you will be\njust fine!\c
How was the special menu?\nWe await your next visit!\c
You won't take it easy on me, either?\nYou're all such barbarians!\c
Nice! Your Pokémon are very\ncharming, too!\c
Ohh...\nThe road to popularity sure is steep...\c
Sorry! I'm just at the age where everyone\nlooks like a bad guy!\c
Tsk! I'd better find my friend and have him\ntrade me some stronger Pokémon!\c
See! It only stands to reason!\nI knew I'd lose to you.
I wonder if the Pokémon in the upper areas\nare as dangerous as yours?\c
Grrr! So many new things I want to buy, but\nI don't have any money!\c
That was good! I have no regrets now!\nBe careful up there!\c
I'll just stand back up if I get knocked\ndown! I'll never give up!\c
Marriage is so boring compared to a life of\nadventuring and Pokémon battles!\c
Just how high up does this building go?\c
Yikes! What is with this place?!\nIt's like I stepped into another dimension!\c
Ugh... I guess that didn't work...\c
So this is my limit...\nI'll push beyond it someday!\c
Maybe this is it for me... I don't think\nI can go any further.\c
You beat everyone's Pokémon... How could\nthat have happened? Who are you?\c
Wow, your Pokémon are\neven crazier than mine!\c
Ohh... I guess the bigger the prize,\nthe harder the battles are, too.\c
Your battle style has such a savory aroma!\c
Nice! Don't give up even if you're\nburned and blackened!\c
We may have lost today, but\nwe'll get you next time for sure!\c
What powerful attacks!\nOh, man! This is exciting!\c
No! I'm still too weak to challenge\nthe Black Belt of legend!\c
Allow me to welcome you, strong one.\nYou are meant to be here!\c
I never should have underestimated an\nopponent. Looks like I was the weak one!\c
Hmph! Looks like you're good enough\nto challenge the boss!\c
I need to figure out how to stop losing...\nNo one must beat me...\c
As you can see, I'm different from the\nothers... I'm nowhere near as strong!\c
Yeah, I know, I know.\nI'm no good all alone.\c
Ahh, I see. It's Trainers like you that\nmake the rules around here.\c
Maybe beating you wasn't so simple\nafter all...\c
I lost and now the voices of tree spirits\nI heard are gone!\c\nCould it have been my imagination?!\c
Sometimes you may trip and fall, but just\nget back on the path!\c
Phew! I lost this battle, and now I'm going\nto take a breather.\c
Good luck as you keep going lower!\c
Who do they think they are? All of us on the\nexpedition are fans of Pokémon!\c
See?\nI knew I wouldn't win!\c
I may be experienced, but I just can't\ncompete with the power of youth!\c
Cleaning complete!\nCheck out the shine on your Pokémon!\c
What a great battle!\nWho needs money?\c
You do have talent! But you also have room\nfor improvement! How exciting!\c
Argh... I just know they're watching this\nbattle and laughing at me!\c
Whoosh! This place is terrifying!\c
What? How could I slip up here?!\c
Now that's what I'm talking about! I came\nhere to battle strong Trainers like you!\c
Maybe it's not all about power! I could see\nyour love for your Pokémon!\c
What a courageous Trainer! I can sense\nyour strong determination!\c
I see... It's gifted ones like you\nthat make it to the end.\c
More! We've got to battle harder!\nWe can create a powerful explosion!\c
Don't let your guard down!\nThere are some scary Trainers up ahead!\c
Time to research this battle data and find\nout why I lost! Then I'll become stronger!\c
Hey! If you're strong, then could you try\nto at least look the part?\c
I can't draw enough ecopower from\nBlack City... There are too many buildings!\c
Hmm... Maybe your streak will go on\nfor a bit longer...\c
What? I lost?!\nAnd so easily at that...\c
How could this be?!\nArgh! My prize money!\c
I've always dreamed of having ferocious\nbattles like this! So much fun!\c
No wonder the boss is a fan...\nI hope you make it far!\c
There are many more powerful opponents\nahead. Please, keep your guard up!\c
I hope you can survive up ahead!\c
Ohh... I just want to take things easy and\nenjoy my battles...\c
We lost!\nYou've got some strong Pokémon!\c
You've got the aura of a star around you...\c
I'm not one of the Elite Four...\c\nI just think of myself as one to be\nmore confident.\c
I just know someone's watching our battles!\nGrrr! Who could it be?\c
Incredible! You'll go far with strength\nlike that!\c
You're being so nice!\nCome on! You can laugh at me!\c
Wow. With strength like that, you should\nbe able to go up even higher...\c
No! Your strength is the true justice here!\nKeep going and don't look back!\c
Ahh! I lost!\nYou're as strong as I sensed you were!\c
We've still got a long way to go! But now\nI'm motivated! Let's give it our all!\c
It wasn't enough! I need to become\neven more dangerous! Crazy dangerous!\c
Your Pokémon are something else! They could\neven place in the top 10!\c
Phew... Battling against a strong opponent\nreally gets the heart beating!\c
I am one with my Pokémon!\nWe will share the frustration of this loss.\c
You defeated my secret weapon!\nI don't have a chance against you!\c
I may have lost, but my fellow Pokéfans\nwill avenge me!\c
I'll never give up until I have enough\nto open my own bakery!\c
It doesn't matter if I lose! I just need a\nquick snack, and I'll be better in no time!\c
That's right! We're Trainers!\nThis is all we have to do!\c
I've got goose bumps now!\nHee hee! Let's battle again sometime!\c
You don't give your opponents any room\nfor error! How impressive!\c
That's some strength you have...\nWhat determination...\c
What brave Pokémon you have!\nThey won't cower in fear!\c
The weak lose and the strong win!\nThat's all you need to know about strength!\c
Ahh! I thought I had you!\nI just need to focus more...\c
You...\nI'll beat you someday!\c
Argh! You beat me!\nSo much for my ambitions...\c
I'm so sorry!\nPlease forgive me...\c
Thanks! I feel a lot better now!\nI'd better get back to my rounds.\c
Go on! The boss is looking for strong\nTrainers like you!\c
Ugh... I lost!\nMaybe I'll go back up to the surface and\r\ntake a quick nap!\c
Ahh... That's a strange-looking mushroom\nover there...\c\nNo, I'm not hungry enough to risk it!\c
You've still got a long way to go,\nbut good luck!\c
This expedition isn't going anywhere, so I\njust made up a story in my head.\c
Maybe I should go back home for a while...\nI want to give my daughter a hug.\c
Amazing! You're as good as everyone says!\c
Looks like I'm not as strong as you!\nI need to keep training!\c
Ouch ouch ouch...\nI think my back gave out on me...\c
I won't take responsibility for whatever\nhappens to you up ahead...\c
Your strength still isn't enough! The\nhigher-ups demand an even stronger Trainer!\c
Gah! My dreams of becoming popular\nseem to get farther away by the moment!\c
We're just flowing in the stream of destiny!\nEverything we do is already decided!\c
So this is what it feels like to lose.\nHmph. I liked it better when I didn't know.\c
You must not lose yourself in battle...\nGood luck!\c
Even if I lose, I remain calm as long as I'm\nsurrounded by blue sky.\c
You seem pretty grounded.\nI like that!\c
My beloved family...\nAvenge me!\c
What an incredible reaction!\nHow far can it go?\c
If I'd known we were coming here,\nI would have brought stronger Pokémon!\c
What an exciting battle!\nI'm so glad I became a Trainer!\c
So, you had an ace up your sleeve!\nAll my efforts...wasted!\c
You're even stronger than my dad!\nTeach him a lesson if you run into him!\c
What kind of Pokémon have you got?!\nThey're way too strong! It's no fair!\c
Wow! It must be you!\nYou're so strong!\c
Everyone in here is looking to battle strong\nTrainers like you!\c
Keep going and don't look back!\nHappiness can be attained through battling!\c
I lost...\nGah! Amazing!\c
Was our battle just the way you like it?\c
Would you like to join the Boss Trainer\nfan club?\c
We are here to ensure high quality\nof service for our Pokémon battles!\c
Achoo!\nCan someone turn down the air conditioning?\c
Hey! Take it easy!\nShow some respect to your elders!\c
If I don't get better quickly, it's going\nto be a while before I make the front page!\c
You're strong! Hey, do me a favor! If you\nsee my dad, you should beat him, too!\c
You're stronger, so you're better!\nIt's that simple!\c
I won't say that I don't want to stop\nbattling and join my friends sometimes...\c
OK! I think I'll stay in Black City for\na while and get some training in!\c
When the areas get this big, it becomes\nhard to go back and find the elevator!\c
Outer space... I wonder if I'll\never make it to the top.\c
I can't believe it! I've never lost\nto anyone on my journey before!\c
What incredible Pokémon! They could be\non the same level as the Champion's!\c
Argh! What wild attacks!\nYou're pretty good, you know?\c
No way! We tried so hard, but we were\nstill defeated! How could this happen?\c
How incredible!\nNo wonder you're undefeated!\c
I couldn't defeat you, but my Pokémon\nare cheering me up!\c
The power of love didn't work against you!\nJust who are you, anyway?!\c
You're good! I bet you have really\nbig dreams of your own!\c
Oww!\nLooks like you baked me!\c
I won't forgive any Trainer who is\nstronger than me!\c
Tsk! I'm going back to the preschool\nso my kids can cheer me up...\c
You're strong! Someone as good as you may\nbe able to go head to head with him...\c
What?\nBut...but I'm a champion!\c
Hmm...\nSo that's how the battle was decided...\c
Your strength is becoming something of\na legend among the Trainers in here!\c
You're my newest rival!\nLet's get stronger together!\c
We lost, but you can keep your pity!\c
Ugh! I guess I have to admit\nyou're the real deal after all.\c
See? I can't become the boss like this.\nI haven't got a chance!\c
That's it! I throw my hands up...\nMaybe I should go put my feet up instead.\c
You're even stronger than they say!\nWe're not even in the same league!\c
Why don't you try shouting? It feels\ngood to shout at the top of your lungs!\c
Oh, you're not an ancient person?\nI thought I made a big discovery...\c
I've got an idea! You clear the way, and I'll\ncome down after you!\c
No wonder they can't stop talking\nabout you! Thanks for the battle!\c
How could you beat me?\nJust who are you?
Even still...\nThe expedition must go on!\c
Gah! There's nothing more frustrating\nthan losing to youngsters like you!\c
All right! Keep on battling until you\ncharge past the finish line!\c
Whoa! If you're that strong, you\nmight have a chance against him!\c
Wow! There aren't many like you... If you\nget even stronger, you might be able to...\c
I need to grow strong enough to defeat\nthis powerful energy...\c
Ugh! You got me!\nWhat perfect execution!\c
You appear to be on a higher level\nthan I am!\c
Sorry. I've calmed down now...\nWhat could be up there?\c
What incredible Pokémon!\nYou beat us soundly!\c
Hee hee! That battle was a sight\nto behold, indeed!\c
To have defeated my Pokémon so easily...\nHow incredible!\c
Argh...\nFine, whatever. Go on with your ruckus.\c
Wow, you're good! Keep up the\nincredible battles, please!\c
Hmph... You're no fun...\c
Looks like you've already gotten too\nbig for me...\c
Even by the standards of this place,\nyou're really good!\c
You looked absentminded, but you were\nreally thinking about your next strategy!\c
Everyone's hopes are on me!\nI can't give up yet!\c
I lost...\nYou might be even stronger than my dad!\c
I need more power! You will all obey me!\c
You're just as strong as they say!\nIt was an honor to battle against you!
Phew... It's no easy task to follow\nTrainers at your level!\c
I can't become the best like this...\nMaybe dreams really are just dreams...\c
As long as you do the best you possibly\ncan, everything will be OK!\c
I can't wait to explore the stars\nwith my Pokémon!\c
My little trick didn't work this time.\nMaybe I miscounted... Maybe you jinxed me!\c
Argh... Maybe I should start over again...\nThird time's the charm, right?\c
Waaah! I was wrong!\nThe correct answer is... Me!\c
If I don't get a move on, I'll be an old\nlady before my castle is built!\c
What? I lost?\nNooo! The prize money is getting away!\c
Days like this happen!\nBut I don't stop backpacking!\c
Ah hah hah hah!\nThat was great, rival!\c
This can't be my limit! I'll show everyone\nthat I can overcome it!\c
No time for breaks!\nCome on, let's run!\c
Wow! It looks like you think about your\nPokémon even in your sleep!\c
Ouch ouch... Hey, quit biting me!\nCome on, everyone! Let's go home!\c
Argh! It looks like you are just a little bit\nmore determined!\c
Looks like I couldn't stop you...\nI wonder how far you'll make it.\c
It's even harsher than I thought...\nBut I won't give up! I'll become a winner!\c
Oh... I didn't have to defeat you after all.\nThank you. That was very nice.\c
Grrr!\nI just need a little bit more!\c
Now we're friends, too!\nI won't forget about you!\c
You'll hit a wall one of these days.\nThink you'll be able to overcome it?\c
Argh! You must obey me!\nI'll never forgive you!\c
Gah! You defeated our secret technique\nso easily!\c
Muahaha! The pain of losing to you\nwill fuel my increasing strength!\c
You'd best prepare for the worst if you\nplan to go all the way to the bottom!\c
Our battle taught me a lot about you!\c
Hmm... I'm not sure I'm strong enough\nto hang out in this area.\c
Whoa! You countered my counter of your\ncounter to my counterattack! Amazing!\c
So this is what going out with a bang is like?\c
Ahh! What a great battle that was!\nGood-bye, Roughneck life!\c
So many complicated rules on\nthe surface! I just can't stand it!\c
You'll never master this place like this!\nYou need to get even stronger!\c
A loss is what it is!\nA mystery is what it is!\c
The White Treehollow...\nThis place is tougher than any mountain...\c
My loss to the boss... Err, sorry, sorry.\nI can't help but rap when I get excited!\c
How impressive! You'd better make it\nall the way to the bottom!\c
The truth is in here!\nI want to believe!\c
I'm here and enjoying myself with these\nbattles. Isn't that enough?\c
With a clean heart and strong Pokémon,\nyou're an incredible Trainer!\c
Go onward to the future!\nNever look back!\c
As a challenger, it doesn't matter how many\ntimes I lose! There's always a next time!\c
If you want to see below, go take a look\nfor yourself! You should be fine down there!\c
Gah... What is with everyone in here...\nYou all have such monstrous strength...\c
Very soon now... Soon we'll be released\nfrom the bonds of this planet...\c
What a beautiful defeat!\nMwahaha! We sure gave them a show!\c
Just who are you?!\nI've never been so humiliated...\c
I'll beat you next time! Then I'll celebrate\nwith a glorious feast!\c
How embarrassing...\nPlease, don't look at me...\c
Gah... We've still got a way to go!\nWe need more data!\c
Go! Keep on going! The vastness of\nouter space is right before you!\c
You might be able to compete on the galactic\nstage! Hurry and blast off!\c
Why do all of you strong Trainers refuse\nto share your secrets?\c
Wow! You're the one who is truly amazing!\nMind if I become your fan?\c
Chapter 1: Watch out for the Trainer\nwith the Bag...\c
Wha--? I lost already?\nI didn't even see what you did!\c
Wow, you're impressive!\nYou could be a great Teacher!\c
You beat my friend earlier...\nArgh... So frustrating...\c
I won't cry, either! When I conquer this\nplace, I'll laugh and cry at the same time!\c
From the first course to the last,\nyou defeated them all!\c
What an amazing spirit...and what amazing\nPokémon! Please, continue onward...\c
Is it because we're so high up?\nUgh...need more air...\c
That was a pretty incredible battle.\c
Wait... There's no air in outer space?\nI never knew that!\c
Grr... I swore on live TV that I'd\ndefeat you...\c
Losing once or twice won't shake the\nbelief I have in my partners!\c
I bet the lights of the buildings\nlook beautiful from above!\c
Even if all my fans forget about me, I hope\nI've given you a battle to remember...\c
Ah ha ha! Don't worry! I'm just making\nthis all up in my head!\c
Are you, by chance, always overcoming\nyour limits?\c
Ahh! I've come so close, but I just\ncan't reach the goal!\c
I lost...\nI want to see space someday...\c
I'll keep training to get stronger and\nwork my way to the top. Even if it's scary!\c
This long adventure is finally coming to a\nclose... A bit sad when I think about it.\c
How could you have become so strong?\c
I see... Somewhere along the way, it seems\nI've lost track of what's important...\c
I've never seen Pokémon like that before...\nThe world sure is a big place.
A world governed by love...\nWe won't give up on our dream so easily!\c
Looks like you're one of us!\c
Just keep it up, and you too can make your\ndreams come true!\c
Buns baked at the bottom are delicious!\nWon't you try one?\c
I'll beat you next time! I won't let\na new person like you show me up!\c
What? Just what was that?!\nNow I've lost all my confidence...\c
The battle...was fun...\nThen why am I crying?\c
I lost? How?\nJust who are you?\c
You are the new legend.\nSomeday, we shall battle again.\c
The more experienced one is you!\nI can tell by the way you battle.\c
Your Pokémon are impressive, but you're\neven more impressive!\c
Thanks for stopping me!\nI sometimes forget myself!\c
Ahh! Watch me! No one has ever made\nsuch a brilliant exit before!\c
Hmph! Looks like you and your Pokémon\nhave even stronger trust!\c
Your strength is true justice!\nThis area is just that kind of place.\c
It looks like even I am not up to the task of\ndefeating you. I wonder if anyone can...\c
Wha--? What happened?\nWhy are you looking at me like that?\c
There's no treasure, is there?\nI think I may have been hoodwinked!\c
Say hello if you run into me again!\c
What a strange place...\nSo intriguing...\c
I didn't lose!\nI'm not even me!\c
A first-class Trainer...\nYou'll be envied by all!\c
I've been alive for a very long time, but\nI've never encountered a Trainer like you.\c
You mean my daughter didn't put you up\nto this? I've run away from home...\c
I was looking for someone like you.\nYou might be able to make it to the end...\c
How is it? Makes even defeat smell good!\c
Your power is rooted deep down...\nIt's stronger than the power of space!\c
Argh! I won't lose! I'm better than this!\nI'm aiming for the top!\c
Ha ha! Someone is watching us and laughing\nright now!\c
The power...subsided?\nThanks! I owe you big-time!\c
Mmm-hmm! I gave it my all and lost, but that\nsure was fun and refreshing!\c
Now I join the ranks of the fallen...\nIt's all up to you now!\c
I love that you're lost! As the architect of\nthis place, that makes me very happy!\c
I need more data... No, that can't be it!\nI just can't process this battle!\c
How could I have lost?\nMaybe I can't surpass humanity?\c
Be my test subject...\nPlease...?\c
I'll defeat them all someday!\c\nThat's how I'll repay all of their kindness\nfor training with me!\c
As expected, I lost! That's it!\nI'm going back to the lower areas!\c
How could I lose? I came into this world\nscreaming two times two equals four!\c
I've never met anyone so strong! Things\nwill be more interesting with a rival like you!\c
You're fun to battle against!\nLet's do it again sometime!\c
For you to have defeated me, who has an IQ\nof over 300...how incredible...\c
I gave it my all and lost!\nI have no regrets.\c
It appears you have come prepared.\nPlease, go on your way.\c
What does it mean to be the best Waitress?\nIs it to provide the best service?\c
I'm so quick, I bring out the drinks in two\nseconds flat! How could I lose to you?!\c
This was great training!\nLet's survive together!\c
I lost again...\nHow did you get so much stronger?\c
This battle may be over!\nBut the adventure continues!\c
Ah ha ha...\nWhat a hilarious way to lose...\c
I see now that you're not alone!\nYou've got some great Pokémon with you!\c
I need to win more prize money so I can\nlive the easy life as an adult!\c
Impressive to have come this far!\nYou're a competent Trainer!\c
Gah! Just my luck to run into a powerful\nfoe like you just before reaching the top!\c
I can feel the strength of your resolve...\nDon't give up! Good luck!\c
Ugh... I didn't know there were Trainers\nas strong as you in here...\c
This is still just the starting line!\nTrain more and get stronger!\c
What impressive attacks!\nBut don't neglect your training!\c
Don't forget our battle!\nIt will become a source of your strength!\c
Nice! That's how you do it!\nKeep on battling like that!\c
You won't survive in the next area\nunless you're strong!\c
That's right! Refine yourself, and become\nan example for your Pokémon!\c
I gave it my all!\nI have no regrets...\c
It looks like you might be strong enough\nto look after your Pokémon, no matter what!\c
We still have room for improvement!\nThere is no wall we can't overcome!\c
I never even imagined that there could be\nsomeone strong enough to beat my Pokémon!\c
I hope I was a help in training\nyour Pokémon!\c
Oh, what rowdy Pokémon you have!\nI'm all tired out!\c
Excellent! Your Pokémon have grown strong!\nKeep up the good training!\c
Training time is over!\nThat was very productive!\c
Keep that up, and your Pokémon will be\nready in no time!\c
You sure kept up well!\nWhat a great battle!
What amazing Pokémon you've trained!\nWhat's your secret?\c
This is the extent of my power?\nI need to get stronger!\c
Nope... There's still something missing...\nWhat could it be?\c
Even with such Pokémon, I still lost?\nI guess training never ends!\c
Yes! This is the kind of excitement\nI've been looking for!\c
A true Rich Boy is elegant even in defeat!\c
I'm going to tell my daddy to give me\neven stronger Pokémon!\c
No one in my social circles could battle\nnearly as well as you!\c
How much did it cost to raise those Pokémon?\nYou crazy moneymonger!\c
Gah! Listen! I'll pay you if you just\ntake it easy on me!\c
How?! Stupid granddad!\nWhy didn't you get me stronger Pokémon?\c
Thank you very much!\nYou were an excellent dance partner. ♪\c
You're so strong...\nI'm glad I found a proper opponent!\c
Ahh! Why would you do such a thing\nto my adorable Pokémon?!\c
I used to be pretty good when I was young.\nStill, I guess getting older is unavoidable...\c
You've still got some room for improvement!\nKeep up the training!\c
You should try starting up a company!\nThere's no doubt you'd be successful!\c
Serious battles like this can only be\nenjoyed in here!\c
That's right, youngster! Climb over me\non your way to the top!\c
Thank you for providing me with enjoyment\nthat even the best luxuries can't give me!\c
What's the matter with you?!\nSit still and listen to my boasting!\c
Our battle will be talked about\nfor generations!\c
Even defeat cannot extinguish my fervent\ndesire to have it all! Ahh!\c
Phew... Our blissful time transcended all!\c
OK! I'll take care of your Pokémon now!\c
You win!\nNow show me your Pokémon!\c
I just can't beat dedicated Trainers like\nyou! Here, I'll fix up your Pokémon!\c
Such a brilliant sparkle! I shall offer my\nrecovery services!\c
Examination complete!\nYou've got some impressive Pokémon!\c
OK! Show me your tired Pokémon!\nI'll patch them up in no time!\c
It's an honor to recover such strong\nPokémon as these!\c
I lost, so I'll take a look at your Pokémon.\nI can recover any injury!\c
I knew all of their weaknesses, but I felt\nsorry for your Pokémon and held back...\c
OK! Now I'll make sure your Pokémon\nare fully recovered!\c
You're really strong!\nI think I like you!\c
How impressive you were!\nNow show me those Pokémon!\c
What brave Pokémon you have!\nYou beat me!\c
Just as I promised, I'll recover your\nPokémon! Here, show them to me!\c
And now, after our battle, it's\nrecovery time! Hope you enjoy!\c
It was a perfect battle, so I'll give your\nPokémon a perfect recovery!\c
OK! I hope you enjoy this brief moment\nof rest and recovery!\c
Phew... No point in complaining, I guess.\nTime to get back to work!\c
You beat me, so I don't have a choice.\nHere, I'll recover your Pokémon!\c
Now that your Pokémon are recovered,\ngo for the goal and don't give up!\c

Hey! Come on!\nLet's have some fun!\c
Hyuk hyuk hyuk hyuk!\nHa ha ha ha!\c\nI never stop smiling!\nLaugh with me and battle!\c
Your luck ran out when you got\nspotted by me! En garde!\c
One-two! Three-four!\nHuff puff!\c\n...What am I doing, you ask?\nExercising, of course! A Pokémon battle\r\nwill help me shed these pounds!\c
I raised my beloved Pokémon as if they\nwere my own children. Here we go!\c
You'll have to defeat me if you want\nto advance any further!\c
The boss yelled at me,\nso I ran away from the bakery.\c\nI still have a lot to learn,\nbut will you battle with me?\c
Curry buns and cream buns!\nLet's make this a gourmet-style battle!\c
Oh no, are you lost?\nCome play with me!\c
I'm checking out the course for our\npreschool's next field trip.\c\nI'd better check out how strong the\nTrainers are in here. Here I come!\c
Whoa! You look like a strong one!\nTime for battle! Hi-yah!\c
Hmph! I don't need words!\nI let my fists do the talking!\c
Ouch, ouch, ouch...\c\nThree squat repetitions, and\nmy muscles are killing me!\c\nCan you take on a frail Black Belt\nlike me?\c
I don't like weaklings!\nYou'd better not run away!\c
Me? I'm training!\nLet's battle! I want to get stronger!\c
I'm generally a pacifist, but Pokémon\nbattles are a law unto themselves, right?\c
Huh? What do you think you're looking at?\nBring out your Pokémon. It's battle time!\c
Shiny heads brighten the world!\nLet's make this battle shine, too!\c
Ugh, I've got nothing to do.\nHey, you! Pretend to be a criminal for me!\c\n...You won't get away from me,\nyou crook! Stop right there!\c
The deeper down you go,\nthe stronger the Trainers become!\c\nThis area? You've barely scratched\nthe surface!\c
When there's a mountain, I climb.\nWhen there are Pokémon, I battle!\c
So this is the renowned White Treehollow\nthat I've heard so much about!\c\nIt was worth the journey to get here.\c\nI'm going to work my way to the bottom\nand defeat each of the Trainers here!\c
Aim high and battle!\nCharge up to the peak!\c
My daughter does nothing but\nignore me lately...\c\nArgh! I'll take it out on you!\nDaddy still loves you!\c
Welcome to White Treehollow!\nAs a form of greeting, let's battle!\c
I'll be the first to beat this area!\c
I've been cleaning for 50 years!\nI won't lose to a young'un like you!\c
Gimme back mah teef!\c
Yo! Let's have ourselves an\nawesome battle!\c
The word is that some of the strongest\nTrainers in Unova gather here.\c\nI'm a weakling compared to the likes\nof them, but I'll keep on battling!\c
I'm the chosen one who will\nmake it to the top!\c
My heart is pounding.\nYou must be really strong.\c
The future is mine to behold!\nPrepare for battle!\c
Let me feel your strength--your spirit!\c
Rival detected!\nLet's see who can reach the top first.\c\nWe'll make a race of it!\nBut first, let's battle!\c
Wait... My Pokémon are telling me\nto battle you...\c
Heh heh! Bring out your Pokémon!\nI need to gather data.\c
According to my calculations, my chances\nfor victory are 120 percent!\c
I'm usually quite a serious person,\nbut I like to let loose every so often.\c\nPrepare yourself! Here I come!\c
You think you're good enough to keep\ngoing up? I'll be the judge of that!\c
The best thing to do when you're sick of\nschoolwork is to have a Pokémon battle!\c
Urgh! I'm lost!\nWhere am I supposed to go?\c\nHey! Where are you going?\nDon't leave me behind!\c
Math is my worst subject! My best\nsubject happens to be Pokémon battling.\c
Oi! I'm a proper lady, I am!\nDon't treat me like a little girl!\c
When the eyes of two Trainers meet,\nthe time for battle has come!\c
At home, my mom keeps going on and on\nabout how I need to study. I'm sick of it!\c\nThat's why I'm here. I needed a break.\nCome on! Let's have some fun!\c
Welcome!\nPlease follow me for our battle!\c
And today's main dish will be...\na battle with you!\c
May I take your order?\nWhat kind of battle would you like?\c
Excuse me!\nPlease have a battle with me!\c
Hey, hey! We run this area, and\nyou're gonna have to battle\r\nif you want to pass.\c
Someday I'll become a powerful Trainer--\none who is respected by all!\c\nLet's have a look at your Pokémon!\nChase your dreams! Let's battle!\c
Once I beat this area, I'm gonna go\nback and tell everyone how strong I am!\c\nI'll be the coolest guy in school!\c
Hmph! My Pokémon are so very, very\nmuch cuter than yours!\c
Bright smiles and sunshine... ♪\nLa la la, sunflowers are so fine... ♪\c\nTell me, do you like my song? I'm training\nto become an Idol! Let's battle!\c
Ah! You're a Trainer, too, right?\nLet's battle!\c\nHee hee! I've got three wins in a row,\nand I'm not stopping now!\c
You've gotta climb the Black Tower\nat least once if you come to Black City.\c\nThat's what I read in the guidebook.\nAnyway, let's battle!\c
All sorts of Trainers from across the\nworld gather here!\c\nCount me as one of them.\nI heard the rumors about Black Tower\r\nand came here to test my strength!\c
Hah... I'm so lost. Everything\nlooks the same here!\c\nI need some motivation to keep going.\nI know... Let's have a Pokémon battle!\c
I've run into so many types\nof Trainers in here.\c\nThose who are tough on themselves...\nThose who are gentle with their Pokémon.\c\nHee hee! I wonder which type you are.\nLet's battle and find out!\c
Now it's time for you to taste the\npower of the Pokémon Fan Club!\c
Heart is more important than talent!\nAs long as I've got love, I can't lose!\c
You've done well to make it this far.\nBut you shall not pass!\c\nHow did that sound? Did I sound imposing?\nOne way or another, here I come!\c
I'm proud of my cooking and my Pokémon.\nHere's a taste of their power!\c
I hear there are tons of much\nstronger Trainers on the lower levels!\c\nI'd better train while I still can!\nHere I come!\c
Eek! Don't surprise me like that!\nYou need to be disciplined!\c
My boss back at the bakery told me to\ncome here and train.\c\nBut what does this place have to do\nwith working at a bakery?\c\nOh, well. No point in kneading my brain\nabout it. Let's battle!\c
Nom nom nom nom...\c\nA warm bun makes a delicious lunch!\nI can't battle on an empty stomach!\c
I did my best in raising these Pokémon.\nTime to show them off!\c
I was here exploring with my\nPreschoolers, but I got left behind...\c\nI'm all alone now...\nWon't you battle with me?\c
I'm pumped up! Woooo!\nAll right! Let's do this!\c
I heard that there's a legendary\nBlack Belt down deep in this place.\c\nHis fists can crush stone,\nand he can dash like the wind!\c\nI want to be like that someday!\nAll right! Let's battle!\c
Hi-yah!\nEeee-yah!\c\nMy shouts are second to none,\nbut I still can't split even one brick!\c\nI may be weak, but my Pokémon still\nlove me. Together, we battle!\c
I've learned many moves in my\nwarrior training here.\c\nTime to put them to the test!\nHi-yah!\c
The girl that was born under the star\nof battle... It is I!\c
Everyone's always talking about battle\nthis, battle that. So tired of hearing it.\c\n...I'll still fight, though!\nThat's why I'm here, after all.\c
Hey! I'm walkin' here!\nOutta my way!\c
I hear there's some real bad dudes\ndown near the bottom of this place!\c\nYou lookin' at me? I may look bad, but I'm\nactually a pretty nice guy! Let's battle!\c
Hey! You have a suspicious look!\nYou're under arrest!\c
I heard there are some Trainers around\nthese parts who are up to no good...\c\nCould you be one of them, I wonder...\nHey! Come here for a second!\c
Are you ready for a battle?\c\nThis is White Treehollow!\nYou always need to be ready!\c
I've got my tent, my sleeping bag,\nmy lantern, and my hammer--all I need!\c\nYou're going exploring with that gear?\nYou've gotta be kidding me!\c
I'm setting up camp right here!\nOut of the way, please!\c
I poured my tears and sweat into training\nthese Pokémon! Here we go!\c
Hey, you!\nYou're not trapped, are you?\c\nSometimes people get lost in here and\ncan't find their way out.\c\nI'm always on the lookout, but since\nwe're both here, want to have a battle?\c
So dark... So quiet...\nAll alone... So tranquil...\c\nYou there...\nDon't disturb...my peace!\c
Check out my squeaky-clean Pokémon!\nHere we go!\c
This Janitor costume is simply my\ndisguise to get around by day!\c\nIf you want to know my true identity,\nyou'll have to battle me!\c
I'm here to make sure there aren't\nany gas leaks.\c\nMy days are spent supporting Trainers,\nbut I also like to battle sometimes.\c
I used all of my vacation time to come\nhere and challenge this place.\c\nI hope I can advance even more before\nI have to go back to work.\c\nYou know, since we ran into each other\nlike this, how about a battle?\c
I'm detecting a strange buildup of\nenergy in this building.\c\nIt's making me crave a battle!\c
I can use my psychic powers\nto cure shoulder stiffness!\c\nIt's got nothing to do with\nbattles, though.\c
Everyone here is so weak!\nCome on, let's get this over with.\c
I had a dream last night...\c\nYou and I were battling...\nAnd then...\c
Mmmm... Go!\nFly to the top!\c\nNo matter how many times I try it,\nI just can't seem to teleport.\c\nI guess that's life telling me not to\ntake shortcuts! Well, here we go!\c
You're my next opponent, eh?\nI won't hold back!\c
I don't get paid nearly enough for\nworking at that research lab!\c\nIf I want to live a life of luxury, I'd\nbetter make as much money here as I can.\c
The power of science is absolute!\nI shall prove it to you here and now!\c
My experiments were going nowhere,\nso I ran away from the lab.\c\nI need even more of an escape from\nreality, so please battle me!\c
I've got almost all the data I need.\nYou can be my last test subject!\c
This is Black Tower!\nPokémon battles can happen anywhere,\r\nanytime, and between anyone!\c
I'm strong, you know! I'm a warrior!\nI shall be the victor of the exam war!\c
My beloved...\c\nI thought I saw you enter this building...\nWhere have you gone?\c\nWe are destined to be together!\c\nWait, what? Don't you believe in destiny?\c
I'd better get home soon!\nBut first, let's battle!\c
My test scores are always perfect!\nAs is my smile!\c\nThey call me super-genius girl for\ngood reason! Let's battle!\c
I hear there are some really cute\nguys higher up.\c\nTee hee hee. I need to hurry up and\nget stronger! Let's battle!\c
Today's menu is slightly different\nfrom usual.\c
Excuse me! Please wait!\nYou've forgotten something!\r\nYou've forgotten to battle me!\c
This way, please! I'll bring out our\nvery best Pokémon!\c
I'm a wicked Waitress. ♪\nNo orders will be taken today!\c
Hey, any idea where the restroom is at?\c\nUh, I'm not sure how long I can hold it...\nThere's still time for a battle, though!\c
My Pokémon have gotten a lot stronger\non the way here!\c\nYou look pretty tough, though.\nTime to test our strength!\c
Boom! Check out my crazy pitching!\nEat this tornado Poké Ball!\c
Some weird-looking dude is chasing\nafter me!\c\nWhat did I do to deserve this?\c
Oh no! I've already been here!\nUhh...where am I supposed to go?\c
Hey, wait! Please play with my Pokémon!\c
Um, maybe this way...?\nOh, are you lost, too?\c\nWe're a couple of wandering wanderers.\nMay as well have a battle!\c
I came on this journey to discover\nmyself. But who am I, anyway?\c\nThe me who is thinking about who I am\nis also me, isn't it?\c\nIt's too much for me!\nLet's just have a battle!\c
My compass has been going crazy ever\nsince I entered this building.\c\nLooks like I can only rely on my senses.\nI'd better hone them in battle!\c
Let's battle! I need to make enough\nmoney so I can go traveling!\c
Even in a deep dungeon like this, I don't\nfeel lonely when I'm with my Pokémon!\c\nC'mon, y'all, let's do this!\c
I've got a knot in my back, and\na stiff shoulder, and I'm out of\r\nbreath after a few steps.\c\nBut I'm still standing! I conquered\nevery challenge on the way here!\c\nYou're the kind of kid who doesn't\nknow anything about pain!\c\nYou think you can beat me?\c
OK! Here we go!\nLet's give this battle our all!\c
How's your Pokémon training going?\nI'll lend you a hand!\c
Get your Pokémon ready!\nCome on, show me what you got!\c
I've already lost over 10 pounds since\nI started coming here!\c\nAre you here to lose weight, too?\nCome on, we can work out together!\c
Hey! You'd better be careful,\nor I'll burn you to a crisp!\c
I'm saving up to open my own bakery\nsomeday.\c\nI've got to battle a whole lot more\nif I want to save enough money!\c
I came here with my class, but\nthey all ran on ahead of me!\c\nI've got to get stronger if I want to\ncatch up with them!\c
A Teacher I may be, but I've no shortage\nof passion! Let's have a battle!\c
I need to get stronger if I want to\nprotect my friends in White Forest!\c
The strongest of the strong gather at\nthe bottom...\c\nI wonder what kind of Trainers they are.\nI can't even imagine it.\c\nI've got it! I'll make it to the bottom\nand see them for myself! Let's battle!\c
Back at the Dojo, I said that the\nonly thing a Pokémon needs is power.\c\nThe Dojo master got angry and told me\nto come here to reevaluate my thinking.\c\nArgh! Now I'm stuck in here.\nCome on, let's battle!\c
Look!\nThere's some money on the ground!\c\nHa ha! Made you look!\nAnd with your guard down, here I come!\c
You get to be my lucky 100th opponent!\c
I'll make the flowers of victory bloom\nunder this white tree! Here we go!\c
I heard there was a bunch of strong\nTrainers here, so I got all pumped up.\c\nEveryone is too strong, though. I can't\nwin! Hopefully, I can at least beat you.\c
My Pokémon are a rough bunch! They\ndon't take nuthin' from no one!\c
Peace and quiet used to be the order of\nthe day around here.\c\nEver since you Trainers began showing\nup, I haven't had a moment's rest!\c\nStop giving me more work to do!\c
Stop right there! This is a Pokémon\ninspection. Bring them out!\c
I want to get to Area 5, at least...\c\nYou say you're aiming for the bottom?\nYou don't have a chance!\c\nLooks like I'm going to have to teach\nyou a lesson about the real world!\c
My splendor is like that of a gleaming\nmountain! Think you can beat me?\c
I'm part of an expedition sent here to\nsolve the mysteries of White Treehollow.\c\nThe problem is, I got separated from the\nrest of the team!\c\nWhile we're both here, let's battle!\c
It's said that this cave appeared after\na big earthquake...\c\nI feel that there is a strong will\nat work here.\c\nI'll be the one to solve this mystery!\nHere we go!\c
I'm on the expedition that got\ndispatched to White Treehollow!\c\nUnlike the other Trainers around here,\nI'm well versed in Pokémon battles!\c
There are some extremely rare,\nancient plants growing in here!\c\nHey! Watch where you're going.\nYou just stepped on that rare grass!\c
In my old age, the only thing I have\nleft to enjoy is saving money!\c\nTime to battle, youngster!\nThe prize money is mine!\c
You just tried to litter, didn't you?\nYou won't get past me!\c
This area still isn't dangerous\nin the slightest!\c\nLet's have a battle!\nBut remember, safety first!\c
A ton of money is being spent on\nmanaging this place.\c\nI'm too low on the ladder to know\nthe reason.\c\nI just do what I'm told and battle!\c
Hmph! This area isn't challenging\nat all!\c\nI'll finish you off quickly and work\nmy way up higher!\c
...! ...!\n... ...! ... ...!\c\nMy telepathy isn't working?\nArgh...\r\nIn that case, let's battle!\c
I came to this place to battle you!\c
I hear the upper areas are full of\nsuper-strong Trainers!\c\nNone of that really matters to me,\nthough. I'm sticking to this area.\c\nCome on, let's battle!\c
Using smiles to communicate with Pokémon\nis kind of a psychic power,\r\ndon't you think?\c\nOK! Show me how well you raised your\nPokémon with your psychic communication!\c
I might be able to bend a spoon,\nbut I won't bend my beliefs!\c\nI'm aiming for the top and I won't stop!\nHere comes the noble Psychic!\c
It's always been my dream to work as\na researcher in Black Tower!\c\nWhat kind of research am I doing?\nIt's highly confidential, of course!\r\nLet's battle!\c
Behold! This is the result of my long\nyears of devoted research!\c
I smell a conspiracy brewing in\nthis building.\c\nEh? You want to know what a conspiracy\nsmells like?\c\nUmm... Err...\nForget it! Let's battle!\c
Wow, this building is so tall!\nHow does it not fall over?\c\nYou don't care?\nWell, let's battle, then!\c
My test scores are always average!\nTaste the power of the ordinary!\c
If I make it to the top floor, I'll\nbe able to pass my entrance exams!\c\nThat's what I heard, at least.\nI'm not going to let you get in my way!\c
As someone who was born in Black City,\nI want to climb Black Tower at least\r\nonce. Let's see how far I can get!\c
My sister is a really popular Waitress!\c\nI'm here working hard to become as\nnice a person as she is!\c
It's so refreshing to put my face against\nthe cool floor! It feels great!\c\nYou want to cool off, too?\nNo way! This is my floor!\c
I skipped all the way here. ♪\nTra la la! ♪ Battle time!\c
We always keep an assortment of the most\nexquisite Pokémon in order to provide our\r\nTrainers with the best possible battles!\c
I'm both a Trainer and a Waiter.\c\nPut it together, and that makes me a...\n...Traitor? What?! Take that back!\c
My little sister hasn't returned since\nshe first entered this place...\c\nOh no! Could she have been kidnapped?\c\nWas it you? Did you kidnap her?\nWhere is she? Give my sister back!\c
I was throwing a serving tray. You know,\nlike a discus. No reason to get yelled at.\c\nSo I'm here till things calm down at work!\nLet's play!\c
They say this tower goes all the way up\ninto outer space!\c\nPretty cool, huh? Heh heh. I'm going to\nbe the first to make it to space!\c
You're a Trainer, too, right?\nLet's have some fun! Battle me!\c
I trained a ton with my Pokémon, so\nwe came here to test our strength!\c\nI wonder if I can make it to the top!\c
I'm going to defeat you so I can get\nshopping money!\c
Right, try this... Let's rattle!\nErr...no, no, trying again... Let's brawl!\c\nNo, hm, rattle, brat, brawl...hmmm...\c\nTrying... Not clicking...\nHow about... Let's battle!\c
Check me out! I'm going to make it to\nthe top with these Pokémon!\c
So, whenever I win, I get prize money.\nBut where does it come from?\c\nIs everyone getting paid? That must\nadd up to a crazy amount of money!\c\nAs long as I get mine, I don't care,\nI suppose...\c
Hey, man, wanna have a battle? Let's\njust take it slow and easy.\c
My goal for this month is to make it\nto the next area!\c\nPlanning makes perfect, so they say.\nYou've got to have goals!\c
Yo! Check out the Pokémon friends\nI've made on this journey!\c
I teamed up with my daughter to\nmake it this far!\c\nWe make a strong team, and we don't plan\non losing to any Trainers in here!\c
First-class Trainers only carry\nfirst-class items!\c\nCheck out the exquisite craftsmanship\nof these Poké Balls!\c
Have you gotten used to\nWhite Treehollow?\c\nYou can't let your guard down, though!\nYou never know what you'll run into!\c
I'm not all smiles, you know!\nHere's a taste of my rage!\c
This place is perfect for training!\nMy Pokémon keep getting stronger!\c\nCheck out their progress!\c
Battle time! With this prize money, I'll\ntake my Pokémon to the hot springs!\c
Whenever I think of the bakery I'm going\nto start in the future, I feel like I can\r\novercome any obstacle!\c\nI tell you, it sure is great to have\na dream!\c
I really love rice! It's the only thing\nI can eat in the morning!\c\nSo why am I working at a bakery, you\nask? Well, where else should I work?!\c\nAgh! I can't decide what to do!\nGuess I'll take my doubts out on you!\c
I'm here with my class on a field\ntrip, but they went on ahead of me...\c\nI've been trying my best to track them\ndown, but all I've found is some graffiti.\c\nThis one says, “Slowpoke Teacher!"\nGrrr... They won't get away with this!\c
I know lots of secret techniques to\nget my Preschoolers to stop\r\ncrying and go to sleep.\c\nDo you think you can get the better\nof my secrets? Let's find out!\c
I'm going to give this battle my all\nin order to be myself!\c
I'm not going back outside until I become\nthe most awesome guy in the universe!\c
Hmph... Here comes another one.\nCan none of you give me a challenge?\c\nI'll give you weakling Trainers a\ntaste of reality!\c
When you've got a rival with which to\ncompete, it's easy to get motivated!\c\nAll right! I officially recognize you\nas my new rival!\c
My legion of Pokémon are all\nthird-tier black belts!\c
Long ago, I used to stay cooped up\nin a dark room...\c\nBut then I came here and grew stronger.\nI became a true Battle Girl!\c\nI owe it all to my Pokémon, who convinced\nme to leave that room and go outside.\c
I came here to cut loose with my bros.\c\nWe're gonna teach these punk Trainers\na thing or three about battles!\c
You the one that's been messin'\nwith my bros around here?\c\nIt's time to put an end to that!\nBring it!\c
We've got rules around these parts,\nand I'll see that they're obeyed.\c\nWho makes the rules, you ask?\nThat's not for you to know!\c
Have you lost your way?\c\nHeh heh. If you can beat me, I might\nbe able to spare a hint or two.\c\nThat's part of a Policeman's job,\nafter all.\c
Such delicious looking leaves... Munch!\nYum! A bit of this and a bit of that!\c\n...So good! Nom nom nom...\nNo, I won't share with you!\c
Sometimes traces are found that seem to\nindicate that people used to live here...\c\nCould this have been the home of some\nunknown ancient people?\c\nIt's wild thinking about it...\nAnyway, let's have a battle!\c
I've been in here so long, I can't\nremember the last time I saw a mountain.\c\nI may be a Hiker without a mountain, but\nI still know my way around a battle!\c
There's a theory that says an\nunderground people lived here long ago...\c\nDo you think there's any truth to that?\c\nI believe it. That's why I'm here doing\nthis research! Let's battle!\c
Oh! A person! Great timing!\nSay, what day is it?\c\nUh...already? If that's the case, then\nI've been in here for a week!\c\nGuess I'll battle you and then head home!\c
I'm just an ordinary investigator,\nbut I feel like a Boss Trainer!\c\nMwa ha ha!\nIf you want to go to the next area,\r\nyou'll need to defeat me first!\c
See those roots?\nThey're all part of the giant white tree!\r\nQuite a sight, aren't they?\c\nThese roots go right down to the depths!\nThink about it--here we are, fighting\r\ninside the heart of White Treehollow!\c
No future! No matter how old I get,\nI've got no future!\c\nMy Pokémon and I will show you what\npunk is all about!\c
I still need my Pokémon to get stronger!\c\nBring out your Poké Balls. Let's battle!\c
I'm on orders from the boss!\nI need to test your strength!\c
Power's all about how you use it!\nI'll show you the right way!\c
I'll obliterate any Trainer that\ncrosses my path!\c\nI intend to be the only one to survive\nBlack Tower!\c
As someone who was born in Black City,\ndark impulses swirl within me...\c\nIn order to fulfill these impulses,\nI must continue to battle in here!\c
I've seen it! The result of this battle\nis already known to me!\c
Hee hee! I'll go easy on you!\nIt will still be a breeze for me, I'm sure.\c
I'm gonna make my way to the top and\ndefeat the boss of this place!\c\nThen I'll remodel this building and\nmake it into something much cuter!\c\nA rainbow-colored skyscraper sounds\npretty nice, right? Let's get started!\c
And your rating is... Let's see...\nHere we go! Your rating is BK1192296!\c\nB-class Pokémon, huh?\nI shouldn't have any difficulty with you!\c
Under this lab coat is my aloha shirt!\nAs soon as I finish my work here,\r\nI'm going straight to Undella Town!\c\nCome on! Let me get this data from you\nquickly so I can get out of here!\c
For a researcher of Pokémon battles,\nBlack Tower is the perfect testing site!\c
Cough cough...\nSo...weak...\c\nNeed...medicine...\n...G-g-gulp!\c\nOK! Full recovery! Prepare yourself,\nbecause here I come! Hyah!\c
I don't feel like doing my homework!\nHey, how about you do it for me?\c\nNo? You want me to do my own homework?\nNo way!\c
Let's shake hands before battle!\nIt's always best to be pleasant!\c
People call me a money-grubber.\nWhy? Because I live to make money!\c\nWhen you've got money,\nyou can buy your hopes and dreams!\c\nI'm going to defeat you and get even\nmore prize money!\c
Welcome home, honey! Would you like\nto eat now or after your bath?\c\nNeither? OK!\nA Pokémon battle it is, then!\c
Tee hee hee! I've saved up a lot after\nwinning so many times in a row!\c\nIf I can defeat you, I should have\nenough to buy that Munna pillow I've\r\nalways wanted!\c
Don't you ever get tired of this\nnonstop battling?\r\nThat's why I decided to quit battling!\c\n...Kidding!\nTake this!\c
Hey, hey! They call me the rude Waiter!\c\nNothing and no one can make me be polite!\nMove it! Let's get this battle on!\c
I'm on orders to let only strong\nTrainers get past this point.\r\nLet's have your best shot!\c
I looked up my horoscope for today,\nand it said I'd have an awful day!\c\nIt's OK, though. I'll show destiny\nwho's boss!\c
Whoa, whoa, whoa!\nWatch out!\c
My mentor taught me some amazing\nstrategies! There's no way I can lose!\c
No matter how many times I fall down,\nI get back up! I've got the guts to\r\nmake it to the top!\c\nWooo! Here I go!\c
Mwa ha ha ha!\nMy dream is to take over the world!\c\nI'll start by conquering this place!\c
They say this building reaches into\nthe stars. How romantic!\r\nI want to take a swim in the Milky Way.\c\nHee hee! Here we go! I'll show you the\npower of my dreams!\c
My dad is out of work, so I've got to\nprovide for our family instead!\c\nThis prize money is mine!\c
MY POKÉ-MON...STRONG...\nTHERE-FORE...VIC-TOR-Y...\c\nHee hee. How was my robot impression?\c
The other day some kid came up to me and\nstarted calling me his mentor.\c\nI let it go to my head and taught him a\ncouple of strategies.\c\nIt was all a bunch of random stuff I made\nup, though.\r\nDon't look at me like that!\c
I'm still on my first year here, but\nI wonder how long it will take to get to\r\nthe top. I won't let you get there first!\c
How about a battle?\c\nWhen you don't think you can win,\nit might be a good idea to go train in\r\nthe lower areas.\c
If you're having trouble around here,\ndon't even think about going further!\c
All of us Pokéfans have come together to\nexplore and defeat this dungeon!\c\nWe'll be the first to reach the bottom!\c
Trying to become the best in here just\nisn't realistic for me.\c\nWhat's that? You're aiming to become\nthe strongest?\c\nYou'd better be able to beat me without\nbreaking a sweat then!\c
You may have breezed your way through\nthis place, but that stops here!\c\nIf you want to go further, you need to\nbe determined!\c\nMe, I lack determination--that's why\nI keep hanging around here and battling.\c
You're about halfway through this cave.\c\nSeems like a good time for a quick test of\nyour bonds with your Pokémon!\c
My husband and I came to challenge this\nplace together, but he gave up in the\r\nupper areas!\c\nHow pathetic!\nWell, I'm going to keep going!\c
I'd better let my Pokémon out of their\nPoké Balls pretty soon.\c\nHere we go! Time for some exercise!\c
Hrmm...\nI'm going to need a lot more money\r\nif I want to open my own bakery.\c\nI need to win more prize money!\nLet's battle!\c
You're out of breath already?\nThink you can beat me in that state?\c
Oh! Take a look at this!\nIt's more graffiti from my kids...\c\nIt says, “We're going back now."\c\nNow I know they're safe, at least.\nNow I can focus on battling you!\c
Hi! I'm not a very serious person, so\nlet's have a carefree battle!\c
I checked out the lower areas,\nbut I didn't stand a chance against any\r\nof the Trainers down there!\c\nThis area is closer to my skill level, so\nI'll train here for a while. Let's battle!\c
My heart is one with that of my Pokémon!\c\nWe want to become stronger! That's all!\nLet's go!\c
Oi! The Boss Trainer wiped the floor with\nus! We'll take revenge on you instead!\c
Check out the speed of my Pokémon!\nIs this a result of our training?\c\nThey're so fast! Can you even catch\ntheir movement?\c
You'd better train harder if you want\nto reach the lower areas!\c
I'm not sure, but I may have finally\nachieved enlightenment after all\r\nthis hard training!\c\nPossibly finally enlightened battle time!\c
Heh! I don't take it easy on anyone--\nno matter how weak they are! Come on!\c
Guys like me came here from around Unova\nto get a taste of that prize money!\c
I cannot guarantee your safety past\nthis point!\c\nThe areas below have no laws!\nYou'd best not venture any further!\c
Play by the rules for fun battles in\nWhite Treehollow.\c\nThat's this month's slogan!\nLet's have ourselves a fun battle!\c
...So you made it all the way here, huh?\nI'll see how strong you really are!\c
Hello there!\nGreeting everyone you pass is one of\r\nthe traditions of mountain climbing!\c\nIn here, though, instead of greetings,\nwe have Pokémon battles!\c
What clean air! This is one of the\nblessings of White Treehollow.\c\nLet's give our Pokémon a chance\nto smell this delicious air!\c
Hey! Didn't I run into you in one of\nthe upper areas?\c\nWell, let's see if you've gotten any\nstronger since then!\c
So many Trainers just trample their\nway through this beautiful cave...\c\nAs a defender of nature, I must take\na stand!\c
I'm sick of long prologues!\nLet's get this battle on!\c
It's up to us cleanup volunteers to\nkeep this cave free of litter!\c\nI still like to enjoy a Pokémon battle\nduring my breaks, though!\c
We're doing our best to preserve this\ncave so that Trainers can enjoy battling\r\nhere even a hundred years from now.\c\nThis is a pretty lofty goal, agreed?\nHave a Pokémon battle with me!\c
Just...one...more battle, and I'll have\ncompleted my quota for the day.\c\nOK, calling on the last of my energy now!\nJumping in!\c
Enjoy your battles here while you\nstill can.\c\nGo any further than this, and your\nbattles will be anything but fun.\r\nWith that said, bring out your Pokémon!\c
Everyone keeps saying that the areas\npast this one are terribly difficult.\c\nYou won't last five minutes unless you're\none of the strongest of the strong.\c\nSounds like a challenge!\nI'll beat them all with these Pokémon!\c
After the first move, I knew\nI had lost the battle...\r\nI'd never met a Trainer like that before.\c\nHmm... You don't look like much. This\nshouldn't be a tough battle... Let's go!\c
The time has come for me to unleash\nmy true power!\c\nWoooo!\nMy Pokémon! Awaken!\c
Phew... Take a deep breath...\nBecome one with my Pokémon...\c\nOur hearts become one...\nHere we go!\c
I'm going to win a bunch of prize money\nso I can jump in a bathtub full of money!\c\nIt's every kid's dream!\c
I can see it! That muddy, ocherous aura\nrising from you!\c\nYou do look rather strong!\nBut I won't lose to you!\c
Heh heh. Just need to finish installing\nthis surveillance camera...and done!\c\nEep! You there! You saw me, didn't you?\nI'm going to have to silence you!\c
That Trainer...\nAs a subject of research, that Trainer\r\nis of extreme interest to me.\c\nIt's Trainers like that who keep me\nentranced by the research I do here.\r\nHmm... What kind of Trainer are you?\c
Whenever I'm in an elevator or a lift, I\nget the urge to jump to feel the gravity.\c\nYou could say this jump-liftevator\nwants a battle with you!\c
Every research lab desires data from\nhigh-level Trainers.\c\nWe're all interested in seeing just how\nmuch strength Trainers can foster in\r\ntheir Pokémon.\c\nNow, it's time to get some more data!\c
I need to climb higher so I can look\ndown on ignorant fools like you!\c\nHere I come, peasant!\nBow and scrape before me!\c
You see, I'm gathering data on\nevery Trainer I can.\c\nI'm not a weak Trainer like you.\nWe're on a completely different level!\c\nHa ha! If it bothers you so much, then\nlet's settle the question with a battle!\c
There was a special column in the\nschool newspaper about my friend who\r\nmade it to the top area!\c\nMan, I'm jealous...\c\nI've gotta keep trying harder if I want\nto be like him someday!\c
My dad works in this building. His job is\nto seek out really strong Trainers!\c\nI keep training so that one day my\ndad might pick me!\c
Black City is nothing but buildings with\nnowhere to play!\c\nThis place might be kind of dangerous,\nbut it's way more fun to play here!\c\nYou can be as loud as you want, and\nno one yells at you! TAAAAAKE that!\c
To battle or not to battle... Hrmm...\nBattle...no battle...battle...\r\nNo battle...\r\nThis is the last petal...\r\nBattle!\c
Take my advice!\nThe areas above here are not safe!\c
Thank you for coming.\nWe always appreciate your patronage.\c\nToday we'll be serving a special menu.\c
Out of curiosity, I checked out the upper\nareas, but I got chased around by some\r\nbloodthirsty Trainers! Barbarians!\c\nThis area is much more soothing.\nLet's have a comfortable battle!\c
Welcome! One charming and magnificent\nbattle coming right up!\c
Argh! That goody-two-shoes geek made\nit all the way to the top!\c\nNow he's the talk of the school!\c\nGrrr... I'm green with envy.\nI want to be popular, too!\c
We Young Detectives are going to crack\nthe mystery of this strange building!\c\nI got it!\nYou--you're the one behind everything!\c
I traded for these Pokémon with my\nfriend, so we have bonds of friendship!\c
We Young Detectives are on our way!\c\nIt's our opportunity to show off our\ngreat reasoning skills!\c
The adults keep telling us that the upper\nareas are too dangerous for us!\c\nI say they're wrong! I'll be just fine\nas long as I've got my Pokémon.\c
There's so many things I want to buy\nthat I just can't keep track!\r\nHurry! I need more prize money!\c
Are you going to keep going up?\nMe, I think I'll stick to this area.\c\nThe battles are getting tougher and\ntougher, and I smell danger up there...\c\nMaybe I'll just pack it up here.\nLet's have one final battle!\c
I can't get discouraged here!\nI'm going to make it to the top\r\nbefore anyone else!\c
A letter from my mom just arrived.\nShe demands that I return home...\c\nShe has nothing on her mind but setting\nme up to get married...\c\nNever mind that.\nI'm not giving up in here! Let's battle!\c
You get this far, and it feels like you're\neven higher up than the tallest building\r\nin Black City!\c\nSo let's do it right!\nLet's call this our Battle in the Sky!\c
Whoaaa! What is up with this area?\nEveryone is crazy strong in here!\r\nWhat about you? Are you strong, too?!\c
Roaarrr!\nFirst hit for the win!\c
Over ten thousand battles, and I'm\nstill just not good enough!\c\nI need to push beyond my limits if I want\nto go any further!\c
I hear that the other Pokéfans are\nhaving lots of trouble in this area!\c\nWe were doing really great up until now!\c\nWe just need to get stronger!\nGet set! Let's battle!\c
We Pokéfans need to work together at\ntimes like this, so that we can overcome\r\nthese obstacles together!\c\nOK! I've been entrusted with the Pokémon\nof other Pokéfans! Let's battle!\c
I've fallen off the deep end, so look out!\nHere I come with my crazy Pokémon!\c
The prize-money amounts get pretty\nhuge this far in!\c\nThe more battles I win, the closer I get\nto opening up my very own bakery!\c\nHee hee! I can't wait!\nLet's get cookin'!\c
Here's a taste of what my finely\ndeveloped Pokémon can dish out!\c
Ha ha ha! This is just the beginning!\nIt gets much tougher up ahead!\c\nThe fast and furious battles in your\nfuture will surely burn you to a crisp!\c
Hey, my babies!\nCome get this Trainer!\c
Get this far in, and everyone's eyes\nare glinting with ambition...\c\nYou look pretty strong, too.\nLet's battle! Hi-yah!\c
I'm working my way to the bottom in\nsearch of the legendary Black Belt!\c\nI won't let anyone stop me!\nGet out of my way!\c
This place is sacred ground for the\nstrong! The weak may not enter!\c
They call the area below this one\nthe abyss!\c\nWeak Trainers like you have no place\nthere! Better run home to mama!\c
The strongest one in my group happens\nto be in charge of this area.\c\nIf you can't beat me, then you don't\nhave a chance against the boss!\c
No way, no way, no way!\nI don't want to lose!\c
You better watch out! I'm not like the\nother Roughnecks in here!\c
Hey! You wanna join up with me?\c\nIf we group up, we can take down\nanyone in here!\c\nWha--? You're refusing my offer?\nWho do you think you are?\c
The Trainers around here are all too\nstrong for us to control!\c\nThe strong make the rules down here,\nand the rest of us just follow along.\c\nSo, are you a rule maker or a follower?\c
My orders are simple!\nI just need to defeat you all!\c
Whoa! I can hear the voices of the\nspirits of White Treehollow!\c\nYes! Yes, I hear and understand!\nYou would have me defeat this Trainer?\c
As long as you just go one step at\na time, you'll overcome any obstacle!\c
Phew! Time for a break!\c\nOh wait...another Trainer?\c\nHumph... Will I ever have time to relax?\c
Thanks to the help of researchers and\nTrainers like you, the expedition into\r\nthese caves is progressing nicely!\c\nAs an expression of my thanks,\nwhat say we have a Pokémon battle?\c
There's some group in here called\nthe Pokémon Fan Club.\c\nSometimes there are scuffles between\nthem and members of the expedition.\c\nWait a second... Are you one of them?!\c
I'll tell it to you straight.\c\nI don't think I have the slightest\nchance of beating you.\c
Want to see what a veteran's moves are\nall about? I guess I'll give you a demo!\c
This may be a lawless area, but we've\nstill got to keep it clean!\r\nSame goes for Pokémon battles!\c
Yeah, that's right! I came here for the\nmoney at first!\c\nBut now I'm here because I want\nto meet strong Trainers!\c
Do you have talent as a Trainer?\c
Don't you get it? Open your eyes!\nWe're being watched!\c\nThat's right! Our battles are being\nmonitored by...them!\c
Can you feel this incredible power?\nThe Trainers around here all have some\r\nextremely powerful Pokémon!\c\nEspecially yours...\nNothing else in the area comes close!\c
I'll be the Boss Trainer in this area real\nsoon! You'll see!\c\nFirst things first--I'll set an example\nby defeating you!\c
I came all the way here, and every battle\nhas been a snoozefest!\c\nCan't anyone in here give me a challenge?\c
A world without love...\nIf they say power is all that matters,\r\nthen I'll use my power to change\r\nthe rules!\c
Where do you think you're going?!\nYou came all this way! I'm not going\r\nto let you just run off somewhere!\c
Even a relatively strong Trainer isn't\nlikely to be able to make it any further.\c\nHow many Trainers do you think actually\nmake it to the end of this place?\c\nMaybe one in every ten thousand.\nOnly the truly gifted can make it!\c
Battle more! Battle harder!\nShow me the explosive chemical reactions\r\nof a furious battle between Trainers!\c
Come this far, and you can forget\nlaws and rules!\c\nIn here, only the strongest are in\ntotal control...\c\nIf you can't beat puny little me,\nthen you're better off going home!\c
The strength of my Pokémon is the\nresult of a life dedicated to research!\c\nWith these Pokémon, I'm going to take\nover all of Black Tower!\c
Ah! I found a weak one!\nPounce!\c
Every time I win a battle, I use the prize\nmoney to plant a tree...\c\nI'm going green and ecoclean!\nWhat are you going to try against me?\c
Oh no! This is the end!\nWhat am I talking about?\c\nI'll tell you what! Your clean streak of\nvictories just reached a screeching halt!\c
If a battle ends too quickly, it's no fun!\nLet's take it slow and easy!\c
Heh heh! I've won so much prize money,\nI don't even see people's faces anymore.\r\nI just see the money that I can win!\c
I used to try battling at school, but no\none could stand up to me.\c\nBut the Trainers here are a blast to\nbattle against! I don't have to hold\r\nback at all!\c
The owner of the café where I work told\nme to test if your strength is for real.\c\nLet's see what we find out!\c
I see that you've finally arrived...\c\nYou'll need to give it your all if you\nwant to proceed any further!\c
Welcome to the danger zone,\nwhere power is everything!\c
Oww oww oww!\nWhat is with the Trainers around here?\c\nWhy are they all so bloodthirsty?\c\nEek! You, too? OK, I give up!\nI'll battle you!\c
That last opponent was such a weakling,\nmy Pokémon are demanding another battle!\c\nHow about you?\nCome on! No holds barred!\c
I've made it this far! There's no denying\nmy fame now!\c\nHeh heh! If I can keep this up, I'll get\nto the top and become the most famous\r\nTrainer in all of Black City!\c
Nice job getting this far!\nTime to taste the power of the\r\nPokémon of the Elite Four!\c
Do you feel someone's gaze?\nTake a look at the ceiling!\c\nSomeone's watching our battles through\nthat camera!\c
You want to go up higher?\nHow about you first worry about how\r\nyou're going to survive down here?\c
It's so calming to see the look of anger\nand despair on my opponents' faces\r\nwhenever I annihilate them in battle!\c\nHee hee hee! I'm going to wallop you\nuntil there's nothing left!\c
I've overcome countless battles on\nmy way to this area.\c\nI wonder what kind of Trainers\nare in the upper areas.\c\nI can't even imagine how strong they are.\c\nMight as well get started. Let's battle!\c
Step on the weak and obey the strong!\nThat's the only justice you'll find here!\c
I'm usually good at sensing these things.\nYou're not an ordinary Trainer, are you?\c\nWell...neither am I!\c
After all these battles and all this\nwalking... I'm still only halfway!\c\nThe road to the top sure is long!\c\nLet's take a minute to renew our\nmotivation with an invigorating battle!\c
If I want to beat the dangerous\nTrainers in here, I need to\r\nbecome dangerous myself!\c\nKyaa ha ha! Kyee hee hee!\nHere I come--one, two, threeee!\c
Hee hee! My Pokémon were in the top 100\nin a Pokéfan contest where we voted for\r\nthe strongest Pokémon!\r\nPretty incredible, huh?\c
I already came here once, but I gave up\nand went back to the surface.\c\nEveryone up there is so weak, though,\nso I came back for a challenge!\c\nI guess I just can't enjoy battles\nunless I have to scrape through...\c
After overcoming countless obstacles\ntogether, our hearts have become one!\c\nMy Pokémon are me, and I am my Pokémon!\nBattle on!\c
Looks like it's finally time for me to bring\nout this Pokémon--my secret weapon!\c
We Pokéfans came here as a group, and\nwe've really gotten to know each other\r\nduring our adventures here!\c\nNo opponent can stand in our way now!\c
One day, when I open my own bakery,\nI'm going to make all kinds of buns in the\r\nshape of Pokémon!\c\nI can't wait!\nI just need to save up more prize money!\c
I eat five meals per day! Eating so much\ngives me the energy to battle!\c
I don't have to explain to you\nwhat's about to happen here, do I?\c
Aha! Something just clicked!\c\nI haven't felt this kind of excitement in\na long time! Off we go!\c
Around here, if you let down your guard\nfor even a second, you'll lose!\c
I worked like mad with Pokémon to train\nand get stronger...\r\nBut what is true strength?\c\nIs it defeating someone who is strong?\nOr is it simply about gaining recognition?\c
Even the most ferocious Pokémon cower\nin fear before the legendary Black Belt!\r\nAway they scurry like Patrat in a hurry!\c\nMy Pokémon are a courageous bunch, so\nI've got nothing to worry about!\c
The guy I've been training with suddenly\nstarted going on about what true\r\nstrength is when we got to this area...\c\nWhat an idiot. True strength is about\nbeating strong Trainers like you!\c
I don't let physical things affect my\nperception. I look with my heart!\c
I'm going to become an even stronger\nBattle Girl and defeat the boss in here!\c
Someday I'll take over this area and turn\nit into a hive of scum and villainy!\c
Mwa ha ha ha!\nThe fools just keep falling into my trap!\c\nDrop your money and be gone with you!\nThis is a villain's paradise!\c
Sigh... I have to make the rounds all\nalone down here. It's sure lonesome.\c\nI know... I'll bring out my Pokémon,\nso I'm not alone anymore! Hey!\c
The boss is in charge here.\nWe're just following orders.\c\nSorry, newcomer, but I've got to\ntest your strength!\c
People who live in White Forest tend\nto like to take it easy. Most of them\r\nwon't even set foot in here.\c\nI'm one of the few locals in this place,\nand I'm proud of it! Let's battle!\c
I've run out of food...\nFood... Beautiful food... Give me food!\c
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?\c\nYou're a regular here now, are you?\c\nYeah? That's good!\nOK, then one...more...time!\c
Once upon a time, a bunch of Drilbur got\ntogether and competed to see who could\r\ndig the deepest!\c\nThat's how this place was made!\nPardon me? You don't like my story?\r\nThen there's no alternative. We battle!\c
It's been a long time since I joined this\nexpedition... But I still talk with my\r\nfamily every day over the Xtransceiver.\c\nStill, I miss them a lot! Let's battle.\nMy daughter gave me these Pokémon!\c
Whoa! You're the Trainer that\neveryone's been talking about!\c\nI've heard a lot about you!\nWould you have a battle with me?\c
Heh heh heh! After I retired, I took up\ntraining as a hobby.\c\nTurns out I'm pretty good,\nand now look where I am!\c\nYou look pretty strong yourself.\nLet's see who's stronger!\c
Here we go!\nFull power from the get-go!\c
I won't say it again. You should go back!\c\nThis is your last warning!\c
If you gather all the strong Trainers\nin one spot and force them to battle,\r\nthey will only get stronger!\c\nIt's all according to plan! Ha ha!\nBattle and get stronger!\c
I'm going to make it to the top and\ngo back to town as a hero!\r\nAll the girls will want to be with me!\c
Stop! You and I...\nWe must battle!\c
I've made it this whole way without\nlosing even once!\c\nI wonder what it's like to lose a battle.\c
The higher I climb, the more I feel\nthe gathering of a dark energy...\c\nI need to get stronger to be able to\nfight this gathering darkness!\c
I can see the great open sky\njust beyond that wall there.\c\nThe wind is blowing...\nThe clouds are rolling...\r\nNow that I'm calm, let's battle!\c
I just saw a family of Trainers pass\nthrough here, all relaxed and carefree!\c\nTo think, even veterans like me have a\ntough time battling in here...\c\nEveryone in here is so intense!\nWhat about you?\c
Hey! Honey, is that you?\c\n...Oops. You're not my wife.\nWhere did my wife and kids go off to?\c\nHmmm...\nLooks like Daddy is going to have to\r\nbattle this stranger all alone!\c
I saw some data regarding rapid\ngrowth around here!\c\nI came to check it out for myself!\c
Why of all places did we have to come\nto Black Tower for our family vacation?\c\nI'll just have to take it out on any\nTrainer that crosses my path!\c
I used to work here doing research on\nTrainers and Pokémon.\c\nAfter seeing the amazing battles between\nTrainers in here, I had to give it a try\r\nfor myself! That's why I quit and decided\r\nto become a Trainer!\c
I've only chosen opponents that I know\nI can beat!\c\nI'm great at judging a Trainer's\nstrength! I can tell you're weak!\c
Dad brought us here for our family\nvacation. I don't mind, but I know that\r\nmy mom and sister don't want to be here.\c\nMy dad sometimes lacks consideration...\nOh well, let's battle!\c
Oho! How unlucky for you to run into me!\nYou haven't got a chance, I'm afraid.\c
Everyone's talking about how a super-\nstrong Trainer showed up recently.\c\nWait! Could it be you?!\nHey, have a battle with me!\c
Hey! Come on!\nThere's no time for rest in here!\c
Pokémon battles are the best way\nto forget your worries!\c\nReally, as long as I have Pokémon\nbattles, I don't need anything else!\c
I'll give it my all!\nExcelsior!\c
Our mission is to serve up battles just\nas our customers like them!\c
I only battled the Boss Trainer once,\nbut I'll never forget our match!\c\nI'm training to get stronger so that\none day I can have a rematch!\c
We provide the premier battle service\nin Black Tower!\c
Brr... Brr...\nIt's getting c-c-cold in here...\c\nHey, you!\nLend me your jacket!\c
How long has it been since I started\nbattling in here?\c\nI started out as a total newbie, but\nnow I'm a true veteran Trainer!\c\nAll right!\nLet's get some practice in!\c
The other day, there was a feature in\nthe newspaper about my adventures in\r\nBlack Tower. It had my picture, too!\c\nI'm going to keep doing my best so I\ncan make the front page some day!\c
I'm so angry at my dad!\nWhy did he have to pick such a scary\r\nplace for our family vacation?\c\nHow about the beach or a theme park?\c\nGrrr! Someone has to pay for this!\nAnd that someone is you!\c
I have no liking for complicated things!\nPower is what counts in here...\c\nI love the simplicity of that!\c
My friends get all dressed up and go out\nclubbing, but it doesn't appeal to me.\c\nWhat I need is the fury of battles!\nThat's what I've dedicated my life to!\c
I found this place in my travels and\ndecided to pop in.\r\nWhat an amazing place this is!\c\nAre you another powerful Trainer, the\nlikes of which I've never before seen?\c
The areas up here are bigger than the\nones before. It's easy to get lost!\c\nAt least there are lots of strong\nTrainers to battle.\r\nNo worries about finding opponents!\c
This building is so tall, it goes straight\nthrough the atmosphere into space.\c\nI thought that was just a myth, but I'm\nstarting to believe it may be true!\c\nJust how high do I have to climb to\nreach the top of this place?\c
My Pokémon have gotten a lot stronger on\nthis long journey! Check them out!\c
Now that you've reached this area, you'll\nstart running into tons of Trainers who\r\nregularly place high in the PWT.\c\nMaybe you think you're pretty hot stuff,\nbut you'd better stay on your toes!\c
OK, OK. Time for me to show off a side of\nme that most people don't know about!\c\nThis is my bad side! My wild-thing side!\nMwa ha ha! I'm going to destroy you!\c
We've trained and trained to get here!\c\nMy Pokémon have endured so much! I've\ncried for them while offering my support!\r\nAnd it all went to bringing this victory!\c
You fit the description... You're the\nTrainer everyone's been talking about!\c\nThey say you can't be beat, but I'll\nprove them wrong here and now!\c
Oooh! Our hearts have bonded.\nI can hear them! What's that? OK, got it!\c\nMy Pokémon are communicating with me from\ninside their Poké Balls.\r\nThey want me to defeat you!\c
There's no limit to the love my Pokémon\nand I have for one another! Here we go!\c
No matter how tough things get, as long\nas you keep following your dreams,\r\nyou can always get back on your feet!\c\nMy goal of opening my very own bakery\nis my treasured dream!\r\nDo you think you can defeat my dream?\c
Pound and twist the dough. Then into the\noven it goes! Hee hee! It's baking time!\c
Only one guy has ever defeated me.\nI'll never, ever forgive him...\r\nSomeday, I'll show him. But first...\c\nA little battle will take care of you!\c
The kids at preschool call me Beauty\nBelt, 'cause I'm both pretty and strong!\c\nWhat? Humph! No, I don't force them\nto call me that!\c
I saw the legendary Black Belt going\ndown into the lower areas.\c\nHe's got a real dangerous aura about\nhim. I got spooked just being nearby!\c\nOh, you think I'm pathetic? Well, I'll\nshow you! I'm actually totally strong!\c
I've got a PWT victory under my belt!\c\nDefeating amateurs like you is like taking\ncandy from a baby!\c
I'm ready for a battle! How about you?\nYeah... You look ready to rock!\c
Seems there's some kid in here who\njust tears through the Boss Trainers.\c\nCould that be you? Guess I'll make short\nwork of you...and make a name for myself!\c
I've only come this far thanks to my\nWhite Treehollow rivals.\r\nWe compete and cheer each other on!\c
My Pokémon are a rowdy bunch!\nOur battles are really intense!\c
Yo, yo! You there, Trainer!\nYou're pretty full of yourself!\c\nI'll prove you're not as strong as they\nsay you are!\c
I'm gonna take everyone down, become\nthe boss, and make this place my own.\c\nAt least, that's what I used to say.\nBut everyone here is just too strong.\c\nI bet you're going to wipe the floor\nwith me, too!\c
Stop right there! This is the police!\nHands up! OK, now, feet up, too!\r\nStay still! Now is my chance to attack!\c
I found you!\nYou're the one they're all talking about!\c\nI'll stop you right here!\nGet ready, because here I come!\c
In a quiet place like this, do you ever\nhave the sudden desire to shout?\c\nI sure do!\nAAAAAAAAH!\c\nPhew...\nI feel a lot better now. Let's battle!\c
You must be one of the ancient\nunderground people that lives here!\c\nYes! There's no mistaking it! Show me\nthe ancient power of your people!\c
I want to go down to the lower areas\nand explore.\c\nBut the Trainers down there\nare way too strong for me...\c\nCompared to their Pokémon, mine are\nmeek, modest, and mild!\c
Hey! You're getting to be quite\nfamous around these parts!\c\nThey say your battling style is\nreally impressive.\r\nWould you mind giving me a demo?\c
So you're my next target, huh?\nI hope you can put up a fight!\c
Recently, I've even been having\ndreams about exploring this place.\c\nMan, what's wrong with me?\nAhh... Must battle more...\c
Ha ha! It's my duty and my joy to teach\nyoungsters like you a lesson in life!\c
That's right! We're all Trainers from\nbirth! Never wavering, only battling!\c
So you're the one!\c\nHow lucky for me to run into you here!\nLet's have a battle!\c
I don't have a particular reason,\nbut let me test your strength!\c
Whoosh!\nWhat is that powerful energy I feel?\c\nIf we don't do something, we'll get\nswallowed up by it! Let's battle!\c
Are you ready?\nBam!\c
Not many Trainers can make it this far.\nYou must be one of the chosen few.\c\nSo we'll battle, and it'll be a close\nmatch--closer than any you'll find below!\c
I feel a great pressure pushing down\non us from the upper areas!\c\nOoh... I'm so frightened...\nEeeeeek!\c
My Pokémon are overflowing with power!\nYou can't stop us!\c
Apparently, we're being monitored\nin here.\c\nHarrumph!\nWhoever they are, I'll give them a\r\nbattle worth watching!\c
I've heard of you! They say you've got\nsome really strong Pokémon!\c\nWhatever. No way are your Pokémon\ngonna be a match for mine!\c
Argh! Everyone in here is running\nabout and making a ruckus!\c\nWhy can't they just calm down a bit\nand help us with our research?\c
Oh! It's you! I finally found you!\nI've been looking for you!\c\nNow show me just how powerful\nyou really are!\c
Wah ha ha! I win again!\c\nForget about research!\nI just want to have fun!\c
So you're the new big star that\neveryone's been talking about, huh?\c\nI'd better knock you down now before\nyou get too big for your own good!\c
Some dude was in here talking about\nhow he won the PWT, but we battled\r\nand I beat him easily!\c\nDown here, I guess it doesn't matter how\ngood a person was back on the surface!\c
Why are you looking all absentminded?\nIn a battle of minds, I can't be beat!\c
All of my classmates gave up back\ndown in the lower areas.\c\nFor the honor of Class Tepig,\nI will defeat you!\c
Everyone in my family is a really\nstrong Trainer!\c\nI'll show you some of the techniques\nthat I've been taught since I was a kid!\c
Kneel down before me!\nI shall be the queen of this area!\c
Are you the Trainer everyone has been\ntalking about?\c\nTrue? Well, then, you shall receive\ntrue VIP service!\c
We are professional Waiters.\c\nNo matter how strong you Trainers\nbecome, we will follow and serve you!\c
I won't ever stop battling until I'm\nthe strongest Waitress in the world!\c
In order to provide the absolute\nbest possible battles,\c\nI always keep the strongest possible\nPokémon with me!\c
I'm going to take off into outer space\nfrom the roof of Black Tower!\c\nOf course I'll be going with my Pokémon!\c
Tap tap tap... Just three taps on\nmy Poké Balls is all it takes...\c\nOK! As long as I do that, there's\nno way I'll lose a battle.\c
Phew! I started all over from the bottom\nand climbed my way back up here!\c\nI'm going to sweep this area this time!\c
OK! It's quiz time!\c\nIn a few moments, a Trainer will be crying\nafter he or she is defeated by these\r\nincredible Pokémon! Now, just which\r\nTrainer will it be?\c\nThe correct answer is... You!\c
Someday, I'll be a princess!\nI'm going to save up lots of prize money\r\nand build a great white castle!\c
Ah! It's you!\c\nI hear that if I can beat you, I'll get\na ton of prize money!\r\nYou won't get away from me!\c
Get your Pokémon out here!\nI'll send you all packing!\c
There may not be anything there,\nbut I still want to reach the top!\r\nI want to show that I'm the strongest!\c\n...What fools we all are!\nLet us have a foolish battle!\c
I'm so close to the top, but it seems\nlike I've hit a wall!\r\nIs this the limit for me?\c\nNo way! I won't accept that!\c
I ran as fast as I could to get here!\nRun with me! One...two...three...go!\c
I'm always thinking about my Pokémon,\neven when I'm eating or taking a bath!\c\nMaybe that's only natural for a pro\nTrainer like me! What about you?\c
Out of all the people in the world,\nPokémon love me the most!\c\nJust this morning I got electrocuted,\nbitten, and burned by Pokémon!\c\nPokémon just love to play with me!\nHeh heh... I bet you're super jealous!\c
We may be near the bottom, but we\nPokéfans are still determined!\c
You may have done well up until now,\nbut this is the end for you!\c
Here in White Treehollow, I learned a bit\nabout the harshness of the real world.\r\nYou can't keep winning forever!\c
I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have\nto defeat your Pokémon...\c
I've almost got enough saved up to\nopen my bakery!\c\nI hate to be like this, but this victory\nmust and shall be mine!\c
I've run into all sorts of different\nTrainers from all walks of life--\r\nincluding some real weirdos!\c\nHa ha! Battling down here makes it way\neasier to relate to other people!\c
Things sure are going well for you!\c\nI think it's about time you tasted the\nbitter fruit of defeat!\c
Even adults must respect and obey\ntheir Teachers!\c
The result of our long training...\nTaste my Pokémon's secret technique!\c
Training is tough and painful!\nBut it's through such pain that we\r\nachieve true strength!\c
Alder's grandson, Benga...\c\nI don't know where he is, but the\nrumor is that he is incredibly strong!\c\nMy strength is pretty incredible, too!\nCan you withstand my attacks?!\c
Enough talk! Everything I need to\nknow can be learned through battle!\c
Make it this far, and you'll find nothing\nbut immensely strong Trainers!\c\nYou must be among the strongest!\nLet's have a battle!\c
As long as I counter your counter of\nmy counterattack, I can win!\c
The boss left us behind and went to\nthe bottom, saying he was going\r\nto go out with a bang. Bam!\c\nHe is so cool!\nI want to go out with a bang, too!\c
After today, I'm done being a Roughneck!\nI'm going to start my new life as a\r\nproper Trainer!\c\nIn honor of my fresh start, let's battle!\nAh! The exhilaration of the new!\c
No stuffy, pointless rules in here!\nYou're as free as your strength allows!\c\nThis place is a paradise for a rogue\nPoliceman like me.\c\nI never want to go back to the surface!\nI just want to battle in here forever!\c
This place cannot be mastered!\c\nYou Trainers don't seem to be aware\nof that, though. You never give up!\c
A mystery is only a mystery if you\nponder it. Stop thinking about it,\r\nand it's no longer a mystery.\c\nThat's it! I solved the mystery!\nLooks like my work here is done!\r\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it.\c
With these Pokémon, I've conquered\nmountains around the world!\c
I never said call me,\n'cause you ain't got my number.\c\nGoin' all the way to the bottom,\nstealin' all your thunder.\c\nYou know I will defeat you,\nand I ain't even tryin'.\c\nYou got no say, lost the play,\nand you'll soon be cryin'.\c\nBetter believe--don't gotta be this way.\nGet your rhyme on time and win the day!\c
The word is that you made it down here\nat an unbelievable pace.\c\nEveryone's talking about you, you know?\nShow me what you're made of!\c
Unbeatable Trainers and unsolvable\nmysteries...\c\nWe expedition members are getting tired--\ngetting to where we don't care anymore!\c\nBut not me! I'm going to keep searching\nfor the truth until the bitter end!\c
The mysteries of this cave? Who cares\nabout that anymore? Some things are\r\nbetter left alone, don't you think?\c\nI'm done with this expedition. Time for\nme to enjoy some Pokémon battles!\c
Everyone down here is so great.\nNo one litters at all!\c\nIt makes sense that high-level Trainers\nwould have high-level manners!\c\nWith no work for me to do, I've got\nplenty of time to enjoy Pokémon battles!\c
My power has founded a generation!\nThink you can beat me? You're dreaming!\c
I used to be the boss of one of the\nupper areas, but I got bored and quit.\c\nIt sure is a lot more exciting to take on\na strong Trainer as a challenger!\c
The battles between Trainers at the\nbottom are intense and destructive.\c\nI'm worried that their battles are going\nto bring this whole place down...\c
I used to always think that no one could\nbe a match for me...\c\nBut then he appeared...\nAnd everything changed...\c\nArgh! Could it be?\nCould I actually be weak?!\c
I can hear the pulsing rhythm of space...\nYes... It's very close now!\c
I keep hearing rumors about how our\nbattles are being monitored...\r\nIt's natural, I suppose.\c\nIt's inevitable that people want to\nsee a Trainer like me battle!\r\nMwahaha! I'll give them a show, all right!\c
Yawn... I'm getting sleepy.\nEveryone around here's just so weak.\c\nIt only makes sense, I suppose. I mean,\nI was the strongest before coming here.\c\nAnd then I trained here on top of that!\nNo one has a chance!\c
I was poor when I was a kid, but I've\ndone well for myself as a Trainer!\c\nWith all this prize money, I can eat\nanything I want whenever I want!\c
You must be well prepared\nif you've made it this far.\c\nNo rules! Anything goes!\nIt's all on the line, so let's battle!\c
The more data we gather,\nthe stronger we become!\c\nThe power of our analyses will one day\nsurpass the strength of you Trainers!\c
The power of science continues to\nadvance...right out of the atmosphere!\c
The strongest Trainers in the world--no,\nin all the galaxy--are waiting at the top!\c\nDo you have what it takes to get there?\c
Hmm...\c\nIn what manner must I train my Pokémon\nto match the vast strength of yours?\c\nWon't you tell me? Please?\nA company secret, you say? How selfish!\c
I understand!\nYou're obsessed with me, aren't you?\c\nIt's OK! I am pretty amazing, going\nhead-to-head with the top Trainers!\c\nSure, I'll let you battle me!\nJust this once, though!\c
After I make it to the top, I'm going to\nwrite a strategy guide for Black Tower!\c\nOnce it's published, I'll be rich!\c
I'll end this battle in 30 seconds!\nYou can't beat me!\c
I teach Pokémon battles at a famous\nTrainers' School!\c\nIf you come at me thinking I'm just some\ngirl, you'll walk away hurting!\c
I'll get revenge for my friend's sake!\nTake this!\c
I won't laugh until I've conquered\nBlack Tower!\c
May I please take your order?\nOK! The full course it is!\c\nI gathered these Pokémon from across\nthe world! Here you are!\c
You're finally nearing the end of\nBlack Tower.\c\nAre you fully prepared?\c
Agh... Gah...\nGuh!\c\nIs it just me, or is there not enough\noxygen in here? I'm getting dizzy...\c\nGasp... Huff puff... No matter...\nWe shall battle!\c
What makes a battle perfect is how we\nshow our feelings toward our Pokémon...\r\nOur kindness...enthusiasm...rigor...\r\nAll part of a great battle!\c
We're pretty high up now, aren't we?\nI wonder if we're in space yet?\c\nDon't you get an outer-space vibe\nfrom this area?\c\nTime for a space battle! Engage!\c
I was on TV the other day, but the host\nwouldn't stop babbling about this other\r\nTrainer--who wasn't even there!\r\nIt was you they were talking about!\c\nI won't stand for it!\c
It doesn't matter how strong you are!\c\nWhy? Because I believe in my partners,\nwho have been with me through it all!\c
I wonder what the town looks like\nfrom all the way up top?\c\nHee hee hee! I can't wait to see!\nI'll beat you to the top!\c
A popular Lass Trainer like me\ncan't afford to lose!\c\nIn order to keep the spotlight on me,\nI've got to keep winning! Shine on!\c
This is the first time you've appeared\nbefore me!\c\nThat means that you are born anew\nthis day! Happy birthday to you!\c
Even when I lost, I never used to think\nthat I couldn't overcome an opponent...\c\nBut this place is just too much for me.\nI'm at my limit, and it's frustrating!\c
No matter how much I try, I can't get\npast this area...\c\nEveryone in here is just too strong.\nCould this be the final challenge?\c\nHah. You look really strong, too.\nPlease, take it easy on me!\c
Wha--? We're still not at the top yet?\c\nI wonder if this place really does reach\ninto outer space.\c\nI don't know how far I can get,\nbut I may as well keep battling!\c
I can hear all sorts of explosions and\nroars coming from up above.\c\nIt sounds super dangerous.\nI wonder if I'll be OK up there...\c\n...No! I'm not scared!\nI made it all the way here, didn't I?\c
My heart is racing!\nI'm finally almost to the bottom!\c\nIt's taken so long to come this far...\c\nBut now, I've finally almost reached the\nend! Ha ha ha! Here I come!\c
Stop right there! I am the one who shall\nclaim the title as the strongest of all!\c
I'm using the strongest Pokémon around!\nHow could I lose?!\c\nWhy?! Why?! Why?!\nCome on! Tell me why!\c
I've met and said farewell to\ncountless Pokémon...\c\nThese are the Pokémon that remain!\c
Only we Pokéfans who are full of love\ncan conquer White Treehollow!\c\nThe Pokéfans will paint the world anew\nwith the power of love!\c
New prey has fallen into my trap!\nWeakness is a crime around here!\c
I've finally opened up my own bakery with\nall the prize money I won in here!\c\nI've come back to deliver warm and tasty\nbuns and battles to all the Trainers\r\nI met during my adventures here!\c
The bottom of the cave...\nIt's just about time for a rest!\c\nBut I'll bake buns like the best!\nCome on! Let's mix it up!\c
You're the new person that everyone\nsays is so powerful?\r\nImpressive to have made it this far!\c\nHee hee! This is going to be fun!\c
Think you can beat a lady like me?\nWe'll see about that... Here I come!\c
You want to battle me?\nHow sad...\c\nNothing worthwhile is born from battle.\nI've come to realize that.\c\nIf you still want to battle me, then\nI'll just have to put you to rest...\c
I've survived a good long time at the\nbottom of this abyss!\c\nI won't lose to a newcomer like you!\c
So many Trainers have come to challenge\nme, only to be soundly defeated.\c\nThey call me the legendary Black Belt!\nBattling is my life!\c
It's impressive that you've made it to\nthe bottom of White Treehollow!\c\nNow we must determine which of us is\nmore experienced. Are you experienced?\c
I can sense an aura of power\nshining from your Poké Balls...\c\nYou're not just anyone! Don't hold back!\nBattle with all your might!\c
Rrooarrr!\nI'll break this and I'll break that!\c\nI've got an urge to destroy anything\nand everything! I'll crush the world!\c
Life isn't about how you live it!\nIt's about how you go out in the end!\r\nYou've got to make a striking exit!\c\nHey! It's just about that time for me.\nI'll show you how to make a real exit!\c
No matter what bad things I've done,\nmy Pokémon have always stuck with me...\c\nI'll never let my Pokémon down!\c
Once you come this far, stuff like evil or\njustice don't matter so much anymore!\c\nBeyond being a Policeman, I'm a Trainer!\c
Even if it's just to test your skill,\nI can't believe they finally called me in.\c\nThis won't be a lukewarm battle like\nthose you've had up until now!\c
There's another personality inside me...\nIt glows when I close my eyes...\c\nOh no... From the depths of my heart...\nThe radiant shadow inside approaches...\c\nAha! Here I am, the dark bright Trainer!\nI'll knock you out with my glory! ♪\c
Where's the treasure at?!\nCould the rumors have been false?!\c\nDid you hide it from me?!\nArgh! I won't let you get the best of me!\c
Oh! It's you!\nHow have you been?\c\nStay here long enough, and you start\nto recognize everyone you run into.\c\nLet's have some fun while you're here!\nBattle away as usual!\c
There are all sorts of legends about an\nunderground people who once lived here.\c\nBut we still have no idea what this place\nactually is.\c\nJust where exactly are we having\nall of these Pokémon battles?\c
I deny anything and everything!\nI say no to every little thing I see!\c
I've been observing you from\nthe shadows!\c\nI never expected that you'd come this\nfar and grow this strong...\c\nHa ha! Just a bit more, and you'll\nbe at the top!\c
A hundred years ago, I was already an\nold man. I've had an extremely long life.\c\nThe hermit of White Treehollow is what\nthey call me! Get ready for a scrimmage!\c
I won't go back outside until my\ndaughter apologizes to me!\r\nDid she send you here?\c\nI can't believe she ate my last\nRageCandyBar! Taste my anger!\c
There's treasure at the bottom that\nwill make your dearest wish come true...\c\nI told that story to everyone, and it\nbrought all you Trainers flocking here.\c\nIf I hadn't spread that tale, I wouldn't\nhave been able to meet Trainers like you!\c
I've been letting off Sweet Scent\nall the way here!\c
This place is far above the clouds...\nPower pours down from space!\c\nCan you feel it? It's having some kind of\neffect on us! Let's find out what it does!\c
Everywhere I go, I stand above the rest!\c\nIt's equally true in this place.\nI will make it to the top!\c
Hey, did you know?\nWe used to be Clowns!\c\nHa ha ha! Clowns should be like Clowns\nand have happy battles!\c
Ahhhhhh!\nIt's no good! I can't stop it!\c\nThis power is out of control!\nHelp me, my Pokémon!\c
I wonder if it's OK not holding back\nagainst you...\c\nI'm sick of restraining myself from\ncrushing all the weaklings in here!\c
Overcoming countless Trainers,\nyou and I have made it this far!\c\nFor the sake of the fallen, let's have\na battle we won't be ashamed of!\c
Hee hee! You look like you're lost!\nI'm so happy right now!\c\nAre you wondering why? Because I'm\nthe one who designed this building!\c
Behold! The culmination of all the data\nI've painstakingly gathered!\c
Black Tower is a building that contains\nthe entire wisdom of humanity!\c\nWe will go beyond that--into outer space!\nWe shall surpass humanity!\c
Hee hee hee... You've arrived...\nMy new test subject... ♪\c
I'll show you the results of the\ntraining I've done against all the\r\npowerful Trainers who opposed me!\c
Eek! Help me!\c\nAy ay ay! There's one here, too!\c\nWhere do all you strong Trainers keep\npopping up from? This place is a deluge!\c\nForget it! I don't care anymore!\nLet's just battle and get it over with!\c
I was born able to do multiplication!\nCan you beat a super genius like me?\c
I'm number one at everything--grades,\nfootraces, training--everything!\r\nMy Pokémon are number one, too!\c
I've never seen you before!\c\nThe Trainers that make it up here\nare usually the same over and over.\r\nIt's easy to spot a newcomer like you!\c\nTee hee hee! You ready to battle? ♪\c
I want someone against whom I can test\nmy mighty intellect!\c
Excuse me...\nAs of now, you are not a guest to me!\c\nYou are just a wall I need to overcome.\n...Simply another of my rivals!\c
Welcome! This is the third avenue\nof the abyss.\c\nOnly those Trainers who have come\nprepared can hope to survive this area!\c
I will become the best Waitress in the\nworld! That's why I'm training here!\c
I'm the Waitress that they say is as\nfast as lightning!\c\nIn fact, my customers say my expert\ntiming is a little bit frightening!\c
Neglect your training even slightly, and\nyou don't stand a chance around here!\c
Ohh! I found you!\nI lost to you once before.\c\nBut I've gotten a lot stronger and\nmade it all the way up here!\c\nWhat? You don't remember me?\nI'll make sure you never forget!\c
To have run into me here...\nI truly feel sorry for you!\c\nIt's the end for you...\nI'll see to it!\c
Ah ha ha ha! Quit it!\nYou're making me laugh!\c\nIt's just so hilarious!\nYou think you can beat me?! Ha ha ha!\c
I grew up with my Pokémon.\nThey're family to me.\c\nWe came all this way together.\nI'm not alone here. I won't lose!\c
When I grow up, I'm going to stay at home\nand live quietly with my Pokémon!\c\nI won't work or anything! But to live\nlike that, I need to win here and now!\c
The road here was pretty tough, right?\c\nWhat kind of Pokémon did you use to win\nyour way here? I want to see them!\c
I'm almost at the top!\nGet out of my waaaay!\c
People who want money...\nPeople who want to fulfill their dreams...\c\nPeople come to challenge this place for\na variety of reasons.\c\nWhy did you come here?\nTell me while we battle!\c
I do it all to become the top star\nof Black City.\c\nAny Trainer who gets in my face will go\ndown in defeat, and that's a guarantee!\c
You've made it this far already!\nI'll be your training partner!\c
You want to become strong?\nOK! Then come at me full force!\c
You want power?\nThen try to defeat me!\c
The more battles under your belt,\nthe stronger your Pokémon will be!\r\nNow let's kick this thing off!\c
Beyond this point, things really start to\nget hostile. If you go on and you're not\r\nstrong enough, you'll end up getting\r\nyour Pokémon hurt!\c\nYou'd better get some training in first!\c
Pokémon mirror their Trainer's strength!\c\nIf you're aiming for the top, you need\nintegrity as well as grit!\c
When you pour everything you've got into\ntraining your Pokémon, each and every\r\nbattle is the proof of your dedication!\c
The Pokémon we train depend on us\nfor their entire lives!\c\nAre you strong enough to look after them\nin bad times as well as good?\c
Together with my Pokémon, I've overcome\nsadness and pain to come this far.\c\nI don't care how strong you might be.\nWe will defeat you!\c
My Pokémon are so strong,\nI had to keep them sealed away.\c\nThat is, until now! The time has come\nfor them to take center stage!\c\nThese are my last Pokémon!\nThere are none stronger!\c
Get your Pokémon and get over here!\nI'll lend you a hand with your training!\c
Are your Pokémon feeling OK? They look\nlike they could use some exercise.\r\nI'll play with them for a while!\c
How's your training going?\nLet me evaluate you!\c
OK! It's training time!\nHurry up and get your Pokémon out here!\c
The Trainers you'll meet up ahead are\nmuch stronger than the ones here!\r\nHee hee! I'll help you prepare for them!\c
Here I go! I won't hold back!\nHee hee! Think you can keep up?\c
I'll give you a taste of what being a pro\nPokémon Breeder is all about!\c
My Pokémon and I are going back\nto the basics with our training!\c\nI'm going to keep battling in order\nto become a better Pokémon Breeder!\c
My Pokémon are almost to the\npoint of perfection!\c\nThis battle may just be the last\npiece of the puzzle!\c
I've been a Breeder forever, but these\nare the strongest Pokémon I've seen!\c\nI can say it with full confidence--these\nPokémon are the strongest around!\c
I've got more money than I can spend...\nBut my life still lacks excitement. Sigh...\c
Viens! I invite you to an elegant battle!\c
My daddy gave me these intense Pokémon!\nCheck 'em out!\c
Social circles--so stifling... I ran away!\nThat's how I came to be here!\c\nNow, I fight for freedom!\c
It cost a ton of money to raise\nall of these Pokémon!\c\nI'll show you that my Pokémon are better\nthan those of a common peasant!\c
I find it rather entertaining to consider\npoor people squabbling over money. ♪\c\nHo ho! Perhaps I'll consider gracing you\nwith an opportunity to battle me!\c
Granddad put his sweat and tears into\ngetting these Pokémon! Can you win?\c
Do you also hear the rhythm of\nthe waltz? Shall we dance?\c
Pwf! There are so many barbarians here!\nPokémon battles were originally the\r\npastime of proper ladies and gentlemen!\c\nYou there! Tidy yourself! Straighten up!\nWe shall have a proper battle!\c
I found these winsome Pokémon in my\nfamily's garden!\c\nWith my adorable Pokémon, I'll show you\npeasants how to go about your business.\c
Bumpkin! I challenge you to a duel!\c\nHaha hem! I used to challenge people\nthat way all the time in my younger days!\c\nI am walking down nostalgia's lane...\nLet us commence a Pokémon battle!\c
My company is expanding, so I'm here\nto screen for hot new talent.\c\nWe need more Trainers!\nSay, would you like an interview?\c
Corporate management is no different\nfrom Pokémon training!\c\nThat's been my philosophy,\nand I've been quite successful!\c\nInvest in training, and your net gain is\nvictory over your opponents!\c
All those in here are just--Trainers.\nEven wealthy folk like myself!\c\nEgalitarian! Carefree! Low pressure!\nThis is a great place to battle!\c
I did some bad things when I was younger.\nWhatever it took to climb to the top!\c\nYou won't find me a weakling like\nother Gentlemen!\c
I've enjoyed many delights and luxuries\nin my time!\c\nIn the end, though, Pokémon battles\nare what I enjoy most! Let's battle!\c
It's nothing special, but do take a peek\nat my little ring here.\c\nA hundred-carat diamond--a dazzling cut!\c\n...You don't seem to be paying attention.\nI guess I'll have to punish you!\c
These Pokémon have been passed down\nfor generations in my family! Battle time!\c
I need more! More!\nI must have it all!\c\nSo many things in the world that have\nyet to come into my possession!\c\nQuickly! Give me everything you have!\c
Let the happy times begin!\nHere we go!\c
You want me to help your Pokémon heal?\nYou're going to have to beat me first!\c\nYou may think I'm being hard hearted.\nI understand, but those are the rules!\c
If you manage to beat me, I'll get your\nPokémon all fixed up! So let's go there!\c
I may not look it, but I used to be the\nstrongest Trainer in my village!\c\nCome, let's battle! If you beat me,\nI'll help your Pokémon recover!\c
If you want me to heal up your Pokémon,\nyou'd better show me a glimmer of life!\c
You need to know all about Pokémon\nin order for them to recover properly!\c\nThat's my methodology.\nI make my diagnoses during battle!\c
Trainers engaged in fierce competition...\nBeing dispatched here was a bright day!\c\nAs a Doctor, it pleases me to work in a\nplace of such passion! Prepare to battle!\c
You have made it all the way here, which\nmeans you're not just any old Trainer!\c\nShow me your power! If you can beat me,\nI'll restore your Pokémon's health!\c
I'm a first-class Doctor!\nI receive adequate compensation...\c\nSome might say more than adequate!\c\nFor today, I'm offering a special service.\nBeat me, and I'll look at your Pokémon!\c
I know all there is to know about the\nbodies of Pokémon! Think you can beat me?\c
No matter how rough the area is, as long\nas there are Pokémon in pain, we Doctors\r\nwill be on the scene!\c\nHowever, before I can treat your\nPokémon, it's time for the ritual battle!\c
I have a soft spot for the strong! If you\ncan beat me, I'll treat your Pokémon!\c
If you can defeat us Nurses, we'll\nheal your Pokémon once each!\c
If you want me to treat your Pokémon,\nyou'll need to defeat me first!\c
I bet your Pokémon are tired!\nIf you can beat me, I'll fix 'em right up!\c
Hello! Sorry to keep you waiting!\nHere I am--your favorite Nurse!\c\nSimply defeat me in battle, and I'll heal\nup your Pokémon! Ready, dear?\c
Drop your guard, and you'll be defeated\nbefore I can help your Pokémon recover!\c
Hee hee! Relieved to have run into me?\c\nSure, I'll help your Pokémon recover!\nBut only if you can beat me first!\c
I'm super-duper busy here, with Trainers\nshowing up nonstop with their tired and\r\nsore Pokémon!\c\nI'm tired, too! Who will help me recover?!\c
Humph! I don't particularly feel like\nlifting a finger for your Pokémon!\c\nI'm not joking!\nI'll beat you right here and now!\c
I'll refresh your Pokémon so they have\nthe strength to make it to the goal!\c

Hi there!\c\nWelcome to the world of Pokémon!\c
My name is Professor Juniper.\nEveryone calls me the Pokémon Professor!\c
That's right! This world is widely\ninhabited by mysterious creatures\r\ncalled Pokémon!\c
Pokémon have mysterious powers.\nThey come in many shapes\r\nand live in many different places.\c\nWe humans live happily with Pokémon!\nLiving and working together,\r\nwe complement each other.\c\nWe help each other out to\naccomplish difficult tasks.\c\nHaving Pokémon battle one another\nis particularly popular, and it deepens\r\nthe bonds between people and Pokémon.\r\nAnd that is why I research Pokémon.\c
Well, that's enough from me...\nCould you tell me about yourself?\c
Are you a boy?\nOr a girl?\c
You're a boy, right?\c
You're a girl, right?\c
     
     
I'd like to know your name.\c\nPlease tell me.\c
Your name is [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c
Your name is [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c
YES
NO
So your name's [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWhat a wonderful name!\c
Well then. I'm going to introduce you\nto your two best friends!\c
Could you tell me a little about your\nfriend--the older boy who lives nearby?\c
Would you mind telling me his name?\c
Hugh
    
    
       
[VAR 0100(0001)]?\nDid I get that right?\c
                                                    
                                                
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI'm going to entrust you with a Pokémon.\nI'm sure you will be great partners!\c
The moment you choose the\nPokémon that will accompany\r\nyou on your journey,\r\nyour story will truly begin.\c\nDuring your journey, you will meet many\nPokémon and people with different\r\npersonalities and points of view.\c\nI really hope you learn what is important\nto you as a result of your travels...\c\nThat's right! Befriend new people and\nPokémon and grow as a person!\c\nThat's the most important goal\nof your journey!\c\nLet's go visit the world of Pokémon!\c

You may see pink mist from time to time.\nIf you hit it with your Poké Ball,\nthe Pokémon will fall asleep.\n\nPokémon cannot move while sleeping,\nso this makes it easier to catch them.

I want to go home with\n[VAR 011C(0000)]...
[VAR 011C(0000)]!\n[VAR 011C(0001)]!
I see [VAR 011C(0000)]\nright in front of me!
[VAR 011C(0000)]?\nI didn't see that coming!
I was confident about\n[VAR 011C(0000)], too.
You're [VAR 011C(0000)],\naren't you?
[VAR 011C(0000)]!\nCan't be anything else but.
I want to be like [VAR 011C(0000)]!
It might be\n[VAR 011C(0000)] already...
I think [VAR 011C(0000)]\nshould do.
The way I feel now is\n[VAR 011C(0000)]...
[VAR 011C(0000)] won't work!
Nothing beats [VAR 011C(0000)]!
My head's filled with only\n[VAR 011C(0000)] now!
Is it because [VAR 011C(0000)]\nwas lacking?
Isn't [VAR 011C(0000)]\n[VAR 011C(0001)]?
Aww... That's really\n[VAR 011C(0000)]...

[VAR 011C(0000)] is so\n[VAR 011C(0001)]!
[VAR 011C(0000)] bothers me.
After all, it's [VAR 011C(0000)],\nisn't it?

The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: (...A guy like that\nis a champion of justice...)\r\n(...How appalling...)
Mecha Cop: I've got you cornered,\n[VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja!\r\nSurrender!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Argh...sigh...\c\nHey, Mecha Cop...\nYeah, you got me.\r\nSo will you grant my last request?
Mecha Cop: Well, what is it?
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Battle me!
Mecha Cop: In recognition of you as\nmy archenemy, [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja...\c\nChallenge accepted!\nLet's battle!\r\nSéquence d'activation... Action!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Let me go!
Mecha Cop: Even if she is a villain,\nreaching out to her\r\nif she asks for help...\c\n...may also be justice...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Ready to rock,\nMecha Cop?
Mecha Cop: Bring it!\nThis battle is for keeps!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Heh!\nIt's been a long time since\r\nI've had so much fun battling!
Mecha Cop: I labeled every criminal a villain.\nOnce someone has a label slapped on them,\r\nthat label becomes a signpost of how to\r\ntreat them. Thinking about it...\c\nOnce I labeled you a villain, I no longer\ntreated you like a fellow human being.\c\nBut criminals are still human beings.\nTheir crimes may be unforgivable, but\r\ntheir human dignity must still be respected,\r\nor there would be no way to tell the\r\ndifference between justice and injustice.
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: ...\nMecha Cop...?
Mecha Cop: Justice...\nReal justice, that I can believe in...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Mecha Cop...\nBy any chance, are you taking it easy on me?
Mecha Cop: Time will be the judge of that...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Get hold of yourself!\nYou represent the World Police,\r\nand I'm a thief, a criminal, a villain!\r\nWe...are...enemies!
Mecha Cop: [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja.\nOur battles have made me question\r\nthe definition of justice...\c\nAs a secret detective, I'm a failure.\nThe last thing that I can do for you is...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Get a grip, crybaby!\nMy archenemy, Mecha Cop,\r\nwouldn't show himself to be a pushover!
Mecha Cop: Protecting justice...\c\n...A concept I no longer believe in.\nNothing really matters anymore...
Mecha Cop: I was trapped in a mechanical\nframework of justice.\r\nYou've woken me up.\r\n[VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Gulp...\nWhat are you trying to say?
Mecha Cop: But you are a thief.\nI cannot forgive your crimes...\c\nBut...if you pay for your crimes,\nthen, together, we...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Say no more!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Wait...\nWhat do you mean--nothing matters anymore?
Mecha Cop: Justice, evil...\nA robot can't tell the difference.\c\nPush my buttons, and I recite the\ncode of the World Police.
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: You...\nYou've changed...
Mecha Cop: Changed?\nWhat do you mean?\c\nAll I've ever been is a cog in the wheel,\na mouthpiece for the World Police...\c\nAn antiseptic,\nunemotional\r\nrobot.
Riot Police: Calling all members!\nApprehend the [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja immediately!
Mecha Cop: Wait.\nShe won't run away anymore...\r\nRight? The...[VAR 0102(0000)]...Ninja...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Tee hee hee.\nI lost, Mecha Cop...
Mecha Cop: Mission accomplie.\c\nNow, [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja,\nit's time for you to pay for your crimes.\r\nReady to turn over a new leaf...?
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: ...\c\n...\nThanks...
Thus, the [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja, who escaped\nprison so many times before, went to prison\r\nat the hands of Mecha Cop.\c\nAnd the [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja never again\nattempted escape...so they say...
Then, several years later...\c\nThe secret detective, Mecha Cop,\nwho protects citizens from crime,\c\nhas a new partner at his side.\nA partner by the name of...The [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nListen to your human side, Mecha Cop!\nCondemn the crime, not the criminal.
Mecha Cop: I lost. I failed.\nSchluss, aus, finito!\r\nGo! Run! Get away!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Mecha Cop!\nI'm disappointed in you.
Mecha Cop: After all, I'm just...\n...a cyborg.\r\nI lost my heart a long time ago.\c\nWhat...?\n...\r\nTears, idle tears...\r\nI know not what they mean...
Thus, The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja, who escaped\nfrom prison so many times before...escaped\r\nfrom Mecha Cop's grasp once again.\c\nSoon after, Mecha Cop left the World Police,\c\nand The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja\nceased her life of thievery.\c\nIs this what you wanted, Mecha Cop?\nSomeday, your heart will\r\ntell itself what to do.
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Sweet freedom!\nAs for the World Police--so predictable!\c\nNo matter how many secret detectives\nyou send after me,\r\nyou can't catch me!
Riot Police: There she is! Stop her!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Farewell,\nladies and gentlemen of the World Police!
Riot Police: Wha... Amazing!\nShe flew! How did she do that?
Mecha Cop: [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja!\nWait! ...Wait!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja, who escaped\nfrom prison so many times before...\r\nescaped from Mecha Cop's grasp once more.
Fifty years pass...\c\nThe spry [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja\nis still running, and Mecha Cop, nearly ready\r\nfor the scrap heap, is still chasing her,\r\nand running...and escaping...\r\nand chasing...and...\c\nTake a break already, Mecha Cop!\nSomebody, make them stop!
Riot Police: Woot!\nWe'll catch the [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: I think not...\nI'll never be captured by the likes of you...
Mecha Cop: Stop!\nEven when facing a villain,\c\nit's not fair to interrupt a\none-on-one Pokémon battle!\r\nFor shame!
Riot Police: We're sorry,\nMecha Cop...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Heh! No kidding!\nEverybody wants a free pass to get\r\naway with unfair things like that.\c\nAfter all, what you call justice is...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Obsolete.
Mecha Cop: That's not true!\c\nWhenever, wherever, and whoever\nmakes the effort to do the right thing--\r\nhe or she can be a champion of justice!\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja!\nKnow what? You're no exception yourself.
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja: Old fashioned.
Mecha Cop: Wh-what?\nA simple trench coat over a metal body--\r\nI'm as fashion forward as I can get.\c\nYou're the one in need of a\ncostume intervention, [VAR 0102(0000)] Ninja!

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Tch!\nHas it found me?!
UFO: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\nSo, it comes to this...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey! UFO!\nListen up!
UFO: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, UFO!\nWhat are you trying to do here?\r\nAre you planning to conquer this planet?\c\nIn that case...\nI can help!\c\nI'll cooperate with you, and\nin return, you let me go.\r\nWhat do you say?
UFO: ...
Terrorized by the UFO attacks,\n[VAR 0100(0001)] gave way to his fears.\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)] betrayed humanity...\c\nIn later times, [VAR 0100(0001)] became the\nmouthpiece and agent of the UFO...\c\nHis appearance...horrifyingly altered...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: OK.\nAll civilians have been evacuated.\c\nNow to take care of that UFO!
UFO: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wh-what?\nThe UFO is vanishing into space!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Did it give up?\nWas it...retreating?
???: ...No.\c\n...The UFO did not retreat...
A mysterious UFO appeared out of nowhere\nand started capturing human beings...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)] rescued many\npeople from this fearful situation.\c\nBut who is this mysterious person who\nhas appeared before him?\c\nHumanity's continued existence is at stake!\nAnd the battle has just begun...

E: Well...\c\nThe basic functionality\nshouldn't be bad, but...
E: If this test shows no problem\nwith durability...
E: Hmm...
E: OK.\nThe test is almost complete.\c\nUse the Zap Cannon to stop the UFO!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um, why do you have a UFO?\c\nAnd what are we going to do with it?
E: Next, I'll test the abilities of\nthe decoy UFO I developed.\c\nAre you ready, [VAR 0100(0001)]?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\c\nTest?\nDecoy UFO...?
E: Save your questions for later.\c\nJust follow my instructions.\c\nYou have a Pokémon, don't you?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?\nFight against the UFO?
E: Exactly.\nThe UFO is programmed to keep\r\nattacking you.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Bwuh?\nThat's not dangerous?
E: Tsk. Of course it's dangerous.\nHow else can you test properly?\c\nOh, and let me caution you...\c\nThe coating on the frame of this\nUFO has not yet been perfected.\c\nDamage from moves other than Zap Cannon\nwill ruin it.\c\nSo watch what you're doing! Got it?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Got it!
E: Commence testing.\c\nWhen you're ready,\nbegin attacking the UFO!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmm.\c\nThe closer I look at it,\nthe more authentic it looks.\c\nIt doesn't seem any different from\na real UFO...
E: Pay attention, please!\c\nNext, we'll test the functionality\nof the shield system...\c\nFocus energy from your\nPokémon on the UFO!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: On it!
E: Sounds good!\nGive it all you've got!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Eh? What?
E: Why are you so slow?\nQuickly, now. Do as I say!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Urk. Don't flip out...
E: I'm warning you, get focused.\nOr I won't be responsible for\r\nwhatever happens...
E: OK, enough.\nThe test was successful.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Phew...\nWhat is this test for, exactly?\c\nAnd what's the story of this decoy\nyou mentioned earlier? What's a decoy?
E: Certain creatures that live in groups\nhave a habit of gathering when they\r\nsee others of their kind...\c\nSeeing one of them signals to the others\nthat it's safe to gather.\c\nThat one is called a decoy.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I think I get it.\nBut what does that have to do with--
E: OK, listen. My research has clearly shown\nthat UFOs begin gathering once a place\r\nappears to be safe...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You mean, real UFOs will gather\nnext to a decoy UFO because\r\nthey think it's safe?
E: Exactly.\nBut there's more.\c\nI'm not going to use the decoy UFO to\nattract ordinary UFOs.\c\nWhat I'm looking for is their mothership.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Their mothership?
E: Right.\c\nMy objective is to lure the mothership--\nthink of it as the UFO boss.\c\nIf we can destroy the mothership,\nthe remaining UFOs will panic and retreat.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sounds like a plan!
E: Listen up, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nI've done the research and development.\nSo, your role in this plan...\c\nAs a member of the Unova Defense Force,\nthe destruction of the mothership\r\nis up to you!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm on board!\c\nBut, one thing I'm kind of wondering...\nHow do you know so much about UFOs?
E: What did I say about staying focused?\c\nDon't ask questions you don't need\nthe answers to, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nYou know your role.\nFocus on making my plan a success!
E, the mysterious scientist, has provided\na meticulous analysis of the UFOs.\c\nE and [VAR 0100(0001)] now undertake a critical\nmission to save humanity from the invaders!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Pant...pant...
E: What seems to be the\nproblem, [VAR 0100(0001)]?\c\nThe test is incomplete.\nNow, get on your feet!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's all I've got.\nI'm exhausted.\c\nWe don't know for sure that the planet's\nabout to be destroyed, do we?\c\nIt should be OK if we rest for a moment.\nUrghhh. So tired.\r\nSo hungry and thirsty.
E: Your weakness surprises me.\c\nI may have made a mistake\nthinking I could count on you.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Excuse me?!\nYou've got a mean mouth!
E: Enough!\c\nHumanity's survival may be down to a few\nremaining hours.\c\nI need to find someone who can do the job!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: There she goes... Oh, well.\c\nThere's no Trainer stronger than me\nanyway. So she'll be back sooner or later.\c\nOh, urgghhh...\c\nSo tired. Gotta take a break...
Not realizing that the scientist E had gone\nfor good, [VAR 0100(0001)] fell soundly asleep.\r\nZzz... Zzz...\c\nHour upon hour passed.\c\nWhile [VAR 0100(0001)] snored and drooled, the\nUFOs carried out their attacks unopposed.\r\nAnd so, humanity perished...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Urgh...urgh...
E: What's the matter?\nThe test hasn't been completed yet.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait...\c\nI don't have any Pokémon to fight with...
E: There's no other way, then.\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]--fight the UFO!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?
E: If you try, you can do it.\nActually, you have to do it!\c\nThere's no other choice.\nNow...attack the UFO!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Are you crazy?
E: I'm starting the test now.\c\nI won't let you leave until\nwe get the data we need.
With no Pokémon to help, [VAR 0100(0001)]\ntried to complete the test.\c\nBut a test with a human being alone could\nnot produce the data E needed.\c\nAs they tried again and again to complete\nthe test, swarms of UFOs descended.\r\nAnd so, humanity perished...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oops!\nDid I overdo it?
E: [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes?
E: What have you done?\c\nYou've ruined the UFO!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Er, sorry.
E: Were you paying attention\nto what I said?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Sorry.
E: The fate of humanity\ndepends on this UFO!\c\nThere's no use in saying sorry!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Sorry.
E: I don't want to hear you bleating\n“sorry, sorry, sorry." Useless!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: S-sorry.
E: I expect you to pay the cost of repairs.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yeah, I guess.
E: Let's see. Repairing this UFO will cost\napproximately $1,000,000,000.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wha...\c\nWhaaaaat?!
E: I take it that you're unwilling to pay...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't pay that!
E: Then, until you can pay off your debt,\nyou'll work as my assistant for free.
Having carelessly ruined the UFO developed\nby the mysterious scientist E, [VAR 0100(0001)] is\r\nsaddled with a debt too huge to ever repay.\c\nShe will be at E's beck and call\nfor the rest of her life.
UFO: Vwwwssssh!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What's wrong?\nSomething is wrong with the UFO...
UFO: Vwwwssssh! Vwwwzzzzt!
E: Stop, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nDon't use that move!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?
E: Wait, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nNever, ever use that move on the UFO!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Got it, got it...\nNo need to get so mad.
E: Listen and remember.\c\nThis UFO is a highly developed machine.\nThat move could cause its control system\r\nto malfunction.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Got it.\c\n(...Hmmm. Seems like the UFO has a\nweak point when it comes to Gravity...)

Shouting Woman: Enough is enough!\nCan't somebody take care of this UFO!
UFO: ...
Elderly Man: Augh!\nThat horrible UFO!
UFO: ...
Radio: Attention, attention! All points!\nDo you copy, [VAR 0100(0001)]?\r\nReport on the situation status!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Copy that!\c\nThe UFO has appeared again!\nThis time, it's attacking Pokémon\r\nwhile destroying the town!
Radio: We copy.\c\nFirst people, and now Pokémon...\nWhat are they up to?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Here's the plan of action.\nI'm depending on E to lure in the\r\nmothership with her decoy UFO!
Radio: We copy.\nOne question, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nThe person who identified herself as E...\nCan we trust her?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I...don't have an answer.\c\nBut since our understanding of the UFO is so\nlimited, we have to go with what we've got.\c\nE is certainly mysterious. I suspect...\nBut we have to depend on her right now.
Radio: C-copy that, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nFor now, we'll just have to trust her and\nhope you both succeed!\c\nWe are ready to commence the decoy plan.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ready and waiting!
Fleeing Citizen: Quick, run!\nYou'll be done if the UFO catches you!
UFO: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh!\nWhy hasn't E contacted me?
Radio: ...I heard you.\n[VAR 0100(0001)], is everything prepared?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Is that you, E?\nWhat's your situation?
Radio: I'll be arriving with the\ndecoy UFO momentarily. But...\c\nThere are more people around\nthan I bargained for.\r\nNot as many ran away as I expected...\c\nIf I meet you there and the mothership\nappears, all those people will be in danger.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no!\nIs there anything we can do?
Radio: I think not.\c\nFocus on the mission, not the people.\c\nThe mission's success is what's important.\nWe have to accept some collateral damage.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Is that so...?
Radio: ...\c\nForget it. I don't expect you to understand\nthe importance of my mission...\c\nI'm approaching your position. Get ready!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Whatever...
Radio: Try to understand this, at least.\c\nYou can't snap your fingers and change the\nfundamental principles of the universe.\c\nWhatever happens, happens...\naccording to the principles.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: NO!!
Radio: So emotional.\c\n...\c\nTch, tch. Do yell a bit louder!\nThat will certainly change how the\r\nuniverse works. Not...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You're serious--
Radio: I am completely serious.\c\nI will do whatever I have to do.\nNo more, no less.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yay!\nThe UFO is retreating!
UFO: ...
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nCan you hear me? It's me.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: E, it's you!\nWe succeeded in protecting everyone\r\nfrom the UFO!\c\nWhat's your situation?
Radio: Good news, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nJust as I planned, the mothership\nwill soon be landing.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: The moment we've been\nwaiting for...
Radio: Ah ha ha ha...\c\nWhen the mothership lands, the UFOs'\npower will be amplified many times over.\c\nIt will be much easier to exterminate\nthe remaining human beings, too...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: E.\nWhat are you saying?!
Radio: Don't you get it?\nPoor, silly human...\c\nYou've been deceived.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Human?\c\nE...\nWhat in the world are you?
With the success of the decoy plan,\nthe landing of the mothership,\r\nand E's revelation...\c\nThe battle between humanity and the UFOs\nnow reaches the final act...\r\nAnd the stakes are nothing less than\r\nthe future of humanity!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Things have gone south.\nMy Pokémon are exhausted.\c\nIf this continues, you can forget about\nthe mission!
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)].\nIt's me, E.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: E!
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nWhat's your situation like?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's bad!\nIf things stay like this,\r\nI'll be finished, too!\c\nI'm sorry to have to ask, but will you\ncancel the mission and come and rescue me?
Radio: ...\nI'm sorry, but that's not possible.\c\nI was detected by a UFO, and\nthe decoy UFO was attacked...\r\nDon't think I...can hold on...much longer...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no!
Radio: Sorry...\c\nThe decoy plan was a failure...\c\nYou must...\c\nGet away...from there...quickly...\c\n...
The decoy UFO was destroyed,\nand E's energy was completely depleted.\c\nWith the failure of the decoy plan,\nhumanity lost its battle against the UFOs...\c\nAnd the future of humanity reached its\nultimate end...
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nIt's me, E.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's you, E...\c\nS-sorry...\nI...can't move...anymore...
Radio: I understand.\c\nThen...\nI'll carry out the rest of my plan alone.\c\nWe'll soon see the mothership in the sky...\c\nBut, with only my power, we have no chance.\nI'll get inside the decoy UFO, and when\r\nthe mothership takes it on board,\r\nI'll blow up the decoy UFO and destroy\r\nthe mothership from the inside...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You're crazy!\nIt will never work!
Radio: I know.\nBut it's our only hope.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: But, E, how will you get away?
Radio: If I put the decoy UFO on autopilot,\nit will be shot down easily by convoy UFOs.\c\nI must stay in control of the decoy UFO\nand take it into the mothership myself.\c\n...\c\nFarewell, [VAR 0100(0001)].
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No! E...
And so, E took over [VAR 0100(0001)]'s mission\nand piloted the decoy UFO into the heart\r\nof the mothership.\c\nThe explosion--too distant to be heard...\c\nDebris from the mothership tumbled\nto the ground.\r\n...And all the UFOs vanished from the sky.\c\nWith humanity's battle won, people rejoiced.\c\nBut... Forever absent from the celebration\nwas the mysterious woman...known as E.
Child: Waaaaugh!\nMy Pokémon!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\nI didn't know it was a citizen's Pokémon\r\ncaptured by the UFO...
Child: What have you done!\nYou're from the UFO, aren't you?\r\nHorrible alien!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No! No!\nI didn't mean to!

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Argh!
A simple mistake by [VAR 0100(0001)] that\nhurt a citizen's Pokémon...\c\nIn her shock and dismay,\nshe was vulnerable.\r\nThe UFOs did not hesitate to strike!\c\nWith [VAR 0100(0001)] defeated,\nthe decoy plan failed...\c\nHumanity lost its battle against the UFOs...\c\nAnd the future of humanity reached its\nultimate end...

UFO: ...
Grieving Woman: Stop!\nDon't take my precious Pokémon!
UFO: ...
Annoyed Man: You stinking UFO!\nWhat are you going to do\r\nwith my Pokémon?!
UFO: ...
Captured Man: Ouch!\nHey! Let me go!\r\nI'm not a Pokémon!
UFO: ...
Whimpering Man: I beg you! Please!\nNot my dearest Pokémon!
UFO: ...
Shouting Woman: Enough is enough!\nCan't somebody take care of this UFO!
UFO: ...
Elderly Man: Augh!\nThat horrible UFO!
UFO: ...
Radio: Attention, attention! All points!\nDo you copy, [VAR 0100(0001)]?\r\nReport on the situation status!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Copy that!\c\nThe UFO has appeared again!\nThis time, it's attacking Pokémon\r\nwhile destroying the town!
Radio: We copy.\c\nFirst people, and now Pokémon...\nWhat are they up to?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Here's the plan of action.\nI'm depending on E to lure in the\r\nmothership with her decoy UFO!
Radio: We copy.\nOne question, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nThe person who identified herself as E...\nCan we trust her?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I...don't have an answer.\c\nBut since our understanding of the UFO is so\nlimited, we have to go with what we've got.\c\nE is certainly mysterious. I suspect...\nBut we have to depend on her right now.
Radio: C-copy that, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nFor now, we'll just have to trust her and\nhope you both succeed!\c\nWe are ready to commence the decoy plan.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ready and waiting!
Fleeing Citizen: Quick, run!\nYou'll be done if the UFO catches you!
UFO: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh!\nWhy hasn't E contacted me?
Radio: ...I heard you.\n[VAR 0100(0001)], is everything prepared?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Is that you, E?\nWhat's your situation?
Radio: I'll be arriving with the\ndecoy UFO momentarily. But...\c\nThere are more people around\nthan I bargained for.\r\nNot as many ran away as I expected...\c\nIf I meet you there and the mothership\nappears, all those people will be in danger.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no!\nIs there anything we can do?
Radio: I think not.\c\nFocus on the mission, not the people.\c\nThe mission's success is what's important.\nWe have to accept some collateral damage.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Is that so...?
Radio: ...\c\nForget it. I don't expect you to understand\nthe importance of my mission...\c\nI'm approaching your position. Get ready!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Whatever...
Radio: Try to understand this, at least.\c\nYou can't snap your fingers and change the\nfundamental principles of the universe.\c\nWhatever happens, happens...\naccording to the principles.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: NO!!
Radio: So emotional.\c\n...\c\nTch, tch. Do yell a bit louder!\nThat will certainly change how the\r\nuniverse works. Not...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You're serious--
Radio: I am completely serious.\c\nI will do whatever I have to do.\nNo more, no less.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yay!\nThe UFO is retreating!
UFO: ...
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nCan you hear me? It's me.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: E, it's you!\nWe succeeded in protecting everyone\r\nfrom the UFO!\c\nWhat's your situation?
Radio: Good news, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nJust as I planned, the mothership\nwill soon be landing.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: The moment we've been\nwaiting for...
Radio: Ah ha ha ha...\c\nWhen the mothership lands, the UFOs'\npower will be amplified many times over.\c\nIt will be much easier to exterminate\nthe remaining human beings, too...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: E.\nWhat...what are you saying?!
Radio: Don't you get it?\nPoor, silly human...\c\nYou've been deceived.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Human?\c\nE...\nWhat in the world are you?
With the success of the decoy plan,\nthe landing of the mothership,\r\nand E's revelation...\c\nThe battle between humanity and the UFOs\nnow reaches the final act...\r\nAnd the stakes are nothing less than\r\nthe future of humanity!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Things have gone south.\nMy Pokémon are exhausted.\c\nIf this continues, you can forget about\nthe mission!
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)].\nIt's me, E.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: E!
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nWhat's your situation like?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's bad!\nIf things stay like this,\r\nI'll be finished, too!\c\nI'm sorry to have to ask, but will you\ncancel the mission and come and rescue me?
Radio: ...\nI'm sorry, but that's not possible.\c\nI was detected by a UFO, and\nthe decoy UFO was attacked...\r\nDon't think I...can hold on...much longer...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no!
Radio: Sorry...\c\nThe decoy plan was a failure...\c\nYou must...\c\nGet away...from there...quickly...\c\n...
The decoy UFO was destroyed,\nand E's energy was completely depleted.\c\nWith the failure of the decoy plan,\nhumanity lost its battle against the UFOs...\c\nAnd the future of humanity reached its\nultimate end...
Radio: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nIt's me, E.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's you, E...\c\nS-sorry...\nI...can't move...anymore...
Radio: I understand.\c\nThen...\nI'll carry out the rest of my plan alone.\c\nWe'll soon see the mothership in the sky...\c\nBut, with only my power, we have no chance.\nI'll get inside the decoy UFO, and when\r\nthe mothership takes it on board,\r\nI'll blow up the decoy UFO and destroy\r\nthe mothership from the inside...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You're crazy!\nIt will never work!
Radio: I know.\nBut it's our only hope.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: But, E, how will you get away?
Radio: If I put the decoy UFO on autopilot,\nit will be shot down easily by convoy UFOs.\c\nI must stay in control of the decoy UFO\nand take it into the mothership myself.\c\n...\c\nFarewell, [VAR 0100(0001)].
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No! E...
And so, E took over [VAR 0100(0001)]'s mission\nand piloted the decoy UFO into the heart\r\nof the mothership.\c\nThe explosion--too distant to be heard...\c\nDebris from the mothership tumbled\nto the ground.\r\n...And all the UFOs vanished from the sky.\c\nWith humanity's battle won, people rejoiced.\c\nBut... Forever absent from the celebration\nwas the mysterious woman...known as E.
Child: Waaaaugh!\nMy Pokémon!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\nI didn't know it was a citizen's Pokémon\r\ncaptured by the UFO...
Child: What have you done!\nYou're from the UFO, aren't you?\r\nHorrible alien!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No! No!\nI didn't mean to!
UFO: ...!!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Argh!
A simple mistake by [VAR 0100(0001)] that\nhurt a citizen's Pokémon...\c\nIn his shock and dismay, he was vulnerable.\nThe UFOs did not hesitate to strike!\c\nWith [VAR 0100(0001)] defeated,\nthe decoy plan failed...\c\nHumanity lost its battle against the UFOs...\c\nAnd the future of humanity reached its\nultimate end...

E: Ah...\nMothership, I'm waiting...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Who are you, E?
E: Foolish human...\nThanks for your help...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You look like...uh...
E: As you can finally see... I am an alien.\nThat's what you humans call us...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: But why did you disguise\nyourself as a human being?
E: Can't you answer your own question?\nI needed your help. I used you.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\nThen, the plan was...
E: The plan was intended to bring\nthe mothership to this planet.\r\nAs you can finally see.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That means...\nThe UFO test we had...?
E: To bring the gigantic mothership to\nthis planet, we needed a lot of energy...\c\nSo I devised a phony UFO test. Ha ha!\nWe absorbed all the energy we needed\r\nfrom your Pokémon!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You...phony...
E: The mothership will soon be landing.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You tricked me!
E: So what?\c\nMy shockingly naive little human being...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wha...?
E: The mothership is our energy source...\c\nSo there's nothing that lower species like\nhumans and Pokémon can do about it anymore.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's over...
E: That's right.\nThis planet will be ours!
E: Now... It's landing...\nThe mothership...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Augh...
E: Our journey will at last be at an end!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What do you mean?
E: Long ago...\c\nOur home planet was completely destroyed\nby a supernova explosion.\c\nFew of us remained.\nWe wandered the vast sea of space...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
E: In our long time wandering, we\nfortunately came upon this planet.\c\nIt meets all the requirements to be\nour new home.\c\nExcept for a small problem...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Problem?
E: Humans and Pokémon!\nThis planet is at maximum capacity already!\c\nTherefore, in order for us to live here,\nwhat is necessary is to eliminate all\r\nhumans and Pokémon. Simple?\c\nSimple.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That sounds awfully like\nyou think you can just invade this planet...
E: ...Invade?\nHumans and Pokémon will be eliminated.\c\nWe aliens, who are superior life-forms,\nwill live here.\r\nWhat's wrong with that?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh, I get you all right...
E: If you understand, then there's no need\nfor you to continue living any longer.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You're making a mistake!
E: Say whatever you want...\c\nIt doesn't matter, because this planet\nwill be remade into an alien paradise...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No! There's another way!
E: It's fine to talk about ideals.\c\nBut can foolish lesser beings like you\nrealize your ideals?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: We humans are awesome!
E: Uh-huh...\nIf you're right about that, then show me.\c\nShow me now.\nThe winner gets to live on this planet...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's over, E.
E: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What's happening?\nThe sky is...shaking!
E: The UFO's defeat made the mothership\ndecide that this planet is dangerous...\c\nWe're condemned to more\nhomeless wandering in space...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, E.\c\nAs you said, this planet is already inhabited\nby a lot of human beings and Pokémon...\c\nBut there's the likelihood that new\nlife-forms will be born in the future, too...
E: So what?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: So...this.\c\nWe don't object to having you aliens, new to\nthis planet, join us and live here together.\c\nBut we do object to your going elsewhere\nand eliminating other life-forms and\r\ntaking over their planet for yourselves.
E: Well, what are you going to do about it?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Humans, Pokémon, and aliens--\nWhy don't we find a way to all live together?
E: I hear you...\nBut your proposal is too late.\c\nWe have to leave this planet\nwith the mothership...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Seriously?
E: We challenged you to battle and lost.\nWe have no regrets.\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], your proposal is interesting.\c\nIt will be something to think about during\nour journey, which will soon begin again...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: E...
The battle for humanity's future was over.\c\nAll UFOs and aliens returned to the\nmothership and left the planet.\c\nRejoicing, everyone cheered and held hands.\c\nBut one person among them all, [VAR 0100(0001)],\nstood gazing up at the starry sky...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oops...\c\nBy any chance, was the Pokémon one\nan alien had stolen from a citizen?
E: Yes.\c\nI was controlling it, but you--\nyou acted with great cruelty.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: N-no! No!\nI didn't mean to!
E: Aha!\nYour emotions have taken hold of you!\c\nThis is the moment I've been waiting for!\nYour weakness is my chance to gain control\r\nof your heart with my psychic energy!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Argggggl!\nArrrrrgh! Stop it!
E: Too late!\c\nFrom now on, your consciousness\nwill be under my control.\c\nYou'll still look like a human being,\nbut you'll work for us... Ha ha!
The battle for humanity's future was over.\c\nUnder alien control, [VAR 0100(0001)] attacked\npeople one after another, until those who\r\ncould challenge the UFOs were vanquished\r\nand human beings and Pokémon were\r\nwiped from the face of the planet.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh... Wha...?\c\nSuddenly...my body...\nSo numb...
E: How are you, [VAR 0100(0001)]?\nCan't you fight anymore?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...\c\nMy eyes...\nEverything is going blank...
E: ...[VAR 0100(0001)].\nAre you having trouble moving?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Aurrrgggl...
E: [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\nYou're quite a superb specimen of a\nhuman being...\c\nIt's a shame to eliminate you along with\nthe other humans and Pokémon...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Auuggh...\nWha...?
E: So I'll make you my subordinate...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?\c\nAughh...\c\nI...refuse...\nI will not...be...your subordinate...
E: Ha. That's what I thought you'd say.\c\nLuckily, I'm not concerned about how you\nfeel or what you think.\c\nYour heart is exhausted from battling.\nI'll just take it over with my\r\npsychic energy...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Augghhh...\c\nArgh!\n...\r\nI...can't...
E: Now--sleep.\c\nWhen you wake, you'll be my subordinate...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
E: Have you fallen asleep yet?\c\nAwww, [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou'll be the last--and only--human\r\nin the world...
The battle for humanity's future had\nreached its ultimate conclusion.\c\nAll humans and Pokémon, defeated\nby the aliens, were loaded into UFOs\r\nto perish in the cold distance of space...\c\nLeaving only one...\n[VAR 0100(0001)]--E's subordinate...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Pant... Pant...\c\nC-can't...move...anymore...
E: You're finished.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Urgh...\c\nWhat are you going to do with\nthe Pokémon and the human beings?
E: I'll capture them all, load them into\nUFOs, and send them into space...\c\nThey'll be the ones wandering hopelessly\nthrough space instead of us.
E: Leaving this planet to be remade\ninto an alien paradise!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Aaaugh!
It was the end of the line. The battle for\nthe future of humanity was complete.\c\nAll humans and Pokémon, defeated\nby the aliens, were loaded into UFOs\r\nto wander the vastness of space...\c\nAnd the world once inhabited by humans\nand Pokémon became an alien paradise...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmm?\nWhat is that strange light...?
Radio: Hey! Can you hear me?\nRespond, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nQuickly, quickly!\nReport the current situation!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Roger!\c\nI confirmed the existence of\na gigantic Tyranitar ahead!\c\nIf it keeps approaching the town,\nit's likely to cause extensive damage!
Radio: Roger, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nFrom now on, we'll call it\r\nTitanic Tyranitar!\c\nListen, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nPrevent the Titanic Tyranitar\r\nfrom entering the town at all costs!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Roger!
Trapped Citizens: Run!\nIf that gigantic Tyranitar attacks us,\r\nwe won't stand a chance!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: As I suspected,\nthis is no ordinary Tyranitar...\c\nI have to stop it,\nbut there's no chance to win\r\nif I go head-to-head with it...\c\nFirst, I should prioritize the\nevacuation of the citizens...
Trapped Citizens: Yeeeek!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Everyone! This way!
Trapped Citizens: Yay!\nThe Unova Defense Force\r\ncame to rescue us!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You! You're in my way!
Trapped Citizens: Yeeeek!\nOh no! Why is this happening?

Titanic Tyranitar: Grrooooo...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What's going on?\nIt won't move. It's just staring at me...\c\nPerhaps it's waiting for me.\nMaybe I should speak to it...
Titanic Tyranitar: Grroooo...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nI'm a member of the Unova Defense Force.\r\nWe protect the peace of Unova!

MT: This was all a test of your skills!\c\nThis MT is a training robot developed\nby the Unova Defense Force!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What??
MT: You were facing a crisis that threatened\nall of Unova, yet you gave up fighting!\c\nDo you still call yourself a member of\nthe Unova Defense Force?!\c\nCome back to HQ as soon as possible!\nWe're starting your training all over again.\r\nI'll train your pitiful guts myself!

The mechanical monster MT\nwas approaching [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nAs the situation grew desperate, the Worker\nwho had escaped came back to help...\c\nHe got into a truck and drove it straight\ninto MT, causing a huge explosion and\r\nblowing smoke!\c\nOnly the immovable body of MT\nwas left behind.\c\nOn unsteady legs, [VAR 0100(0001)] searched\nthe rubble for the heroic Worker,\r\nbut couldn't find him...

Man: Hey, hey! No!\nThat monster isn't mine!\c\nI found an abandoned Poké Ball in the\ncorner of the harbor.\c\nSo I picked it up and threw it.\nThen, that monster came out!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I see...

Radio: A mysterious light?\c\nI can't see anything\nfrom the monitor here!\c\nHave you gotten enough sleep?\nMaybe your eyes are just tired...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Whoa!

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes! I did it!
???: Grrrroooo...\nWell done... Well done...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Now!\c\nAs you promised,\nplease tell me your identity!
???: As you wish.\c\nI am the king of the Titanic Tyranitar,\nwhich you are fighting right now.\c\nMy body no longer exists, so I reluctantly\nborrowed this woman's body to speak to you.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!\c\nSuch a strange story...\nI can't believe it just like that!
???: Grrrroooo...\c\nIt's your choice whether you\nbelieve it or not...\c\nHowever, I don't have anything else\nto say...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\c\nAll right.\nI'll believe you for now...\c\nBut what is your purpose?\nWhat do you hope to accomplish\r\nby testing my power?
???: Grrrroooo...\c\nIf you want to know that, you must\ndefeat us...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I see...\nIf you insist on fighting...\r\nI'll go all out, too!
???: That's reassuring...\c\nWell, my eye for talent may be right...
???: Grrrroooo...\nGreat... [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: How about that,\nTitanic Tyranitar King?\r\nAre you satisfied now?
???: Fine...\nI'll tell you my purpose...\r\nIt's you, [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Me...?
???: ...\nThe mechanical Tyranitar...\r\nYou know about that, don't you...?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Mechanical...\nTyranitar...?\c\nAre you talking about MT?
???: That's correct...\c\nIt is extremely dangerous and\nshouldn't exist in this world...\c\nHowever, there is a villain\nwho's planning bad things\r\nusing the machine...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What...?
???: I've been looking for a strong person\nwho can stop his plan...\c\nAnd I found the person...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]... It is you...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Me... But why?
???: Grrrroooo...\nOur battle just now proved\r\nthe power you possess.\c\nIf we don't stop the mechanical Tyranitar\nand the villain who seeks to control it...\r\na disaster will happen in this world...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nIn the place of this useless old king...\nwill you stop the villain with your power?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...But where in the world is\nthis man you speak of?
???: Grrrroooo...\nOn the night of the next full moon...\r\nHe will appear where he appeared before...\c\nI beg you, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nPlease protect...this world...
After telling me that, the woman who claimed\nto be the Titanic Tyranitar King\r\ndisappeared into the sky...\c\nAnd now it's four days until\nthe next full moon...\c\nWill the villain really appear...?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sigh...\nI'm no match...
???: Grrrroooo...\c\nOh... How disappointing!\nI suppose my eye for talent was wrong...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm disappointed in myself...
???: With your weak power,\nstopping that man is just a dream...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait...\c\nThat man?\n...What are you talking about?
???: Grrrroooo...\c\nYou are weak...\nGo back...\c\nAnd tell your friends...\nLeave this world...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wow! What?!\nMy body is floating!
???: Grrrroooo...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Waaaahhhh!
...\c\nWhen I woke up, I was in a bed in the\nhospital at Unova Defense Force HQ...\c\nI heard I was found by chance\nwhen I was lying on the beach.\c\nI reported my experience to the captain,\nbut he didn't listen to me...\c\nTitanic Tyranitar...the glowing woman...\nWas everything a dream?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff...puff...\nCan't...move...
???: Grrrroooo...\nGrrrroo... Now...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff...puff...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: MT...\nIt really appeared...
Man: Ahem. Who are you?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Excuse me?\nWhat are you doing over there?
Man: My name is Serizawa.\nI am the owner of this land.\c\nWhatever I do here\nis none of your business.\c\nNow, as I asked, who are you?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nI'm a member of the Unova Defense Force.\c\nMr. Serizawa, right?\nIs the MT yours?
Serizawa: The Unova Defense Force...\c\nI see. So you're the one.\nWell, you certainly came in at the right time.\c\nYou interrupted my plans.\nOn top of that, you destroyed my MT.\r\nNow I must return the favor.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!
Serizawa: Muahaha.\c\nToday's machine has been\nspecially prepared just for you.\c\nYou can call it MT2.\c\nIt's been powered up significantly.\nCan you stop it?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey!\nAre you looking for a fight?\c\n(...Could this be the villain that the\nTitanic Tyranitar King warned me about?...)
MT2: Bagoogeeegooon!
Serizawa: Your interference was\nmost unfortunate.\c\nIf that foolish Worker had used MT properly,\nwe could have destroyed the town...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: The MT\nthat appeared before...\r\nThat was also your work?\c\nDestroying the town...\nWhy? What do you gain from that?
Serizawa: Ha. It's simple, really.\c\nI wanted to test MT's power. And I was very\neager to know the limits of what it could do.\r\nTo feel its strength...\c\nWhen you raise a strong Pokémon,\nyou want to make it fight, too, right?\c\nWhat I'm doing is the same thing.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sure, that makes sense.
Serizawa: You understand? Excellent.\nThen, I'll test MT2's power on you as well!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No! It's different!
Serizawa: What's the difference?\c\nThe way I see it, training your Pokémon\nin battle is no different from\r\ntesting the power of my MT.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Uh...
Serizawa: Ha ha ha! What's the matter?\nCan't defend your argument?\c\nDoes that mean you agree with me?
Radio: Can you hear me, [VAR 0100(0001)]?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes!
Radio: The metal that covers MT2's body\nis extremely resistant!\c\nWe can't expect to cause any damage\nwith regular attacks!
Serizawa: Ha ha ha!\nYou'll never defeat me!
Radio: We're analyzing the metal...\nZzt...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], hang in there\nuntil...zzt...zzt...
Serizawa: What did you expect?\c\nI know that you Unova Defense Force\nmeddlers communicate by radio.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: The signal's jammed...
Serizawa: Ha. You see?\nMy MT2 is highly efficient.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What do I do now?
Serizawa: Ha! Sorry, but I play to win.\nAnd my MT2 is made for winning.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sneaky!
Serizawa: Ha! I'll take that as a compliment!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Aaargh!
Serizawa: Come now! You're giving yourself\na bad name.\c\nA member of the Unova Defense Force\nisn't supposed to get emotional, right?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: (...I can't even\ncommunicate with HQ...)\c\n(...What should I do?...)
Serizawa: Ha ha ha...\nWhat will you do now, missy?
???: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nCan you hear me, [VAR 0100(0001)]?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What? Who's that?\nYour voice sounds familiar...
???: It's me...\nThe Titanic Tyranitar King...\c\nI'm using the last of my energy\nto speak directly into your mind...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: !!
Tyranitar King: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nThe machine...MT2...\c\nIt's protecting its weak point\nwith its Ability...\c\nYou must take away its Ability...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Its Ability?
Tyranitar King: I'm counting\non you, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nBecause I cannot...\nyou must protect this world...\c\n...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Titanic Tyranitar King...
Serizawa: Ha! Have you lost your senses?\nYou've started muttering to yourself!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh... Is this the end?
Serizawa: Ha ha ha!\c\nWhat do you think, [VAR 0100(0001)]?\nMy MT2! Isn't it a spectacular machine?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: When it comes to this...\nThe Unova Defense Force...\r\nThe last resort...
Serizawa: Eh? What?\nAre you still planning to do something?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Here I go...\nElectrode... Weezing...\c\nI choose you...
Serizawa: What?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: At all costs...\nI have to stop MT2...
Serizawa: Wait!\c\nWhat are you thinking? Stop!\nStop this at once!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Here we go!\nElectrode!\r\nWeezing!\r\nSimultaneous Explosion!
Serizawa: Stop! I command you! Nooooo!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff...puff...
Serizawa: No more battling!\nWe've had enough!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...\nCould we talk instead?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff... Puff...\nWhat do you mean, talk?
Serizawa: Allow me to explain.\c\nYou have such power. Why limit yourself?\nUsing that strength just for protection...\r\nFrankly, it's a waste of your talent.\c\nWhy don't you come work for me instead?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What are you talking about?\nI'm a member of the Unova Defense Force!
Serizawa: I'll make it worth your while.\c\nWhat's your salary? What does the\nUnova Defense Force pay you?\c\nI'll double it. No, quadruple it.\nNo...I'll go even higher.\r\nI'll pay you 50 times what they do!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-fifty times?!\nBut...but...
Serizawa: That's not enough for you?\c\nFine! One hundred times your current\nsalary. That's my final offer!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: A hundred times what I make\nnow? A hundred! That's so many zeros...\c\nI just don't know if I can accept...
Serizawa: Still not satisfied with\nmy generous offer?\c\nVery well, then. I suppose you'd rather\nbe destroyed by my MT2.\r\nAlong with all your Pokémon.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: N-no, no, I'll take it!\c\nYou've got a deal, Mr. Serizawa!\nOne hundred times my salary, please!
Serizawa: Ha ha ha! Excellent!\nThen we have an agreement.\c\nI have high hopes for you, [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou will go far in my organization.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Serizawa!\nThis is it! Give up!
Serizawa: Arrogant fool! You think\nyou can get the better of me?\c\nI have money to burn!\nI can easily buy a far better MT\r\nthan this old hunk of junk!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What a despicable man...
Serizawa: I'll destroy you\nwith a new MT!\c\nI'll make you regret defying me!\nListen and remember!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait! Wait a minute!
Radio: Hey! Respond!\nRespond, [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes! Chief!
Radio: Finally, I got through!\c\nI've been able to listen to what's going on\nover there but couldn't reach you.\c\nBut from what I've heard, you seem\nto be OK, [VAR 0100(0001)].
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes!\nMT2 is completely shut down.\c\nThe mission is complete!\c\nBut that villain Serizawa, who was\ncontrolling MT2, got away!
Radio: He won't get far. What we heard over\nthe radio proved his wrongdoing.\c\nWe're tracking him down now. He'll soon be\narrested, and all his assets will be\r\nconfiscated. He won't have two coins\r\nto rub together, much less buy a new MT!\c\nGood work, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nReturn to HQ!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Roger!
Titanic Tyranitar King...\nThanks to you, Unova was saved.\c\nYou've been the guardian\nof the Unova region...
MT2: Bagoogeeegooo!
Serizawa: Ha! What is this? Really?\nThat attack was just weak!\c\nDefeating my MT2 is just a dream\nif that's all you can do!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...\nMT2 is a lot tougher than MT...\c\nBut how did he manage to get\nsuch a dangerous machine?\c\nHe didn't develop MT by himself,\ndid he?
Serizawa: Fwa ha ha ha!\nThat's not my area of expertise.\r\nBut I didn't have to create it.\c\nAfter all, my MT isn't the only one...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!
Serizawa: Ah ha ha. Was that not\nwhat you expected?\c\nThese MTs are for sale.\nThere's a whole series of them.\c\nThey're quite popular and quite simple\nto obtain...for those who have the cash.\r\nAnd the connections.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be...\nWho makes them? And why?
Serizawa: Think about it. People can be\nmaniacs about all sorts of things.\c\nThere are destruction maniacs who love\nto destroy things. Me, for instance!\c\nAnd fortunately for me, there are\nmachine maniacs who love to build\r\nwonderfully destructive devices like MT!

Serizawa: Ha ha ha! Excellent!\nThen we have an agreement.\c\nI have high hopes for you, [VAR 0100(0001)].\nYou will go far in my organization.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Serizawa!\nThis is it! Give up!
Serizawa: Arrogant fool! You think\nyou can get the better of me?\c\nI have money to burn!\nI can easily buy a far better MT\r\nthan this old hunk of junk!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What a despicable man...
Serizawa: I'll destroy you\nwith a new MT!\c\nI'll make you regret defying me!\nListen and remember!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait! Wait a minute!
Radio: Hey! Respond!\nRespond, [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes! Chief!
Radio: Finally, I got through!\c\nI've been able to listen to what's going on\nover there but couldn't reach you.\c\nBut from what I've heard, you seem\nto be OK, [VAR 0100(0001)].
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes!\nMT2 is completely shut down.\c\nThe mission is complete!\c\nBut that villain Serizawa, who was\ncontrolling MT2, got away!
Radio: He won't get far. What we heard over\nthe radio proved his wrongdoing.\c\nWe're tracking him down now. He'll soon be\narrested, and all his assets will be\r\nconfiscated. He won't have two coins\r\nto rub together, much less buy a new MT!\c\nGood work, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nReturn to HQ!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Roger!
Titanic Tyranitar King...\nThanks to you, Unova was saved.\c\nYou've been the guardian\nof the Unova region...
MT2: Bagoogeeegooo!
Serizawa: Ha! What is this? Really?\nThat attack was just weak!\c\nDefeating my MT2 is just a dream\nif that's all you can do!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...\nMT2 is a lot tougher than MT...\c\nBut how did he manage to get\nsuch a dangerous machine?\c\nHe didn't develop MT by himself,\ndid he?
Serizawa: Fwa ha ha ha!\nThat's not my area of expertise.\r\nBut I didn't have to create it.\c\nAfter all, my MT isn't the only one...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!
Serizawa: Ah ha ha. Was that not\nwhat you expected?\c\nThese MTs are for sale.\nThere's a whole series of them.\c\nThey're quite popular and quite simple\nto obtain...for those who have the cash.\r\nAnd the connections.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be...\nWho makes them? And why?
Serizawa: Think about it. People can be\nmaniacs about all sorts of things.\c\nThere are destruction maniacs who love\nto destroy things. Me, for instance!\c\nAnd fortunately for me, there are\nmachine maniacs who love to build\r\nwonderfully destructive devices like MT!

Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nPlease be careful!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't believe\nthat the fate of my research is being\r\njeopardized by a pair of glasses!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Still...\nThose are some incredibly flashy glasses...
Strange: That's what makes them great!\nI'm very particular about my glasses!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Argh...\nThis isn't good!
Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nIf this keeps up, the temporal transport\r\nis going to blow!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It's finally time!\nTime to venture into the future with my\r\nnew invention--the temporal transport!
Strange: When you first told me to make\nit small enough to fit inside a capsule the\r\nsize of a person's hand, I thought you\r\nwere asking the impossible, but somehow\r\nwe managed to pull it off!\c\nI've been looking forward to this moment,\nProfessor [VAR 0100(0001)]!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It's time...\nActivate the temporal transport!
Strange: All that's left is to charge\nup the Pokémon move power...\c\nWait! What's this?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What happened?!
Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nI hate to say this, but it appears that\r\nmy glasses are stuck in part of\r\nthe temporal transport!\c\nIf we activate it now, it will\ncertainly malfunction!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Your glasses?!
Strange: Perhaps we could use a Pokémon\nmove to dislodge my glasses...\c\nProfessor [VAR 0100(0001)]! Please try\nto recover my glasses!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Certainly!
Strange: Thank you so much!\nI knew it wouldn't be a problem for you!\c\nPlease get them back. Those glasses are\nvery important to me!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Forget it!
Strange: But Professor, that could\nend up causing serious complications!\c\n...Oh no! They're beginning to throw sparks!\nMy glasses!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Your mistake!
Strange: That may be so, but have some\ncompassion, Professor!\c\nBesides, it's entirely possible that this\nonly happened due to a flaw in your design!\r\nDon't put all the blame on me!\c\n...Oh no! The electricity is shorting out!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I wonder...\nIs the temporal transport OK?
Strange: Temporal transport should\nstill be possible!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Are you sure?\nI'm a little worried about all that smoke\r\ncoming out of it...
Strange: It should be fine!\nThat's just steam from the\r\ncoolant water!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hah!\nSuch minor complications are well within\r\nmy expectations!\c\nContinue the experiment, Strange!
Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nLet's do it! We have the power!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I wonder...\nIs the temporal transport OK?
Strange: I'm getting some very\npeculiar power readings...\r\nThis could be extremely dangerous!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: We should be OK!\nIt wouldn't be an experiment without some\r\nrisk taking! It makes it even more exciting!\c\nThis will surely be an\nelectrifying experience!
Strange: The only thing electrifying is\nthis temporal transport! It's discharging\r\nlike crazy!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I wonder...\nIs the temporal transport OK?
Strange: Hmm...\nIt looks like the temporal transport may\r\nbe overheating. I wouldn't say it's in the\r\nmost stable condition...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: So what?\nNo risk, no reward! I'm burning\r\nwith excitement!
Strange: That's all well and good, but\nwhat will we do if the temporal transport\r\ncatches on fire?
Strange: We've done it, Professor!\nThe temporal transport is functioning\r\nproperly! And my glasses are safe and\r\nsound, too!\c\nIn just moments, a gate into the future\nwill open before us!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Excellent!\c\nThen I will be on my way to visit\nthe world of the future!\c\nI'll bring you a souvenir!\nExpect something cool!
Strange: I will!\c\nPlease, return safely, Professor!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Soon now...\c\nTemporal transport activation...go!
Strange: Good luck,\nProfessor [VAR 0100(0001)]!
And thus, I ventured into the world\nof the future with the time machine\r\nI invented myself--the temporal transport!\c\nBut...\c\nAs I look back on these events,\nI wonder if it might have been better\r\nif my experiment had failed...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's this?
Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThe temporal transport system is\r\nout of control!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Could my\nexperiment have failed?
Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nGet away from the temporal transport!\r\nIt's going to explode!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Aaahhh!
Strange: Professor!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...argh...
Strange: Professor! Professor!\nAre you OK?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Urghh...\nI can't believe I made it through...\r\nWe'll have to start all over now...
Strange: Uhh...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\nWhat's the matter?\c\nCan't you see? I'm just fine!\nAnnoyed that the experiment failed, but fine\r\nall the same. I won't give up so easily!
Strange: Umm... Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nYou'd better have a look at this...
When I gazed into the mirror Strange\nhanded me, I was at a loss for words...\c\nThere in the mirror, I saw...not myself,\nbut a very peculiar creature instead.\c\nPerhaps it was a side effect of the energy\nthat leaked out of the temporal transport,\r\nbut I had somehow become merged with\r\nmy [VAR 0102(0000)], who had been at my side.\c\nThis, of course, marked the end\nof my research...
Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThe energy will not stop discharging!\c\n...Wait! What's happening?\c\nThe temporal transport appears to be\nfunctioning properly...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: You worry too much!\nIf the temporal transport is functioning,\r\nthen there isn't a problem!\c\nAnd now it's time for me to venture\ninto the world of the future!\c\nOff I go!
Strange: But, Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nPlease, wait a moment!\c\nIt can't be! I'm detecting an eruption of\ntachyon particles!\c\nProfessor! You must stop!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I care not!\c\nTemporal-transport activation...go!
Strange: Professor, no!\nProfess...or! Stop...now...\c\n...
Ignoring my assistant's pleas, I stepped\ninto the gate, not knowing how soon I would\r\ncome to regret it...\c\nIt was just as Strange said. The\ntemporal transport was not functioning\r\nproperly. Instead of stepping into the\r\nfuture, I was warped 100 million years\r\ninto the past...
Not only that, but with the temporal\ntransport broken down, and with no means\r\nto fix it in these ancient times, I am stuck\r\nforever in the past, unable to return...\c\nMaybe it's not so bad to live in a world\nwhere I can see ancient Pokémon, the likes\r\nof which I had only seen in Fossil museums...\r\nAt least, that's what I keep telling myself.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...\nI guess it just won't work...\c\nHow unfortunate. I heard this move could\ntranscend time.
Strange: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nTrying to bend time and space with a\nPokémon move instead of using the temporal\r\ntransport is just shameful! That's not\r\nhow a proper scientist should behave!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: You think so?\nI kind of hoped it would work...
Strange: Seriously?\nUgh... Just do whatever you want...

Future Being
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Could this be...\c\n(...Is this the future?...)
Ledian: Hmm... What's this?\nYou're a strange-looking Human.\c\nYou look kind of like a Scientist, but\nI've never seen your type before.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It's a person...\nI'd better try not to do too much damage...
Ledian: That dumb Human is holding back.\nIt doesn't want to hurt another of its\r\nown kind.\c\nHmph. Such a common trait among\nthe weaker species. How foolish.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Are you telling\nme you don't care?\c\nYou wouldn't mind hurting another Pokémon?
Ledian: How could you obey a Human\nlike that? Such disgraceful Pokémon!\r\nI'll eliminate you all!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't need\nto defeat the people you're controlling\r\nto protect my Pokémon!
Ledian: That's enough talk from you!\c\nIs that the Scientist Ability?\nRunning your mouth?
Ledian: Stop right there, Human!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: A Pokémon?!
Ledian: It's not often that we get\nwild Humans showing up in town...\c\nThey're dangerous and need to be\neliminated quickly!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: A talking Pokémon?\nDid it just release a person from that Ball?!\c\nWhat's going on here?\c\nIt's like everything is backward!
Ledian: Huh?\nHumans using Pokémon?\r\nWhat is this madness?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait!\nTell me what's going on here!
Ledian: What's going on?\c\nHere's how things work here: you lowly\nHumans go into these Human Balls, and then\r\nyou do as your Trainer Pokémon commands!\c\nWild Humans who won't go into the Balls\nare to be eliminated! It's simple!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\nIn the world of the future, Pokémon\r\ncatch people?!
Ledian: The future? Are you trying to tell\nme that you come from the past?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Well...\c\n(...Should I tell this Pokémon about\nhow I traveled through time?\r\nIt probably won't believe me...)
Ledian: Or are you just a dirty lying Human?\c\nLying is cowardice! Cowardice is a crime!\nYou must be eliminated!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Help!
Ledian: Begging for your life, are you?\nWhat a pathetic Human! I think I'll take\r\nmy time eliminating you!\c\nCome out, Black Belt! Teach this\ncowardly Human a lesson!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Can we talk?
Ledian: Talk? Why should a Pokémon\ntalk to a pathetic Human like you?\r\nHow ridiculous!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm not lying!
Ledian: How could that be true?\nYou must be lying. Lying is a crime.\r\nCriminals must be eliminated.\r\nBlack Belt, take care of this liar!
Ledian: What's wrong, Human?\nYou can't even fight back?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't want\nto fight! Stop this!
Ledian: If you don't want to fight,\nyou'd better release that [VAR 0102(0000)]!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't do that...
Ledian: I didn't think so!\c\nHumans are so weak. You've only got\ntwo arms, and you can't even fly!\c\nPokémon must make great bodyguards\nfor you Humans. Or do you treat them\r\nmore like tools for your own convenience?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not true!\nPokémon are my friends!
Ledian: A likely story.\c\nAnyway, Humans like you are simply tools\nfor us Pokémon.\c\nYou're just toys who battle each other for\nour enjoyment! It doesn't matter if you\r\nbreak--there are plenty of replacements!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's terrible...
Black Belt: You...\nHuman who use Pokémon...\r\nYou understand me?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: You can speak?
Black Belt: Stuck in Ball...\nTreated like thing...\c\nNot talk ever. Not talk good.\nBut must talk you...\c\nYou say you from past.\nI believe.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you...\nI appreciate it!
Black Belt: Long ago. Bug Pokémon get\nstrong. Evolution Stone make strong.\r\nThey take over.\r\nE-lim-i-nate many human...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!\nWhat's an Evolution Stone?
Black Belt: Evolution Stone...\nMake Bug Pokémon very smart...\r\nPokémon strong and smart...\r\nNo chance for human...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I never\nimagined the future could be like this...
Ledian: Black Belt! Silence!\nStop yapping with that other Human!\c\nYou're nothing more than a tool!\nDo as I say or face the consequences!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm only telling\nthe truth! Please, believe me!
Ledian: Even with the superior technology\nof the Bug-type Pokémon, we haven't been\r\nable to achieve time travel. There's no way\r\na mere Human could have done so!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: But I did! I came\nhere on a time machine of my own invention!
Ledian: You're just lying to save yourself.\nIt's rare to see a Human as clever as you.\r\nThat makes you dangerous.\c\nI'd better eliminate you for good measure!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not fair!
Ledian: Come on, Black Belt!\nHurry up and eliminate this scum.\c\nI'm done wasting my time talking to\nthis dirty Human!
Ledian: How did you do that?!\nYou protected your Pokémon without\r\nhurting my Black Belt!\c\nHmm...\c\nInteresting. You are an unusual Human.\nOK, I'll spare you from elimination.\r\nI'll also believe your wild story.\c\nBut first...\c\nSit still and let me catch you!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: No!\nWhat's this? Some kind of string?\c\nGet it off me! Untie this string now!\nLet me go!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ack!\nThe more I try to break free, the more\r\nstuck I get...\c\nThe powerful sticky string of a\nBug-type Pokémon...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Please!\nI don't mean to harm any of you!\r\nYou've had your fun!\r\nI just want to get back to my own time!
Ledian: You think so?\c\nUnfortunately for you, I'll be the\njudge of when I've had my fun...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What more\ndo you want from me?
Ledian: Hee hee hee...\c\n(...We couldn't make a time machine with\nour own technology, but if I could get my\r\nappendages on this Human's time machine,\r\nI'd be a hero...)
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Come on!\nSay something!
Ledian: OK, then...\c\n(...If I can capture Humans from all the\ndifferent eras, we Bug-type Pokémon will\r\nprosper even more...)
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Stop!\nGet away from my Bag!
Ledian: What's all this junk?\nDirt and rocks... Plant seeds...\r\nIt's just a bunch of garbage!\c\nHmm... What's this?\nLooks like a Human Ball.\c\nSomething's different, though...\c\nI've got it! Could this be...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\nNot the temporal transport...
Ledian: Bingo! So, this is your time machine.\nTemporal transport, you called it?\c\nImpressive to have fit it into a capsule\nthis small...
And so Ledian captured me and seized\nmy temporal transport.\c\nHowever, I would not give up so easily.\nNot while I still needed to deliver these\r\nprecious research samples back to my own\r\ntime... I had to keep fighting.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Argh... Urgh...
Ledian: Stupid, pathetic, helpless Human...\nI'm starting to feel sorry for you, so I'll\r\nlet you go...\c\nEntertain me by scampering away like the\ncowardly fool you are.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Eeek!
Ledian: Constantly eliminating Humans\nlike you gets old after a while...\c\nSo I need to mix things up for a change of\npace, or else I'd get bored with my toys!
Somehow, I made it away with my life.\nAfterward, I had to lie low by hiding inside\r\ncaves and patches of tall grass in order to\r\navoid the gaze of Pokémon who aimed to\r\ndefeat or capture humans like me...
Sometimes I stop to think about the\nPokémon of my own time...how they must\r\nfeel if they don't want to be caught...\c\nI'm in a constant state of fear and\nunease, with never a moment's rest.\r\nThis life is only pain and struggle...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ack! I went too far!
Ledian: What's this?\nYou've broken my Black Belt!\c\nOh well, no great loss... I'll just have\nto go catch another Human...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh... Oh no...\nIt was an accident!\r\nHow could I have done such a thing\r\nto a fellow human...
Ledian: You toys break too easily.\nHey, I know! I'll just catch you\r\nto replace that one! Human Ball, go!
I passed out from the shock of defeating\na fellow human. Ledian caught me, and\r\nI became one of her Humans.\c\nAnd then...
Ledian: [VAR 0100(0001)], I choose you!\nHurry up and eliminate that Human!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Groaarr!
Ledian: Good job, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nHee hee hee... You've grown quite\nstrong, indeed!\r\nI'll treat you to a special grooming today!
Ledian could be very cruel, but she also\ncould be nice to Humans who pleased her.\c\nOver time, I gradually became more and\nmore loyal to Ledian...to the point that\r\nI would do anything to assist her...
A world where Humans are used and\ncontrolled by Pokémon...\c\nIf this is the reality of the future,\nI have no choice but to accept it.\c\nSometimes I wonder what became of\n[VAR 0102(0000)], who was my Pokémon\r\nin our own time...\c\nAre you out there having grand adventures\nas a Trainer Pokémon?

Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Could this be...\c\n(...Is this the future?...)
Ledian: Hmm... What's this?\nYou're a strange-looking Human.\c\nYou look kind of like a Scientist, but\nI've never seen your type before.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It's a person...\nI'd better try not to do too much damage...
Ledian: That dumb Human is holding back.\nIt doesn't want to hurt another of its\r\nown kind.\c\nHmph. Such a common trait among\nthe weaker species. How foolish.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Are you telling\nme you don't care?\c\nYou wouldn't mind hurting another Pokémon?
Ledian: How could you obey a Human\nlike that? Such disgraceful Pokémon!\r\nI'll eliminate you all!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't need\nto defeat the people you're controlling\r\nto protect my Pokémon!
Ledian: That's enough talk from you!\c\nIs that the Scientist Ability?\nRunning your mouth?
Ledian: Stop right there, Human!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: A Pokémon?!
Ledian: It's not often that we get\nwild Humans showing up in town...\c\nThey're dangerous and need to be\neliminated quickly!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: A talking Pokémon?\nDid it just release a person from that Ball?!\c\nWhat's going on here?\c\nIt's like everything is backward!
Ledian: Huh?\nHumans using Pokémon?\r\nWhat is this madness?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait!\nTell me what's going on here!
Ledian: What's going on?\c\nHere's how things work here: you lowly\nHumans go into these Human Balls, and then\r\nyou do as your Trainer Pokémon commands!\c\nWild Humans who won't go into the Balls\nare to be eliminated! It's simple!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\nIn the world of the future, Pokémon\r\ncatch people?!
Ledian: The future? Are you trying to tell\nme that you come from the past?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Well...\c\n(...Should I tell this Pokémon about\nhow I traveled through time?\r\nIt probably won't believe me...)
Ledian: Or are you just a dirty lying Human?\c\nLying is cowardice! Cowardice is a crime!\nYou must be eliminated!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Help!
Ledian: Begging for your life, are you?\nWhat a pathetic Human! I think I'll take\r\nmy time eliminating you!\c\nCome out, Black Belt! Teach this\ncowardly Human a lesson!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Can we talk?
Ledian: Talk? Why should a Pokémon\ntalk to a pathetic Human like you?\r\nHow ridiculous!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm not lying!
Ledian: How could that be true?\nYou must be lying. Lying is a crime.\r\nCriminals must be eliminated.\r\nBlack Belt, take care of this liar!
Ledian: What's wrong, Human?\nYou can't even fight back?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't want\nto fight! Stop this!
Ledian: If you don't want to fight,\nyou'd better release that [VAR 0102(0000)]!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't do that...
Ledian: I didn't think so!\c\nHumans are so weak. You've only got\ntwo arms, and you can't even fly!\c\nPokémon must make great bodyguards\nfor you Humans. Or do you treat them\r\nmore like tools for your own convenience?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not true!\nPokémon are my friends!
Ledian: A likely story.\c\nAnyway, Humans like you are simply tools\nfor us Pokémon.\c\nYou're just toys who battle each other for\nour enjoyment! It doesn't matter if you\r\nbreak--there are plenty of replacements!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's terrible...
Black Belt: You...\nHuman who use Pokémon...\r\nYou understand me?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: You can speak?
Black Belt: Stuck in Ball...\nTreated like thing...\c\nNot talk ever. Not talk good.\nBut must talk you...\c\nYou say you from past.\nI believe.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you...\nI appreciate it!
Black Belt: Long ago. Bug Pokémon get\nstrong. Evolution Stone make strong.\r\nThey take over.\r\nE-lim-i-nate many human...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!\nWhat's an Evolution Stone?
Black Belt: Evolution Stone...\nMake Bug Pokémon very smart...\r\nPokémon strong and smart...\r\nNo chance for human...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I never\nimagined the future could be like this...
Ledian: Black Belt! Silence!\nStop yapping with that other Human!\c\nYou're nothing more than a tool!\nDo as I say or face the consequences!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm only telling\nthe truth! Please, believe me!
Ledian: Even with the superior technology\nof the Bug-type Pokémon, we haven't been\r\nable to achieve time travel. There's no way\r\na mere Human could have done so!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: But I did! I came\nhere on a time machine of my own invention!
Ledian: You're just lying to save yourself.\nIt's rare to see a Human as clever as you.\r\nThat makes you dangerous.\c\nI'd better eliminate you for good measure!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not fair!
Ledian: Come on, Black Belt!\nHurry up and eliminate this scum.\c\nI'm done wasting my time talking to\nthis dirty Human!
Ledian: How did you do that?!\nYou protected your Pokémon without\r\nhurting my Black Belt!\c\nHmm...\c\nInteresting. You are an unusual Human.\nOK, I'll spare you from elimination.\r\nI'll also believe your wild story.\c\nBut first...\c\nSit still and let me catch you!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: No!\nWhat's this? Some kind of string?\c\nGet it off me! Untie this string now!\nLet me go!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ack!\nThe more I try to break free, the more\r\nstuck I get...\c\nThe powerful sticky string of a\nBug-type Pokémon...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Please!\nI don't mean to harm any of you!\r\nYou've had your fun!\r\nI just want to get back to my own time!
Ledian: You think so?\c\nUnfortunately for you, I'll be the\njudge of when I've had my fun...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What more\ndo you want from me?
Ledian: Hee hee hee...\c\n(...We couldn't make a time machine with\nour own technology, but if I could get my\r\nappendages on this Human's time machine,\r\nI'd be a hero...)
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Come on!\nSay something!
Ledian: OK, then...\c\n(...If I can capture Humans from all the\ndifferent eras, we Bug-type Pokémon will\r\nprosper even more...)
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Stop!\nGet away from my Bag!
Ledian: What's all this junk?\nDirt and rocks... Plant seeds...\r\nIt's just a bunch of garbage!\c\nHmm... What's this?\nLooks like a Human Ball.\c\nSomething's different, though...\c\nI've got it! Could this be...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\nNot the temporal transport...
Ledian: Bingo! So, this is your time machine.\nTemporal transport, you called it?\c\nImpressive to have fit it into a capsule\nthis small...
And so Ledian captured me and seized\nmy temporal transport.\c\nHowever, I would not give up so easily.\nNot while I still needed to deliver these\r\nprecious research samples back to my own\r\ntime... I had to keep fighting.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Argh... Urgh...

Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It's not easy to\ngo back to the past from the future.\c\nIt takes a lot more energy than it does\nto come from the past into the future...

Black Belt: Temporal transport...\nLook likes a Human Ball?\c\nLedian has it...\nMakes me go back to Ball...\r\nThen, temporal transport comes out...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Black Belt, thank\nyou. I feel like I understand.
Ledian: Black Belt... Are you so worthless\na human that you can't follow even the most\r\nbasic of orders?\c\nWorthlessness is a crime...\nI'll eliminate you all...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll show you what\nhumans are really made of...
Ledian: I don't understand.\c\nThe existence of you humans is only\nvalidated when you're used by us\r\nBug-type Pokémon.\c\nYou can't do anything on your own.\nSuch an immature life-form...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: We may not be\nstrong on our own, but that's why we\r\nhelp each other out.\c\nI have my assistant, Strange, as well\nas [VAR 0102(0000)]...\r\nI also have the help of Black Belt!
Ledian: Silence!\c\nYou can't even fly into the sky\nor spin a string!\r\nYou can't shoot powerful beams\r\nor evolve into stronger forms!\r\nAnd you've only got two arms...
Ledian: Just who do you think you are\nanyway? You think it's OK to come into\r\nthe future like this and just go back home?\c\nYou think it's OK to come into our world,\ntake whatever you please, and then return\r\nto your own era at your own convenience?\r\nI don't think so!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: But...
Ledian: Or perhaps you thought that\nthe future would be an even better place\r\nfor you humans?\c\nIt's only because of humans in the past like\nyou, who did whatever they pleased, that\r\nthis world turned out like it did...\c\nIdiotic humans... How can you be so naive?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: No! It's not true...
Ledian: Hmph...\c\nNo matter... Us Bug-type Pokémon are\nthankful for the mistakes you humans made.\c\nIt's all thanks to you that we came to\ncontrol the future!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: All your fault!
Ledian: There you go again...\nAlways blaming other people for your\r\nown mistakes...\r\nI'm not a person, though...\c\n...\c\nOuch! That hurts!\c\nWhat's going on?\nWhat is this powerful energy coming out\r\nof the capsule your time machine is in?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: You're wrong!
Ledian: You humans are all the same...\c\nAlways averting your gaze from reality\nwhen it's not convenient...\r\nAlways denying what you know is true...\c\n...\c\nOuch! It's so cold!\c\nWhat's going on?\nSome strange coolant gas is seeping out\r\nof the capsule your time machine is in...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll change it!
Ledian: Hah!\nAs if you could...\c\nOf course you can't...\c\n...Wait a second. You managed to create a\ntime machine when even us Bug-type Pokémon\r\ncouldn't... Could it be possible that you\r\nhave the power to change the future?\c\n...\c\nOuch! That's hot!\c\nWhat's going on?\nThis capsule that your time machine is in\r\nis starting to heat up...
Ledian: It's so bright...\nIt's burning my eyes...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\nIf the energy keeps pouring out of my\r\ntemporal transport like this,\r\nit might explode!
Ledian: What?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: After storing up\nso much energy, if my temporal transport\r\nwere to explode now, it could quite possibly\r\nbend space and time and create a black hole!
Ledian: A black hole?!\nYou mean a mass of gravity that swallows\r\nup everything?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: This is bad...
Ledian: Now I get it...\c\nA dangerous invention like this is only to\nbe expected of you barbarian humans!\c\nBug-type Pokémon would never think to\ncreate such a perilous device!\c\nThis is a terrible weapon, made to\nannihilate us Bug-type Pokémon!\r\nIt was your goal all along to eliminate\r\nus all, wasn't it?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...\nThis coolant liquid is extremely powerful...
Ledian: Cold... So cold...\nI'm not good against ice...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: There's a good\nchance that it will spread until it engulfs\r\nthe entire world, ushering in a new ice age!
Ledian: An ice age...\nUs Bug-type Pokémon wouldn't survive...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: This is bad...
Ledian: Now I get it...\c\nA dangerous invention like this is only to\nbe expected of you barbarian humans!\c\nBug-type Pokémon would never think to\ncreate such a perilous device!\c\nThis is a terrible weapon, made to\nannihilate us Bug-type Pokémon!\r\nIt was your goal all along to eliminate\r\nus all, wasn't it?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It'll be OK!\nMy temporal transport is highly resistant\r\nto heat!
Ledian: Just like a Scientist to get all\nexcited whenever you talk about\r\nsomething scientific...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmph...\nI'm the brilliant scientist who invented\r\nthis temporal transport!\c\nA small complication such as this is well\nwithin expectations!
Ledian: It's as if you entered your own\nworld... What incredible concentration...\c\nAnother common trait of you Scientists...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll show you\nI can change history!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: OK! It's charged\nup enough energy now!\c\nI should be able to go back to the past!
Ledian: So you tricked me into bringing out\nthe temporal transport so you could charge\r\nit with lightning...\c\n...Impressive, I must say. You may have\nonly two arms, but you're pretty good...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ledian...\nYou may have been right. I was selfish to\r\nhave come into the future like this...\c\nIt was only in the interest of science that\nI came to this era. I apologize if I've made\r\na mess of things here...\c\nHere! I'll give you these items back.
Ledian: What is this?\nSome dirt...rocks...plant seeds?\r\nIt's a bunch of junk...\c\n...\c\nWhat's this?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's wrong?
Ledian: ...Do you know what this is?\nYou just saved your life, human...\c\n...No, you just saved the lives of all\nhumans--past, present, and future...\r\nHow impressive...\c\n...This is the stone that allowed us\nBug-type Pokémon to revolt against\r\nyou humans...\c\nThat's right...\nThis is the Evolution Stone...\c\nIf you go back to your era without it,\neverything will change...
...And so I was able to safely return\nto my own era...\c\n...If I hadn't returned my research\nsamples to Ledian before coming back,\r\nthen I would have brought back the\r\nEvolution Stone, which would have caused\r\nthe Bug-type Pokémon of my era to evolve at\r\na rapid pace, and they would have\r\neventually revolted against us humans...
...I never would have thought that I would\nhave been responsible for changing the\r\nfate of the human race...\c\n...It still remains to be seen whether\nchanging the future like I did was indeed\r\na good thing, though...
...However, before I changed the future,\nLedian looked down on all other life-forms\r\nand lived all alone...\c\n...I hope that in the future that I brought\nabout, Ledian will at least feel a little\r\nless lonely.\c\nThat's all that I can really do\nright now...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm not sure\nexactly why, but it looks like I might be\r\nable to use the temporal transport now...
Ledian: Stop right there! I won't let you\nget away! I will eliminate you!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ha ha ha!\nFarewell, Ledian!\c\nI've got the research samples that I came\nfor, so there's no reason for me to stick\r\naround here any longer!\c\nI'm going back home to my own era to\nlive in peace!
Ledian: Mwa ha ha ha...\nYou fell right into my trap!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!
Ledian: I realized that you carry the\nEvolution Stone in your bag, so I decided\r\nto let you go...\c\nI'm sure I don't have to tell you what will\nhappen to the Pokémon of your era if you\r\nbring the Evolution Stone back...\c\nBon voyage, foolish Human...\c\nI'll be waiting for you here, in the world\nafter the Pokémon revolt...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be so!\c\nOh no... It's no good...\nI can't stop the temporal transport!\c\nNo! I don't want to go back like this!\nIf I go back now, the revolt will occur!
Ledian: You were such a foolish, foolish\nhuman... Not to mention such a fun toy\r\nto play with...\c\nFor a pathetic human with only two arms, you\nsure provided me with much entertainment!
...And so I was able to return safely\nto my own era...\c\n...However, it was because of my safe\nreturn that the world changed forever...\c\n...The effects of the Evolution Stone were\nquick. The Bug-type Pokémon soon\r\ntransformed into terrible overlords who\r\nreigned over us.\c\nSoon, we normal humans became a different\nkind of human--their playthings...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's this?\nThese energy readings coming from the\r\ntemporal transport shouldn't be possible!\r\nThey're exceeding the limit!
Ledian: What's going to happen?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hrmm?\nOh... Oh no!
Ledian: What?!
...I surveyed my surroundings after\nregaining consciousness, but I couldn't\r\nbelieve what lay before me...\c\n...For as far as the eye could see was\nnothing but machinery...\c\nEntire cities made of machines, inhabited\nby humans and their heartless robot\r\nmasters, who treated them like common parts\r\nof a great machine, discarding and replacing\r\nthem as needed...
...I had come even further into the future,\nbut it was even worse than the era in which\r\nBug-type Pokémon reigned supreme...\c\nIn this future, robots ruled over all living\nbeings and used them as simple tools...\c\nI couldn't believe it. I felt my head spin,\nand I collapsed right then and there...\c\n...As my consciousness began to fade away,\nI could see one of the robots approaching.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...\nI guess it just won't work...\c\nHow unfortunate. I heard this move could\ntranscend time.
Ledian: What are you doing?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's that?\nOh, I just thought it would be nice if I\r\ncould bend time using a Pokémon move...
Ledian: Of all the idiotic things...\nDid you really invent this time machine?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's different!
Ledian: Ugh... Why am I wasting my time\nwith this dumb human?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!\nCut me some slack...\r\nIt was worth a try!
Ledian: Whatever... At least you're dense\nenough to provide some entertainment.\c\nI guess it's better than being alone...

Ledian: Hmph...\c\nNo matter... Us Bug-type Pokémon are\nthankful for the mistakes you humans made.\c\nIt's all thanks to you that we came to\ncontrol the future!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: All your fault!
Ledian: There you go again...\nAlways blaming other people for your\r\nown mistakes...\r\nI'm not a person, though...\c\n...\c\nOuch! That hurts!\c\nWhat's going on?\nWhat is this powerful energy coming out\r\nof the capsule your time machine is in?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: You're wrong!
Ledian: You humans are all the same...\c\nAlways averting your gaze from reality\nwhen it's not convenient...\r\nAlways denying what you know is true...\c\n...\c\nOuch! It's so cold!\c\nWhat's going on?\nSome strange coolant gas is seeping out\r\nof the capsule your time machine is in...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll change it!
Ledian: Hah!\nAs if you could...\c\nOf course you can't...\c\n...Wait a second. You managed to create a\ntime machine when even us Bug-type Pokémon\r\ncouldn't... Could it be possible that you\r\nhave the power to change the future?\c\n...\c\nOuch! That's hot!\c\nWhat's going on?\nThis capsule that your time machine is in\r\nis starting to heat up...
Ledian: It's so bright...\nIt's burning my eyes...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\nIf the energy keeps pouring out of my\r\ntemporal transport like this,\r\nit might explode!
Ledian: What?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: After storing up\nso much energy, if my temporal transport\r\nwere to explode now, it could quite possibly\r\nbend space and time and create a black hole!
Ledian: A black hole?!\nYou mean a mass of gravity that swallows\r\nup everything?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: This is bad...
Ledian: Now I get it...\c\nA dangerous invention like this is only to\nbe expected of you barbarian humans!\c\nBug-type Pokémon would never think to\ncreate such a perilous device!\c\nThis is a terrible weapon, made to\nannihilate us Bug-type Pokémon!\r\nIt was your goal all along to eliminate\r\nus all, wasn't it?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...\nThis coolant liquid is extremely powerful...
Ledian: Cold... So cold...\nI'm not good against ice...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: There's a good\nchance that it will spread until it engulfs\r\nthe entire world, ushering in a new ice age!
Ledian: An ice age...\nUs Bug-type Pokémon wouldn't survive...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: This is bad...
Ledian: Now I get it...\c\nA dangerous invention like this is only to\nbe expected of you barbarian humans!\c\nBug-type Pokémon would never think to\ncreate such a perilous device!\c\nThis is a terrible weapon, made to\nannihilate us Bug-type Pokémon!\r\nIt was your goal all along to eliminate\r\nus all, wasn't it?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It'll be OK!\nMy temporal transport is highly resistant\r\nto heat!
Ledian: Just like a Scientist to get all\nexcited whenever you talk about\r\nsomething scientific...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmph...\nI'm the brilliant scientist who invented\r\nthis temporal transport!\c\nA small complication such as this is well\nwithin expectations!
Ledian: It's as if you entered your own\nworld... What incredible concentration...\c\nAnother common trait of you Scientists...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll show you\nI can change history!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: OK! It's charged\nup enough energy now!\c\nI should be able to go back to the past!
Ledian: So you tricked me into bringing out\nthe temporal transport so you could charge\r\nit with lightning...\c\n...Impressive, I must say. You may have\nonly two arms, but you're pretty good...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ledian...\nYou may have been right. I was selfish to\r\nhave come into the future like this...\c\nIt was only in the interest of science that\nI came to this era. I apologize if I've made\r\na mess of things here...\c\nHere! I'll give you these items back.
Ledian: What is this?\nSome dirt...rocks...plant seeds?\r\nIt's a bunch of junk...\c\n...\c\nWhat's this?!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's wrong?
Ledian: ...Do you know what this is?\nYou just saved your life, human...\c\n...No, you just saved the lives of all\nhumans--past, present, and future...\r\nHow impressive...\c\n...This is the stone that allowed us\nBug-type Pokémon to revolt against\r\nyou humans...\c\nThat's right...\nThis is the Evolution Stone...\c\nIf you go back to your era without it,\neverything will change...
...And so I was able to safely return\nto my own era...\c\n...If I hadn't returned my research\nsamples to Ledian before coming back,\r\nthen I would have brought back the\r\nEvolution Stone, which would have caused\r\nthe Bug-type Pokémon of my era to evolve at\r\na rapid pace, and they would have\r\neventually revolted against us humans...
...I never would have thought that I would\nhave been responsible for changing the\r\nfate of the human race...\c\n...It still remains to be seen whether\nchanging the future like I did was indeed\r\na good thing, though...
...However, before I changed the future,\nLedian looked down on all other life-forms\r\nand lived all alone...\c\n...I hope that in the future that I brought\nabout, Ledian will at least feel a little\r\nless lonely.\c\nThat's all that I can really do\nright now...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm not sure\nexactly why, but it looks like I might be\r\nable to use the temporal transport now...
Ledian: Stop right there! I won't let you\nget away! I will eliminate you!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ha ha ha!\nFarewell, Ledian!\c\nI've got the research samples that I came\nfor, so there's no reason for me to stick\r\naround here any longer!\c\nI'm going back home to my own era to\nlive in peace!
Ledian: Mwa ha ha ha...\nYou fell right into my trap!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!
Ledian: I realized that you carry the\nEvolution Stone in your bag, so I decided\r\nto let you go...\c\nI'm sure I don't have to tell you what will\nhappen to the Pokémon of your era if you\r\nbring the Evolution Stone back...\c\nBon voyage, foolish Human...\c\nI'll be waiting for you here, in the world\nafter the Pokémon revolt...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be so!\c\nOh no... It's no good...\nI can't stop the temporal transport!\c\nNo! I don't want to go back like this!\nIf I go back now, the revolt will occur!
Ledian: You were such a foolish, foolish\nhuman... Not to mention such a fun toy\r\nto play with...\c\nFor a pathetic human with only two arms, you\nsure provided me with much entertainment!
...And so I was able to return safely\nto my own era...\c\n...However, it was because of my safe\nreturn that the world changed forever...\c\n...The effects of the Evolution Stone were\nquick. The Bug-type Pokémon soon\r\ntransformed into terrible overlords who\r\nreigned over us.\c\nSoon, we normal humans became a different\nkind of human--their playthings...
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's this?\nThese energy readings coming from the\r\ntemporal transport shouldn't be possible!\r\nThey're exceeding the limit!
Ledian: What's going to happen?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hrmm?\nOh... Oh no!
Ledian: What?!
...I surveyed my surroundings after\nregaining consciousness, but I couldn't\r\nbelieve what lay before me...\c\n...For as far as the eye could see was\nnothing but machinery...\c\nEntire cities made of machines, inhabited\nby humans and their heartless robot\r\nmasters, who treated them like common parts\r\nof a great machine, discarding and replacing\r\nthem as needed...
...I had come even further into the future,\nbut it was even worse than the era in which\r\nBug-type Pokémon reigned supreme...\c\nIn this future, robots ruled over all living\nbeings and used them as simple tools...\c\nI couldn't believe it. I felt my head spin,\nand I collapsed right then and there...\c\n...As my consciousness began to fade away,\nI could see one of the robots approaching.
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...\nI guess it just won't work...\c\nHow unfortunate. I heard this move could\ntranscend time.
Ledian: What are you doing?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's that?\nOh, I just thought it would be nice if I\r\ncould bend time using a Pokémon move...
Ledian: Of all the idiotic things...\nDid you really invent this time machine?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's different!
Ledian: Ugh... Why am I wasting my time\nwith this dumb human?
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!\nCut me some slack...\r\nIt was worth a try!
Ledian: Whatever... At least you're dense\nenough to provide some entertainment.\c\nI guess it's better than being alone...

Miguel: Ha ha... I guess it is...\c\n(...Hey! Smeargle!! Don't butt in!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Shall we?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Take it easy on me...
Miguel: I should ask you to\ntake it easy on me as well!\c\n(...She has to be younger,\nbut she's such an elegant lady!...)\c\n(...Oh... Wow... This is too much.\nThat makes her even more my type!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Prepare yourself!
Miguel: Ha ha ha...\nYou're quite confident in your abilities.\c\n(...Saying something like that\nto me, an Ace Trainer...)\c\n(...That's kinda arrogant, but\nthat aggressiveness is cute, too...)

Miguel: Hmph... If you can!\c\n(...Listen up, Smeargle!\nNo funny business!...)\c\n(...For now, we're just going\nto watch how she battles!...)

[VAR 0100(0001)]: That Smeargle...\nIt's so lively and wonderful...\c\nAnd it looks pretty strong, too.\nYou must have raised it with a lot\r\nof love...
Miguel: Ha ha... Thanks, but that's normal\nfor Ace Trainers.\c\nYour [VAR 0102(0000)]\nis also quite lovely!\c\n(...Heh heh heh. Wonderful, huh?\nSay that about me! C'mon!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Th-thank you...\c\nI know you're talking about [VAR 0102(0000)],\nbut it almost feels like it's about me...
Miguel: It's absolutely wonderful...\n[VAR 0102(0000)]...and so are you...\c\n(...Whoops! I actually said that! But, her\nface is so cute when she's being shy!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?
Miguel: Ex-excuse me!\c\n(...Oh no... Now I've done it...\nThat would drive someone off...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's sweet...
Miguel: Ah... OK! OK!\nNow we're having a Pokémon battle!\r\nLet's focus!\c\n(...OK! I've decided!\nI'm going to throw this match!...)\c\n(...I'll make her look good and immediately\npraise her strength!...)\c\n(...I'll shower her with a deluge\nof compliments! This should work!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
Miguel: Um! OK!\c\nNever mind! Let's just forget about that\nand get back to battling!\c\n(...Aahhh...\nShe's completely freaked out...)
Smeargle: Argle argle!\c\n(...Oh for pete's sake!...)\c\n(...Miguel's fallen in love with a Trainer\nat first sight again...)\c\n(...And what's more, it looks like he plans\nto throw the match...\r\nHmph... I won't have it!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Impressive...\c\nYour Smeargle is really strong, Miguel...
Smeargle: Meargle! Smeargle!\c\n(...Yeah! Of course I am!\nNow, let me finish this!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sigh...\nMy [VAR 0102(0000)] just isn't enough...
Miguel: That's not true at all!\nYour [VAR 0102(0000)] is a\r\ntruly intense opponent, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\r\nThis is where the battle really begins!\c\n(...Hey! Smeargle!\nSettle down!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll do my best!
Miguel: OK! Here we go!\c\n(...Hey! You know what's going on, right?\nLose, but don't let her know\r\nit's on purpose! Got it, Smeargle?!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Doesn't look good...
Miguel: You can do it!\nIf anyone can, it's you, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\r\nI know you can!\r\nIf you give up, you'll never win!\c\n(...What gives?! Smeargle!!\nDon't just use any old move you want to!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Phew...\nI did it... I won...
Smeargle: Arg! Argle!\c\n(...Whaa! Why?\nWhy do I have to lose to\r\nan opponent like this?\r\nMiguel! What's this supposed to mean?...)
Miguel: Tch... I blew it...\c\n(...All right! I lost for real!\nOK! Now is the beginning\r\nof my real battle!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\nAre you OK?\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)]'s move didn't hit\nyou, did it?
Miguel: What? Oh, I'm fine...\c\nStill, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nYou're really good!\c\n(...All right! Here we go!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you very much.\c\nBut, I'm so ashamed that I\nhurt you, Miguel!
Miguel: Don't worry about it!\c\n(...Yes! It's finally come!\nA chance for love!\r\nGo, Miguel!!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh...\nHow can I make this up to you...
Miguel: Don't worry about it!\c\nMore importantly, I lost. That means I have\nto give you your prize money, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\n(...OK! Come on!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't...\nI feel too bad, Miguel.\r\nI can't accept prize money from you...
Miguel: That's no good.\c\nWell, if that's the case, instead of\nme giving you prize money,\r\nhow about we train together?\c\nI may have lost this time,\nbut I'm an Ace Trainer...\c\nI'm sure I can help\nyou out somehow, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\n(...OK! Everything is going smoothly!\nIt's perfect! Absolutely perfect!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You don't mind?\c\nI'd be honored to train\nwith an Ace Trainer...
Miguel: No! Of course not!\n(...Yeeeeeeeeeeeeees!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: OK, then.\nI look forward to training with you!
Miguel: Me, too!\nI'll make a fun training program!\c\n(...I did it! Woo-hoo!\nI won! I'm the winner!...)
Smeargle: Arg... Arg...\c\n(...Miguel...that's just pathetic...)\c\n(...Well, I suppose...)\c\n(...Humans are just at this level...)
...If eyes meet, a Pokémon\nbattle bursts into bloom.\c\nIf eyes meet, sometimes\nlove will blossom as well.\c\nFor young Trainers,\nPokémon battles are not\r\nsimple competitions.\c\nThey are also a way to meet others...\c\nThis is how love blossoms and\nfades between Trainers each day...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I lost...\nThat is why you're an Ace Trainer...
Miguel: Oh! No...\c\n(...Hey! Smeargle!\nWhat have you done!...)
Smeargle: Mear! Meargle meargle!\c\n(...This is what I can really do!\nI'm not going to lose to\r\nsome mediocre Trainer like her!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you...\c\nSigh...\nGuess I still have a ways to go...
Miguel: That's not true!\nThat was a good battle, [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hee hee...\c\nYou don't have to cheer me up.\nI'm OK.\c\nI'm going to go home\nand train a little bit.
Miguel: What?\c\nIf that's the case,\nwhy don't you train with me?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\c\nI couldn't ask an Ace Trainer\nlike you something like that.\c\nIf you'll excuse me...
Miguel: Oh... No...\nMy excitement...\r\nMy romance is gone...\c\nHey! Smeargle!\nWhat did you do that for?\c\nYou and I are through!\nI'm going to trade you away!
...If eyes meet, a Pokémon\nbattle bursts into bloom.\c\nIf eyes meet, sometimes\nlove will blossom as well.\c\nFor young Trainers,\nPokémon battles are not\r\nsimple competitions.\c\nThey are also a way to meet others...\c\nThis is how love blossoms and\nfades between Trainers each day...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Puff, puff...\c\nMiguel, your Smeargle\nis so tough...
Smeargle: Arg! Argle!\c\n(...Erg... You're a stubborn one!\nJust give up already!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It still\nseems completely full of energy...\r\nYou're amazing, Smeargle...\c\nSo cool...
Smeargle: Arrrgle!\c\n(...What's with this Trainer?\nWhy is she looking at me like that...\r\nShe's really creepy...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Miguel...
Miguel: What? What's up?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That Smeargle...\nI think it's really wonderful...
Miguel: Th-thanks...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\nThis is hard for me to say, but...
Miguel: Hm? What's wrong?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That Smeargle...\c\nWill you trade it to me for\nmy [VAR 0102(0000)]?
Miguel: Huh?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I...\c\nI love your Smeargle.\nIt was love at first sight...\c\nSo please...\c\nI beg you!\nPlease trade with me!
Miguel: Whaat?\c\n(...Well... What should I do...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Please!\c\nTrade me your Smeargle!\c\nWe'll always get along,\nand I'll take great care of it forever!
Miguel: When you put it that way...\c\n(...Oh, her eyes are like clear pools...)\c\n(...Oh...why does it have to be Smeargle...\nI'm the one who likes you...\r\nI wanted you to say those\r\nwords to me, not Smeargle...)\c\n(...Well, for now, I guess I'll\njust hide my feelings...)\c\n(...If I trade Smeargle to her,\nmaybe we can get to know each other...)
Smeargle: Arg! Argle!\c\n(...For pete's sake, Miguel...)\c\n(...Trading me so easily after all\nwe've been through, just because\r\nyou're blinded by love.\r\nWell, what can you do?...)\c\n(...It's the destiny of us Pokémon\nto be traded and to pass from\r\nperson to person...)\c\n(...I guess I'll just do my best\nso my new Trainer doesn't\r\nget tired of me...)
...If eyes meet, a Pokémon\nbattle bursts into bloom.\c\nIf eyes meet, sometimes\nlove will blossom as well.\c\nBut these once-in-a-lifetime feelings\ndon't just occur between humans.\c\nThis is how love blossoms and\nfades between Trainers each day...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: So strong... I expected\nas much from an Ace Trainer's Smeargle...
Smeargle: Meargle! Smeargle!\c\n(...Miguel! Enough already!\nHow much time are we going to\r\nwaste on this scrub of a Trainer!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: So wonderful...
Smeargle: Arg-argle!\c\n(...Why is she staring at me...\nCreepy girl...\r\nI need to end this battle soon, or...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I wonder if I can win...
Smeargle: Arrrg! Argle!\c\n(...Ha ha ha! She's showing weakness!\nOK... Now's my chance!...)
Smeargle: Arg! Argle eargle!\c\n(...Tch! This Trainer...\nShe picks fairly clever moves...)
Miguel: Using that move now?\c\n(...Huh? Seriously? Does she not\nrealize what item my Smeargle is holding?...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What do you think?\nDo you like the tactic I thought up?
Miguel: N-not bad!\nGuess I can't afford any mistakes!\c\n(...Hmm... That move attracts someone,\nright? That isn't much of a tactic...)\c\n(...Oh... Hey... Wait!\nCould it be?...)\c\n(...The move wasn't meant for Smeargle,\nbut it was a hidden message?...)\c\n(...That would mean that she and I are...\nGee hee! Mee hee! Gwa ha ha ha!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\c\nMiguel, are you all right?\c\nYour face looks a little red.
Miguel: Gwa ha ha ha...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, Miguel!\nAre you listening to me? Are you OK?
Miguel: Uh, yeah!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Miguel?
Miguel: Oh, sorry!\c\nOK, OK, let's continue the battle!\c\n(...Phew! That was way too close!\nI was imagining things\r\nI could never say to her...)

Penelope: That's not true at all!\nYour [VAR 0102(0000)] is a\r\ntruly intense opponent, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\r\nThis is where the battle really begins!\c\n(...Hey! Smeargle!\nSettle down!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll do my best!
Penelope: OK! Here we go!\c\n(...Hey! You know what's going on, right?\nLose, but don't let him know\r\nit's on purpose! Got it, Smeargle?!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Doesn't look good...
Penelope: You can do it!\nIf anyone can, it's you, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\r\nI know you can!\r\nIf you give up, you'll never win!\c\n(...Hey?! Smeargle!!\nStop using any old move you want to!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Phew...\nI did it... I won...
Smeargle: Arg! Argle!\c\n(...Whaa! Why?\nWhy do I have to lose to\r\nan opponent like this?\r\nPenelope! What's this supposed to mean!...)
Penelope: Tch... Amazing...\nI've been beat...\c\n(...All right! I lost for real!\nOK! Now is the beginning\r\nof my real battle!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\nAre you OK?\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)]'s move didn't hit\nyou, did it, Penelope?
Penelope: What? Oh, I'm fine...\c\nStill, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nYou're sooo strong!\c\n(...All right! Here I go!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you very much.\c\nBut I'm so ashamed that I\nhurt you, Penelope!
Penelope: Don't worry about it!\c\n(...Yes! It's finally come!\nA chance for love!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh...\nHow can I make this up to you...
Penelope: Don't worry about it!\c\nMore importantly, I lost. That means I have\nto give you your prize money, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\n(...OK! It all comes down to this\nnext bit!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't...\nI feel too bad, Penelope.\r\nI can't accept prize money from you...
Penelope: Oh...\c\nWell, if that's the case, instead of\nme giving you prize money,\r\nhow about we train together?\c\nI may have lost this time,\nbut I'm an Ace Trainer...\c\nI'm sure I can help\nyou out somehow, [VAR 0100(0001)].\c\n(...OK! Everything is going smoothly!\nIt's perfect! Absolutely perfect!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You don't mind?\c\nI'd be honored to train\nwith an Ace Trainer...\c\nIf you don't mind training with me...
Penelope: No! Of course not!\n(...Yeeeeeeeeeeeeees!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: OK, then.\nI look forward to training with you!
Penelope: Me, too!\nI'll make a fun training program!\c\n(...I did it! Woo-hoo!\nI won my own little battle of the sexes!...)
Smeargle: Arg... Arg...\c\n(...Penelope...that's just pitiful...)\c\n(...Well, I guess...)\c\n(...Humans are just at this level...)
...If eyes meet, a Pokémon\nbattle bursts into bloom.\c\nIf eyes meet, sometimes\nlove will blossom as well.\c\nFor young Trainers,\nPokémon battles are not\r\nsimple competitions.\c\nThey are also a way to meet others...\c\nThis is how love blossoms and\nfades between Trainers each day...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I lost...\nThat is why you're an Ace Trainer...
Penelope: Oh! No...\c\n(...Hey! Smeargle!\nWhat have you done?...)
Smeargle: Mear! Meargle meargle!\c\n(...This is what I can really do!\nThere's no way I'd lose to\r\nsome mediocre Trainer like him!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you...\c\nSigh...\nGuess I still have a ways to go...
Penelope: That's not true!\nThat was a good battle, [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ha ha ha...\c\nYou don't have to cheer me up.\nI'm OK.\c\nI'm going to go home\nand train a little bit.
Penelope: What?\c\nIf that's the case,\nwhy don't you train with me?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\c\nI couldn't ask an Ace Trainer\nlike you something like that.\c\nIf you'll excuse me...
Penelope: Oh... No...\nMy excitement...\r\nMy romance is gone...\c\nHey! Smeargle!\nWhat did you do that for?\c\nYou and I are through!\nI'm going to trade you away!
...If eyes meet, a Pokémon\nbattle bursts into bloom.\c\nIf eyes meet, sometimes\nlove will blossom as well.\c\nFor young Trainers,\nPokémon battles are not\r\nsimple competitions.\c\nThey are also a way to meet others...\c\nThis is how love blossoms and\nfades between Trainers each day...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Puff, puff...\c\nPenelope, your Smeargle\nis so tough...
Smeargle: Arg! Argle!\c\n(...You're a stubborn one!\nJust give up already!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It still\nseems completely full of energy...\r\nYou're amazing, Smeargle...\c\n...So cool...
Smeargle: Arrrgle!\c\n(...What's with this Trainer?\nWhy is he looking at me like that...\r\nHe's really creepy...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Penelope...
Penelope: What? What's up?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That Smeargle...\nI think it's really wonderful...
Penelope: Th-thanks...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\nThis is hard for me to say, but...
Penelope: Hm? What's wrong?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That Smeargle...\c\nWill you trade it to me for\nmy [VAR 0102(0000)]?
Penelope: Huh?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I...\c\nI love your Smeargle.\nIt was love at first sight...\c\nSo please...\c\nI beg you!\nPlease trade with me!
Penelope: Whaat?\c\n(...Well... What should I do...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Please!\c\nPlease give me your Smeargle!\c\nI'll make it very happy! I promise!
Penelope: When you put it that way...\c\n(...What a withering stare...)\c\n(...Oh...why does he love Smeargle...\nI'm the one who likes you...\r\nI wanted you to say those\r\nwords to me, not Smeargle...)\c\n(...Well, for now, I guess I'll\njust hide my feelings...)\c\n(...If I trade Smeargle to him,\nmaybe we can get to know each other...)
Smeargle: Arg! Argle!\c\n(...For pete's sake, Penelope...)\c\n(...Trading me so easily after all\nwe've been through, just because\r\nyou're blinded by love.\r\nWell, what can you do?...)\c\n(...It's the destiny of us Pokémon\nto be traded and to pass from\r\nperson to person...)\c\n(...I guess I'll just do my best\nso my new Trainer doesn't\r\nget tired of me...)
...If eyes meet, a Pokémon\nbattle bursts into bloom.\c\nIf eyes meet, sometimes\nlove will blossom as well.\c\nBut these once-in-a-lifetime feelings\ndon't just occur between humans.\c\nThis is how love blossoms and\nfades between Trainers each day...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: So strong... I expected\nas much from an Ace Trainer's Smeargle...
Smeargle: Meargle! Smeargle!\c\n(...Penelope! Enough already!\nHow much time are we going to\r\nwaste on this scrub of a Trainer!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: So wonderful...
Smeargle: Arg-argle!\c\n(...Why is he staring at me...\nCreepy...\r\nI need to end this battle soon, or...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I wonder if I can win...
Smeargle: Arrrg! Argle!\c\n(...Ha ha ha! He's showing weakness!\nOK... Now's my chance!...)
Smeargle: Arg! Argle eargle!\c\n(...Tch! This Trainer...\nHe picks fairly clever moves...)
Penelope: Using that move now?\c\n(...Hey, seriously? Does he not\nrealize what item my Smeargle is holding?...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What do you think?\nDo you like the tactic I thought up?
Penelope: N-not bad!\nGuess I can't afford any mistakes!\c\n(...Hmm... That move attracts someone,\nright? That isn't much of a tactic...)\c\n(...Oh... Hey... Wait!\nCould it be?...)\c\n(...The move wasn't meant for Smeargle,\nbut it was a hidden message?...)\c\n(...That would mean that he and I are...\nHoo! Eh heh! Uwe hee hee hee...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\c\nPenelope, are you all right?\c\nYour face looks a little red.
Penelope: Uwe hee hee hee...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, Penelope!\nAre you listening to me? Are you OK?
Penelope: Uh, yeah!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Penelope?
Penelope: Oh, sorry!\c\nOK, OK, let's continue the battle!\c\n(...Phew! That was way too close!\nI was imagining dizzying things\r\nlike this and that...)

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um, I...\nFrom the first time I saw you,\r\nI couldn't think about anything else!\c\nI love you!
Camilo: Me and you?\nThat joke's not very funny.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm serious.\nI won't leave until I get an answer!
Camilo: Hm...\c\n(...Oh, what a precocious little princess.\nMakes me want to be a little mean to her...)
Camilo: How about this, then?\nWant to have a Pokémon battle\r\nto test how compatible we are?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Y-yes! I'll battle you!
Camilo: Hm... That's good!\c\n(...Heh heh heh... I can't wait...\nSeeing a girl fighting to hold\r\nback tears is always moving...)
Smeargle: Argle! Arrrrg!
Camilo: OK! Here I come!\c\n(...Smeargle's raring to go, too!...)\c\n(...The girls who've professed their\nlove to me so far...\r\nI've made as many cry as there are stars.\r\nAnd yet I still haven't found her...\r\nMy sweetie...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: C-Camilo!\nBefore we start,\r\nI have a request!\r\nIf I win...
Camilo: If you win?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Marry me!
Camilo: Whaaaat?!\nMarriage? When you say marriage,\r\ndo you mean THAT marriage?\c\nYou need to think more of yourself...\nThat's no good! That's seriously bad!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Let's go on a date!

[VAR 0100(0001)]: C-Camilo...\nYou're so cool...
Camilo: What?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: When you don't like what you\nhear, you express your opinion directly!\c\nThinking of me like that...\nYou are a wonderful person!
Camilo: Ah, I see...\c\n(...You've GOT to be kidding...\nShe is really tough!\r\nNo more Mr. Nice Guy...)
Camilo: Give it a rest!\c\nI don't care about you at all, all right?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: So manly...
Camilo: Aaahhh! C'mon!\nDo you have wax in your ears?!\r\nIf I can't make you understand with words,\r\nI guess I'll have to use force!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Please do!

Camilo: If you want to be friends,\nI'll hang out with you!
Camilo: Hm...\c\n(...What is this? It's weird.\nA girl who makes me feel good\r\njust by being around me.\r\nMy sweetie?!...)
Just as battles aren't won\nby power alone,\c\nthe strongest person doesn't always\nwin in relationships either.
Turning the other cheek!\nThat's another form love takes!

Just as the results of\nbattle don't follow a set pattern,\r\nrelationships between people don't\r\nalways go how you would expect.
Sometimes you must endure\na painful parting because you care!\r\nThat's another form love takes!
Smeargle: Arg... Argle argle...
Camilo: Tsk. What?\nYou're terrible!\r\nBeating up my little Smeargle like that!\c\nSeriously! I can't believe you!\nI'm sorry. I never want to see you again.\r\nYou're...no good...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No good...\nI'm a terrible girl...\r\nCamilo, you're so tough!\c\nEh heh heh... Eh heh heh heh...\c\nThat's what's great about you!
Just as crazy things happen\nin the world of battling,\c\nyou never know what is\ngoing to happen in relationships.
Some people take painful and\ncruel treatment with joy!\r\nThat's another form love takes!
Camilo: What is it about you?\nI can't figure you out...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hee hee.
Camilo: Just getting involved won't work.\nTrying to interact with you wears me out...\r\nGuess I'll just leave you alone...

Smeargle: Smearrrrgle!

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Whoa!\nSmeargle talked!
Smeargle: Oh please...\nThat's a ghost standing in front of you.\r\nDon't you think that compared to that,\r\na talking Pokémon is pretty tame?

Smeargle: He died!\c\nBut Antonio became a ghost\nand came here to meet you!\c\nThere was a little accident,\nand he lost his memory...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: I lied...\c\nThere is no way I could\never hate you!\c\nThere's no way I could!\nI love you!
Antonio: Hmm... Mmmmmrhhhgh!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: OK...\c\n(...I'll decide everything with this!\nI'll throw my whole heart at him!...)
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Come to my world!
Antonio: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I love you!
Antonio: Mmm... Mmmmrrgh!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll give you my life!
Antonio: ...?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Let's start over!
Antonio: Mmm... Mmmmrrrgh!
Antonio: ...
Smeargle: OK! Too bad!\nThis won't work at all, will it?\c\nSimply stated, you're too weak.\c\nAt this rate, Antonio's memory\nwill never come back!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Please!\nGive me another chance!
Smeargle: Well, that's not possible!\c\nIf Antonio stays in this world too long,\nhis body will melt and disappear like snow\r\nin the hot sun!\c\nWe've already stayed too long,\nso we're done for today!\c\nWell, we'll come back tomorrow,\nso try your best then!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait!\nAntonio! Smeargle!\c\n...
Next thing I knew, I was sitting on\na bench in the amusement park alone...\c\nWas it a dream?\nWas it real?\c\nRegardless, I will be coming back to\nthe amusement park again tomorrow.
Smeargle: My, my, how unfortunate!\nWe didn't reach a conclusion!\c\nThis isn't enough to bring\nAntonio's memory back!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Please!\nBattle with me again!
Smeargle: Well, that's not possible!\c\nIf Antonio stays in this world too long,\nhis body will melt and disappear like snow\r\nin the hot sun!\c\nWe've already stayed too long,\nso we're done for today!\c\nWell, we'll come back tomorrow,\nso try your best then!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait!\nAntonio! Smeargle!\c\n...
Next thing I knew, I was sitting on\na bench in the amusement park alone...\c\nWas it a dream?\nWas it real?\c\nRegardless, I will be coming back to\nthe amusement park again tomorrow.
Smeargle: Oh, so close!\nWe didn't wrap it up!\c\nWell, we'll continue in\nyour dream again tomorrow.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: My dream?
Smeargle: That's right!\nYou're dreaming!\r\nThis is all happening in a dream!\c\nFor starters, you and Antonio\nlive together happily in real life!\c\nOh! You look like you're about to\noversleep, so Antonio's coming to wake you!\c\n...
Voice: [VAR 0100(0001)]! It's morning!\c\nVoice: Come on! Time to get up!\nHurry up, or you'll be late!\c\n...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh? What?
When I opened my eyes,\nI was greeted by Antonio's smiling face...\c\nBut when I fall asleep, I always\nreturn to that amusement park.\c\nA silent Antonio is there with Smeargle,\nand a Pokémon battle starts.\c\nThen when I wake up,\na healthy Antonio is there...\c\nThe same things keep\nhappening over and over...
Which is real?\c\nAre they both dreams?\nAre they both real?\r\nWell, I guess it doesn't matter...\c\nFor me, if Antonio is by my side...\c\nI'm happy if only that is true...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Antonio!
Antonio: ...\n...\r\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...\r\n[VAR 0100(0001)]! [VAR 0100(0001)]!\r\nIt's [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You remembered!\nOh, Antonio, I'm so happy!\r\nI'm so happy to see you again!\c\nSo what happened?\nHow could you forget me?
Antonio: I came back to this world\nin order to meet you.\c\nBut I was shocked by\nhow much you've changed...\c\nI don't remember anything\nafter that...\c\nI never would've imagined\nyou would turn out like that...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I was sad that\nyou weren't here anymore...\c\nDid I look that bad?
Smeargle: ...\n[VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nCould it be your memory has\ngone blank recently, too?\c\nIs all you have left vague memories\nof enjoying this amusement park\r\nwith Antonio?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\c\n...\c\nActually, I don't remember.\c\nWhat was I doing?\nAnd yesterday, the day before that...\r\nWhy? I can't...\r\nI can't remember anything...
Smeargle: I knew it!\c\nYou don't understand\nthe state you're in...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]... When Antonio died,\nyou took your last breath as well.\r\nIt was like you were following him...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\nI'm already dead?
Smeargle: That's right!\c\nYou died a long time ago,\nbut you remained in this world.\c\nYou stayed here in the amusement\npark, which is full of happy memories,\r\nand wandered around without\r\nremembering what happened.\c\nBut dead people can't\nstay in this world forever.\c\nIf you lose your body and your\nmemory, you won't be yourself anymore!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: How can this be?\nHow do you know all of this?\r\nSmeargle...\r\nWhat ARE you?
Smeargle: I came here at\nAntonio's request to rescue\r\nyou from wandering.\c\nWhen Antonio came with me and\nsaw how much you'd changed,\r\nhe lost his memory in shock.\c\nAnd you, who'd lost your memory,\ngot it back from the shock of\r\nseeing Antonio again!\c\nWell six one way, half a dozen the other.\nOr we're back where we started!\r\nYou two are a perfect match!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\nI see... So that's what happened...
Antonio: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nLet's go...\c\nThis world isn't where we\nshould be anymore...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Of course...\nI'll go with you, Antonio...\c\nI don't know what kind of world it will be.\nIt seems that it will have strange\r\nthings, like Pokémon that talk.\c\nBut if I'm already dead,\nthere's nothing to fear now.
Smeargle: It's not scary at all!\c\nYou'll love it!\nThere's even an amusement park!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hee hee! I see!\c\nBut you know what, if I'm with Antonio,\nany place is fine.
Smeargle: What a hot couple!\nOK! You lovely pair!\c\nLet's get going to the world\nthat isn't here!
And that was how\nAntonio and I met again...\c\nIt looks like we both died,\nbut my beloved Antonio\r\nis smiling sweetly next to me...\r\nI have no regrets...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Whoa!\nSmeargle talked!
Smeargle: Oh please...\nThat's a ghost standing in front of you.\r\nDon't you think that compared to that,\r\na talking Pokémon is pretty tame?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: A ghost?!\n...\r\nThat's right... A year ago...\r\nMaria...
Smeargle: She died!\c\nBut Maria became a ghost\nand came here to meet you!\c\nThere was a little accident,\nand she lost her memory...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?\nGhosts can lose their memories?
Smeargle: Come now...\nA Pokémon is talking to you!\c\nCompared to that, a ghost losing\nits memory isn't that surprising, right?\c\nMore importantly, there isn't much\ntime, so to get to the point,\r\nplease battle with me and Maria!\c\nI'm sure that seeing you in action\nwill bring back Maria's memory!

Movie Star
Strange Lady
Bellelba: Stop!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: H-huh?\nWhere could I be?\r\nIt feels so strange here...\c\nWhat could that white door\nI opened have been, anyway?
Strange Lady: My, my...\c\nIt looks like a weak little child\nwandered through the\r\ndoor I set up as a trap.\c\nEeee hee hee... Great timing.\nI need a new servant.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hm? Who are you?\nWhy are you in a place like this, woman?\c
Strange Lady: Grr...\c\nCalling someone you just met “woman"?\nWhat a rude little brat!\c\nHow can you look like that and\nnot know how to address people?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's with you?\c\nYa know, lady? I'd really like\nto get out of here soon.\c\nI'm the princess of this kingdom, so show\nme how to get back to the castle already!
Strange Lady: I'm afraid that's impossible.\c\nAnd I'm not just some lady.\nI'm the queen of the Land of Enchantment.\r\nMy name is Bellelba!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: How about that...\nQueen of the Land of Enchantment, huh?\r\n...\c\nWhoooooa! A w-witch!\c\nI h-have to hurry back\nthrough that door!
Bellelba: Weee hee hee... Fool.\nYou can't run away.\r\nHave a look behind you.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: No! No! No!\nA Pokémon is blocking the door!\c\nIf one of my servants was here,\nthey'd give it a good wallop, too!
Bellelba: Ah ha ha!\nCan't you do anything on your own?\r\nWhat a pitiful princess!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's right...\nI'm alone right now...\c\nI guess if I don't want to be caught,\nthe only thing to do is fight for myself...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I've had it with this!\nThose Woobat are getting closer and closer!\c\nI have to hurry and...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Defeat them!
Bellelba: Ah ha ha!\nTry if you dare!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Catch them!
Bellelba: Hey!\c\nCatching someone else's Pokémon\nis stealing! That's common sense, right?!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Use my Pokédex!
Bellelba: You've got to be kidding...\nWoobat is a Bat Pokémon!\c\nAnd just so you know, Swoobat\nis a Courting Pokémon!\c\nSigh... Are you that confident?\nOr that stupid?
Bellelba: You're wasting your time.\nOnce you pass through that door,\r\nyou can't go back to your own world.\c\nYour destiny is to be caught by me\nand to become my loyal servant.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Well...\nThey're even closer than before!\c\nI don't want to be a servant!\nMe serving someone else?!\r\nThat's impossible!
Bellelba: Acting tough, are we?\nYou're worth pushing around, aren't you?\r\nHah...
Bellelba: OK!\nWe've almost got you!\c\nAre you ready?\nYou'll be in my clutches soon!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I won't quit!
Bellelba: Oh...\nFeeling brave, huh?\c\nThat just makes me want\nto make you suffer more!\c\nAh ha ha ha ha...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm done for!
Bellelba: Oh, how pessimistic.\c\nOh, the youth of today give up\nso very easily...\r\nWell, time to join me, then!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: But I'm rich!
Bellelba: What? Money?\nThat's a weird thing for a brat to say!\c\nA-and it's not like I want\nyour money anyway!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh...\nIf I'd only listened to Father,\r\nI wouldn't be in this mess.\c\nNo one's going to come save me...\nGuess I have to do something on my own...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee...\nWhat are you mumbling about?!\c\nYou're almost ours now!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh...\nI wonder if I can win...\c\nI don't even care anymore...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee... Wonderful...\nI'll tell you something interesting.\c\nBreathing the air in this world\nsaps your will.\c\nI wonder how long you and your Pokémon\nwill have the desire to keep fighting.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Sheesh...\nThis...is really stupid...\r\nBut...if I don't beat you...\r\nI'll be made a servant...
Bellelba: Not bad at all.\nB-by the way, what was that\r\nmoney you were talking about earlier?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ha ha haaa!\nThis is my allowance for ONE week!\c\nDon't you want it?\nIf you want to be rich,\r\nsend me to my castle now!
Bellelba: Wh-whaaat?!\nIn one week, you get THIS much\r\nmoney for an allowance?!\c\nWow! Is my fortune so small?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hee hee...\nPoor peasant...\r\nI'm heiress to the throne!\r\nOf course there's a difference!
Bellelba: Gr...\c\nI'm going to take your money,\nyour crown, and everything else!
Bellelba: You're kidding!\nYou're so weak!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: No...\nI lost...
Bellelba: Wow...\nWouldn't it be better if you\r\ntrained in battle a little bit?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes...\nYou're exactly right...
Bellelba: Good grief...\nInstead of getting soft in the castle,\r\nhow about going on a journey?\c\nWell... Actually, I know this guy--\nhis head is as smooth as a cue ball,\r\nand he's really tough.\r\nShall I introduce him to you?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What? Really?\c\nAn older guy? Bald? Tough?\nSounds handsome--just my type!\c\nYou don't mind?\nI'd really, really like that!\c\nYaaay! Yaaay!\nBald and handsome!
Bellelba: Wow...\c\nI don't want a brat like you\nin my Land of Enchantment...
So Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]\nset off to train.\c\nOr better said, she set off\non a journey to meet the guy.\c\nAt any rate, she got out\nof the door safely,\r\nso that's probably for the best...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh, I'm so tired...
Bellelba: Well now...\nI'm all caught up!\c\nAre you ready?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Help!\nFather, save me!\c\nIf I'd known this was going to happen,\nI'd have listened and behaved better!
Bellelba: Eee hee heee...\nI knew you were a princess\r\nfrom the very beginning.\c\nAnd that you are a vapid, foolish princess\nwho doesn't listen to her parents\r\nand does nothing more than goof off.\c\nI already anticipated\nthat you'd come here.\c\nAnd now, that foolish princess\nis going to go missing.\c\nWhen that happens, it will cause\nchaos in the country, and a war will begin.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's that about?\nSomething like that would never happen\r\nin a kingdom like mine!
Bellelba: I wonder about that...\c\nDo you think people can trust a king\nwho can't protect his heiress,\r\neven if it is an idiot like you?\c\nI also suspect that your father\nwill get worn out as he tears apart\r\neverything looking for you.\c\nSome nobleman might take advantage\nof this and take his place.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: You...\nYou were hired by the nobleman!\c\nFather! Father!\n[VAR 0100(0001)] is here!
Bellelba: That's not going to work.\nI don't think you have time to worry.\c\nFrom today on, you're my new servant.\c\nLet's go! Get walking!
The captured Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]\nis said to have worked in Bellelba's mansion\r\nuntil she died...\c\nAs Bellelba said, the evil nobleman\nstole the throne from the king\r\nand the country was destroyed...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I did it!\nI defeated the Swoobat!\r\nI can escape now...\c\nHuh?!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Where is it?\nCome on! Where's the exit?\r\nWhere is that door?!
Bellelba: Oh my, didn't I say\nthat escape was impossible?\c\nThe door back to your old world\nisn't here anymore!

Strange Lady
Bellelba: Stop!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\nWhere is this place?\r\nIt feels so strange here...\c\nWhat could that white door\nI opened have been, anyway?
Strange Lady: My, my...\c\nIt looks like a weak little child\nwandered through the door\r\nI set up as a trap.\c\nEeee hee hee... Great timing.\nI need a new servant.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hm? Who are you?\nWhy are you in a place like this, woman?\c
Strange Lady: Grr...\c\nCalling someone you just met “woman"?\nWhat a rude little brat!\c\nHow can you look like that and\nnot know how to address people?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's with you?\c\nKnow what, lady? I'd really like\nto get out of here soon.\c\nI'm the prince of this kingdom, so show\nme how to get back to the castle, already!
Strange Lady: I'm afraid that's impossible.\c\nAnd I'm not just some lady.\nI'm the queen of the Land of Enchantment.\r\nMy name is Bellelba!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: How about that...\nQueen of the Land of Enchantment, huh?\r\n...\c\nWhoooooa! A w-witch!\c\nI h-have to hurry back\nthrough that door!
Bellelba: Weee hee hee... Fool.\nYou can't run away.\r\nHave a look behind you.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: No! No! No!\nA Pokémon is blocking the door!\c\nIf one of my servants was here,\nthey'd give it a good wallop, too!
Bellelba: Ah ha ha!\nCan't you do anything on your own?\r\nWhat a pitiful prince!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's right...\nI'm alone right now...\c\nI guess if I don't want to be caught,\nthe only thing to do is fight for myself...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Whoa! Oh no!\nThose Woobat are getting closer and closer!\c\nI have to hurry and...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Defeat them!
Bellelba: Ah ha ha!\nTry if you dare!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Catch them!
Bellelba: Hey!\c\nCatching someone else's Pokémon\nis stealing! That's common sense, right?!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Use my Pokédex!
Bellelba: You've got to be kidding...\nWoobat is a Bat Pokémon!\c\nAnd just so you know, Swoobat\nis a Courting Pokémon!\c\nSigh... Are you that confident?\nOr that stupid?
Bellelba: You're wasting your time.\nOnce you pass through that door,\r\nyou can't go back to your own world.\c\nYour destiny is to be caught by me\nand to become my loyal servant.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Well...\nThey're even closer than before!\c\nI don't want to be a servant!\nI can't serve someone else!
Bellelba: Acting tough, are we?\nYou're worth pushing around, aren't you?\r\nHah...
Bellelba: OK!\nWe've almost got you!\c\nAre you ready?\nYou'll be in my clutches soon!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I won't quit!
Bellelba: Oh...\nFeeling brave, huh?\c\nThat just makes me want\nto make you suffer more!\c\nAh ha ha ha ha...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm done for!
Bellelba: Oh, how pessimistic.\c\nOh, the youth of today give up\nso very easily...\r\nWell, time to join me, then!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: But I'm rich!
Bellelba: What? Money?\nThat's a weird thing for a brat to say!\c\nA-and it's not like I want\nyour money anyway!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh...\nIf I'd only listened to Father,\r\nI wouldn't be in this mess.\c\nNo one's going to come save me...\nGuess I have to do something on my own...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee...\nWhat are you mumbling about?!\c\nYou're almost ours now!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh...\nI wonder if I can win...\c\nI don't even care anymore...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee... Wonderful...\nI'll tell you something interesting.\c\nBreathing the air in this world\nsaps your will.\c\nI wonder how long you and your Pokémon\nwill have the desire to keep fighting.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Sheesh...\nThis...is really stupid...\r\nBut...if I don't beat you...\r\nI'll be made a servant...
Bellelba: Not bad at all.\nB-by the way, what was that\r\nmoney you were talking about earlier?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ha ha haaa!\nThis is my allowance for ONE week!\c\nDon't you want it?\nIf you want to be rich,\r\ntake me to my castle now!
Bellelba: Wh-whaaat?!\nIn one week, you get THIS much\r\nmoney for an allowance?!\c\nWow! Is my fortune so small?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hee hee...\nPoor peasant...\r\nI'm heir to the throne!\r\nOf course there's a difference!
Bellelba: Gr...\c\nI'm going to take your money,\nyour crown, and everything else!
Bellelba: You're kidding!\nYou're so weak!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I lost...\nI lost...
Bellelba: Wow...\nWouldn't it be better if you\r\ntrained in battle a little bit?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Yes...\nYou're exactly right...
Bellelba: Good grief...\nInstead of simply living a life of luxury in\r\nthe castle, how about going on a journey?\c\nActually, I know a beautiful, black-haired\nyoung woman who is really strong.\c\nShall I introduce her to you?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What? Really?\c\nBlack haired? Beautiful?\nAnd she's young?\c\nYou don't mind?\nI'd really, really like that!\c\nYaaay! Yaaay!\nA beautiful, black-haired young woman!
Bellelba: Wow...\c\nI don't want a brat like you\nin my Land of Enchantment...
So Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]\nset off to train.\c\nOr better said, he set off\non a journey to meet the young woman.\c\nAt any rate, he got out\nof the door safely,\r\nand that's probably for the best...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh, I'm so tired...
Bellelba: Well now...\nI'm all caught up!\c\nAre you ready?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Help!\nFather, save me!\c\nIf I'd known this was going to happen,\nI'd have listened and behaved better!
Bellelba: Eee hee heee...\nI knew you were a prince\r\nfrom the very beginning.\c\nAnd that you are a vapid, foolish prince\nwho doesn't listen to his parents\r\nand does nothing more than goof off.\c\nI already anticipated\nthat you'd come here.\c\nAnd now, that foolish prince\nis going to go missing.\c\nWhen that happens, it will cause\nchaos in the country, and a war will begin.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's that about?\nSomething like that would never happen\r\nin a kingdom like mine!
Bellelba: I wonder about that...\c\nDo you think people can trust a king\nwho can't protect his heir,\r\neven if it is an idiot like you?\c\nI also suspect that your father\nwill get worn out as he tears apart\r\neverything looking for you.\c\nSome nobleman might take advantage\nof this and take his throne.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: You...\nYou were hired by the nobleman!\c\nFather! Father!\nI'm over here!
Bellelba: That's not going to work.\nI don't think you have time to worry.\c\nFrom today on, you're my new servant.\c\nLet's go! Get walking!
The captured Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]\nis said to have worked in Bellelba's mansion\r\nuntil he died...\c\nAs Bellelba said, the evil nobleman\nstole the throne from the king\r\nand the country was destroyed...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I did it!\nI defeated the Swoobat!\r\nI can escape now...\c\nHuh?!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Where is it?\nCome on! Where's the exit?\r\nWhere is that door?!
Bellelba: Oh my, didn't I say\nthat escape was impossible?\c\nThe door back to your old world\nisn't here anymore!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's that about!\nWhat in the world is going on?
Bellelba: Good grief you're loud.\nIt would be a lot of trouble if you\r\nwent on a rampage and found the real door.\c\nFor now, I guess I'll just\nshut you in this Magic Cage...

Plush Toy: I don't think that'll work.\c\nYou should just calm down\nand stay here with me...
Plush Toy: Aaaah!\nYou're making such a racket\r\nthat the magic world is creaking!\r\nBellelba's going to be mad...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: The door won't open!\nSomebody let me out of here!
Plush Toy: The gate is enchanted.\nIt can't be opened...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Whoa!\nThe Plush Toy talked!\c\nAmaaazing! How cute!
Plush Toy: Uhhh...\c\nDo you understand the situation you're in?\c\nStill, I don't think I've ever seen anyone\nso happy when they saw me before.\c\nWell, I'm in a good mood today,\nso I'll give you a little hint.\c\nThat door gets weak when it's cold.\nHowever...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: However?
Plush Toy: Ummm...\nI can't say anything more.\c\nFigure out the rest on your own.
Plush Toy: You're trying hard!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Plush Toy!\c\nIf you don't have anything better to\ndo than sit there, give me a hand!
Plush Toy: In case you forgot,\nI AM the gatekeeper here.\r\nMy job is to watch you.\c\nBellelba would get mad at me if I helped.\nAnd besides...\c\nA long time ago, I tried to open the door,\nbut it didn't work.\r\nI failed...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Why?
Plush Toy: I had the same problem as you.\nI didn't know how to break the door.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: You, too?
Plush Toy: What?\c\nDo you feel sorry\nfor me?\c\n...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: *Snicker*
Plush Toy: Harrumph...\nYou know what? You're kind of a creep.
Black Door: Claaaang!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: All right!\nI broke the door, didn't I?\r\nNow I can leave, right?
Plush Toy: No. I'm afraid not...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Why not?\nI broke the door like I was supposed to!
Plush Toy: Don't you get it?\nYou can't just break the\r\ndoor like you did.\c\nYou can't just break something\nmade with magic by force.\c\nI'm sure Bellelba heard that\nnoise and will be on her way.\r\nI don't think she'll forgive you.\c\nHeh heh heh...\c\nLooks like I get people soup tonight.\nIt's been a long time.\c\nYou're a princess, right?\nI'm sure you've been eating well.\r\nYou should make great broth!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: No...\nNoooooo!
Were Plush Toy's words true?\c\nNo one knows...\c\nThere is no record of what happened\nto the princess after that...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Sigh...
Plush Toy: Hey...\nHow long are you going to keep that up?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't help it!\nThis thing's tough!
Plush Toy: Yeah, it should be!\nIt's Bellelba's magic.\c\nStill, you're pretty tough\nfor a princess.\c\nI'm sure you'll be working\nfor her from tomorrow on,\r\nbut you should be able to take it!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Quiet, you!\nI don't need compliments like that!\c\nWhat do you mean working?\nWhat is she going to make me do?
Plush Toy: What will you do?\nThere's a pile of things to do.\c\nCooking, laundry, cleaning...\nEven that is really hard work.\c\nYou also have to take care of\nthings like that door you were fighting.\r\nThey are her pets!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Uwagh!\nThat sounds like such a pain.\c\nThat's the kind of work\nfor a servant!\r\nNot for a princess!
Plush Toy: Come on now...\nLife isn't that easy.\r\nYou are so spoiled.\c\nMaybe a person like you\nshould have been caught...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Whaaa!\nFather! Mother!\r\nMinister! Servants!\r\nSomebody! Save meee!
And so Princess [VAR 0100(0001)],\nshaking with fear about her\r\nwork in the morning, finally\r\nfell asleep.\c\nShe kept telling herself that\nat least she was still alive...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I've been beaten...
Plush Toy: Awww...\nWhat a shame...\c\nBaaad stuff's going to happen to you...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?!
Plush Toy: Those who lose\nto the magic door...\c\n...\c\nThey are turned into doors by the\nmagic that was cast on that door!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey!\nWhat?
Plush Toy: It's just as I said--you're\ngoing to change into a door.\c\nSince you're a princess, I'm sure it's\ngoing to be an ornate door with\r\nlots of gorgeous decorations...\r\nI bet you'll fetch a good price...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: This is terrible!\nI don't want to become a door!\c\nEach and every single day!\nShutting and closing.\r\nShutting and closing.\r\nThat's all I'd ever do!\r\nI can't stand it!
Plush Toy: ...\c\nSo you never plan\non opening, then?\c\nWell, enjoy being able to\nmake dumb jokes while you can...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
And so Princess [VAR 0100(0001)],\nwho lost to the black door,\r\nbecame a door herself.\c\nSurely, she's working as the door\nto some house now...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, Plush Toy.\nIsn't it OK now?\r\nWould you just give me a hint already?
Plush Toy: Like I said, I'm the gatekeeper!\nI can't!\c\nAnd what's more--there is no hint!\c\nEven if you somehow manage to get out,\nyou're going to end up a servant.\c\nThere's no way you can get away\nfrom Bellelba in her own world!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Who cares!\c\nI hate just sitting here quietly\nlocked up in this cage!\c\nA dark, damp place like this isn't\nsuitable for a royal princess\r\nlike myself, now is it?
Plush Toy: Sure... Whatever...\c\nYour pride is a little repulsive,\nbut I feel like you've got some guts.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm gonna do it!\c\nI'm going to break down that door!\nI'll put my pride as a princess at stake!
Plush Toy: You're sure fired up...\nIf you're that excited, you might\r\nbe able to make something work. Maybe...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: But you know what...\nThis is just too much work for me...\r\nI don't care about the stupid door anymore.\c\nHey, Plush Toy.\nI'll give you my allowance.\r\nWould you please let me out?
Plush Toy: Really?! That's your plan?\c\nBribing me? I tell you...\nIf you're the princess of a country,\r\nhumanity's future is looking pretty dark.\c\nFirst of all, I'm a Plush Toy.\nWhat am I supposed to do with money?!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: You shabby reject!\c\nFor a stupid Plush Toy,\nyou've sure got a mouth!\c\nWhatever! I don't need you!\nI'll break it myself!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey...\nWhy were you caught?
Plush Toy: Um...\nI don't really remember...\c\nI'm sure it was a reason\nsimilar to yours though.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...\c\nYou've sure had it hard\nfor a Plush Toy.\r\nThat's why you're worn out and filthy...
Plush Toy: That's too much!\c\nAnd I wasn't born a Plush Toy, you know?!\c\nI used to be a person,\njust like you.\c\nBellelba's spell changed me into this,\nand I have to be the gatekeeper forever...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's terrible!\nWhy don't you run away?
Plush Toy: I know...\nI would like to, but...\c\nUnlike you, I don't have a Pokémon.\c\nAlso, my body is made of cotton,\nso I don't move very well.\c\nI don't really know how I\ncould get away from Bellelba!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't care...
Plush Toy: Y-you're really cold...\c\nWhat's the deal? You were the one\nwho asked about me in the first place...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Flee with me!
Plush Toy: Are you serious?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: How hopeless...
Plush Toy: Well, it's OK.\nYour sympathy won't help me.\r\nIt's not like it's your problem.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\nIt looks like it will break\r\nafter just a little more!
Plush Toy: ...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's wrong?\c\nAre you worried because\nI might get away?
Plush Toy: ...So...about the door...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What about it?
Plush Toy: You can't just break\nthat door with force...\c\nWhen it looks like the door\nis just about to break,\r\nyou need to surprise it...\c\nIf you do that, it will run away without\nbeing broken...\c\nThat's the only way\nto get it out of the way.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\nWhy did you tell me this?\c\nYou're the gatekeeper, right?\nWasn't that the last hint\r\na few minutes ago?
Plush Toy: I am the gatekeeper...\c\nBut...\nYou invited me to run away with you, right?\c\nAnd even though you're grumbling,\nyou don't give up and keep working!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you!\nLet's get out together, for sure!
Plush Toy: Hmmm...\nYou're better than I suspected.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff... Puff...\nI did it... The door's gone...
Plush Toy: Looks like it...\nBut you still can't leave...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's that mean?\nIf I break the door, I can get out!
Plush Toy: Heh heh heh...\nYou DID break the door,\r\nbut the gatekeeper's still here!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I see.\nOK, Plush Toy! Out of the way!\r\nIf you get in my way, I'll turn you into\r\nscraps of cloth and fluff balls!
Plush Toy: Oh. Big talk...\c\nI don't know what's gonna happen to you\nif you think I'm just a ball of fluff!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Bring it on!\nI don't even need a Pokémon\r\nagainst a Plush Toy like you!\c\nI'll pulverize you with the princess\nwrestling style I developed!
Plush Toy: Bring it on...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Try on my\nroyal princess lasso for size!
Plush Toy: Ha...\nI'll stop you...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)] broke the door\nof the magic cage, but a Plush Toy stood\r\nin front of the celebrating princess,\r\nblocking the way.\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)] attacked, but\nthe blow didn't stop the Plush Toy...\c\nThe Plush Toy found an opening and brought\ndown Princess [VAR 0100(0001)] in an instant...
Plush Toy: Whoa! What a surprise!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?!\nWhat's that all of the sudden?
Plush Toy: That Plush Toy...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Oh, this?\nThe toy used for Substitute?\c\nNow that you mention it,\nit does look just like you...
Plush Toy: It sure does...\c\nBut, well, I didn't always look like this.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Really?\c\nOh! Could it be?!\nAre you actually a really\r\nhandsome guy or something like that?
Plush Toy: Well, I wonder...\c\nSince I've been in this world,\nI've kept forgetting about the past.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh! Man!\nI'm really, really curious!\r\nIsn't there some way we can fix this soon?
Plush Toy: Well, I suppose...\nIf I can leave this world somehow,\r\nI might return to normal...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I see...\c\nWell, then we just have to\nget out of here even sooner!\c\nI'm just obsessed with handsome\nboys, men, and gentlemen!
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha...\c\n(...I think I'm fairly good looking,\nbut this puts a bit of pressure on me...)
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha!\c\nYou surprised the black door,\nand it ran away!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I did it!\nThe door's gone!\c\nEverything went as planned, right?
Plush Toy: Looks like it...\nOK, get going then!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What are you saying?\nYou're coming with me!\r\nWe're running away together!\c\nIf I get away while you stay here, as\nthe gatekeeper, you'll be punished, right?
Plush Toy: But...\nEven if we get away,\r\nI don't have anywhere to go...\c\nEven if I leave the cage,\nit's the magic world...\c\nBellelba will catch me\nand wipe me out!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I know that!\nWe can't leave like this!\r\nWe have to do something about Bellelba!\c\nThat's why I will definitely need\nyour advice!\c\nSo you absolutely must\ncome with me!\c\nIf we make it back to our own world,\nyou can live in my castle!
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha...\nOh, “absolutely must," huh...\c\nYou're really selfish...\c\nBut, I agree...\c\nI'll go with you!\nI'll help you win!\c\nI'll make myself small,\nso put me in your pocket!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ah ha ha!\nHey! That tickles!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)] escaped\nfrom the magic cage along with\r\nthe Plush Toy gatekeeper.\c\nShe's learned to be a little kinder\nand become much stronger.\r\nShe should be able to overcome\r\nher final obstacle.

Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Quiet, you!\nI don't need compliments like that!\c\nWhat do you mean working?\nWhat is she going to make me do?
Plush Toy: What will you do?\nThere's a pile of things to do.\c\nCooking, laundry, cleaning...\nEven that is really hard work.\c\nYou also have to take care of\nthings like that door you were fighting.\r\nThey are her pets!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Uwagh!\nThat sounds like such a pain.\c\nThat's the kind of work\nfor a servant!\r\nNot for a prince!
Plush Toy: Come on now...\nLife isn't that easy.\r\nYou are so spoiled.\c\nMaybe a person like you\nshould have been caught...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Whaaa!\nFather! Mother!\r\nMinister! Servants!\r\nSomebody! Save meee!
And so Prince [VAR 0100(0001)],\nshaking with fear about his\r\nwork in the morning, finally\r\nfell asleep.\c\nHe kept telling himself that\nat least he was still alive...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I've been beaten...
Plush Toy: Awww...\nWhat a shame...\c\nBaaad stuff's going to happen to you...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?!
Plush Toy: Those who lose\nto the magic door...\c\n...\c\nThey are turned into doors by the\nmagic that was cast on that door!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey!\nWhat?
Plush Toy: It's just as I said--you're\ngoing to change into a door.\c\nSince you're a prince, I'm sure it's\ngoing to be an ornate door with\r\nlots of gorgeous decorations...\r\nI bet you'll fetch a good price...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: This is terrible!\nI don't want to become a door!\c\nEach and every single day!\nShutting and closing.\r\nShutting and closing.\r\nThat's all I'd ever do!\r\nI can't stand it!
Plush Toy: ...\c\nSo you never plan\non opening, then?\c\nWell, enjoy being able to\nmake dumb jokes while you can...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
And so Prince [VAR 0100(0001)],\nwho lost to the black door,\r\nbecame a door himself.\c\nSurely, he's working as the door\nto some house now...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, Plush Toy.\nIsn't it OK now?\r\nWould you just give me a hint already?
Plush Toy: Like I said, I'm the gatekeeper!\nI can't!\c\nAnd what's more--there is no hint!\c\nEven if you somehow manage to get out,\nyou're going to end up a servant.\c\nThere's no way you can get away\nfrom Bellelba in her own world!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Who cares!\c\nI hate just sitting here quietly\nlocked up in this cage!\c\nA dark, damp place like this isn't\nsuitable for a royal prince\r\nlike myself, now is it?
Plush Toy: Sure... Whatever...\c\nYour pride is a little repulsive,\nbut I feel like you've got some guts.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm gonna do it!\c\nI'm going to break down that door!\nI'll put my pride as a prince at stake!
Plush Toy: You're sure fired up...\nIf you're that excited, you might\r\nbe able to make something work. Maybe...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: But you know what...\nThis is just too much work for me...\r\nI don't care about the stupid door anymore.\c\nHey, Plush Toy.\nI'll give you my allowance.\r\nWould you please let me out?
Plush Toy: Really?! That's your plan?\c\nBribing me? I tell you...\nIf you're the prince of a country,\r\nhumanity's future is looking pretty dark.\c\nFirst of all, I'm a Plush Toy.\nWhat am I supposed to do with money?!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: You shabby reject!\c\nFor a stupid Plush Toy,\nyou've sure got a mouth!\c\nWhatever! I don't need you!\nI'll break it myself!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey...\nWhy were you caught?
Plush Toy: Um...\nI don't really remember...\c\nI'm sure it was a reason\nsimilar to yours though.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...\c\nYou've sure had it hard\nfor a Plush Toy.\r\nThat's why you're worn out and filthy...
Plush Toy: That's too much!\c\nAnd I wasn't born a Plush Toy, you know?!\c\nI used to be a person,\njust like you.\c\nBellelba's spell changed me into this,\nand I have to be the gatekeeper forever...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's terrible!\nWhy don't you run away?
Plush Toy: I know...\nI would like to, but...\c\nUnlike you, I don't have a Pokémon.\c\nAlso, my body is made of cotton,\nso I don't move very well.\c\nI don't really know how I\ncould get away from Bellelba!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't care...
Plush Toy: Y-you're really cold...\c\nWhat's the deal? You were the one\nwho asked about me in the first place...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Flee with me!
Plush Toy: Are you serious?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: How hopeless...
Plush Toy: Well, it's OK.\nYour sympathy won't help me.\r\nIt's not like it's your problem.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\nIt looks like it will break\r\nafter just a little more!
Plush Toy: ...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's wrong?\c\nAre you worried because\nI might get away?
Plush Toy: ...So...about the door...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What about it?
Plush Toy: You can't just break\nthat door with force...\c\nWhen it looks like the door\nis just about to break,\r\nyou need to surprise it...\c\nIf you do that,\nit will run away without being broken...\c\nThat's the only way\nto get it out of the way.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\nWhy did you tell me this?\c\nYou're the gatekeeper, right?\nWasn't that the last hint\r\na few minutes ago?
Plush Toy: I am the gatekeeper...\c\nBut...\nYou invited me to run away with you, right?\c\nAnd even though you're grumbling,\nyou don't give up and keep working!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you!\nWe'll get out together, for sure!
Plush Toy: Hmmm...\nYou're better than I suspected.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff... Puff...\nI did it... The door's gone...
Plush Toy: Looks like it...\nBut you still can't leave...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What's that mean?\nIf I break the door, I can get out!
Plush Toy: Heh heh heh...\nYou DID break the door,\r\nbut the gatekeeper's still here!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I see.\nOK, Plush Toy! Out of the way!\r\nIf you get in my way, I'll turn you into\r\nscraps of cloth and fluff balls!
Plush Toy: Oh. Big talk...\c\nI don't know what's gonna happen to you\nif you think I'm just a ball of fluff!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Bring it on!\nI don't even need a Pokémon\r\nagainst a Plush Toy like you!\c\nI'll pulverize you with the prince-fu\nI developed!
Plush Toy: Bring it on...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Try on my\nprince jump-kick for size!
Plush Toy: Ha...\nToo slow...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)] broke the door of the\nmagic cage, but a Plush Toy stood in front\r\nof the celebrating prince, blocking the way.\c\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)] attacked, but the\nblow was not enough to stop the Plush Toy.\c\nThe Plush Toy found an opening and brought\ndown Prince [VAR 0100(0001)] in an instant...
Plush Toy: Whoa! What a surprise!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?!\nWhat's that all of the sudden?
Plush Toy: That Plush Toy...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Oh, this?\nThe toy used for Substitute?\c\nNow that you mention it,\nit does look just like you...
Plush Toy: It sure does...\c\nBut, well, I didn't always look like this.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Really?\c\nOh! Could it be?!\nMy older brother went missing.\r\nCould you be him?!
Plush Toy: Ha ha... I doubt it.\c\nBut, since I've been in this world,\nI've kept forgetting about the past,\r\nso who knows?\r\nWhat was his name anyway?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Um...\nI think it was Kevin, or something like that?\c\nMy father and mother don't want to\ntalk about it, so...\c\nThe only reason I heard about the\nname was the minister told me in secret.
Plush Toy: Kevin...\nHm... I see...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Well, regardless...\c\nI hope you return to your old self someday!
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha...\c\n(...I see... [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nYou sure got big fast...)
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha!\c\nYou surprised the black door,\nand it ran away!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I did it!\nThe door's gone!\c\nEverything went as planned, right?
Plush Toy: Looks like it...\nOK, get going then!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What are you saying?\nYou're coming with me!\r\nWe're running away together!\c\nIf I get away while you stay here, as\nthe gatekeeper, you'll be punished, right?
Plush Toy: But...\nEven if we get away,\r\nI don't have anywhere to go...\c\nEven if I leave the cage,\nit's the magic world...\c\nBellelba will catch me\nand wipe me out!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I know that!\nWe can't leave like this!\r\nWe have to do something about Bellelba!\c\nThat's why I will definitely need\nyour advice!\c\nSo you absolutely must\ncome with me!\c\nIf we make it back to our own world,\nyou can live in my castle!
Plush Toy: Ha ha ha...\nOh, “absolutely must," huh...\c\nYou're really selfish...\c\nBut, I agree...\c\nI'll go with you!\nI'll help you win!\c\nI'll make myself small,\nso put me in your pocket!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ah ha ha!\nHey! That tickles!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)] escaped\nfrom the magic cage along with\r\nthe Plush Toy gatekeeper.\c\nHe's learned to be a little kinder\nand become much stronger.\r\nHe should be able to overcome\r\nhis final obstacle.

Bellelba: Tch! This is bad.\nThe world's coming apart.\r\nMy energy must be close to gone, too.\c\nI have to consume this\nchild's life force soon, or...
Bellelba: Tch! You!\nHow did you get out of the cage?\c\nMy Plush Toy should have\nbeen keeping an eye on you!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh! That thing?\nI gave it one little slap,\r\nand it ran away crying...\c\nPlush Toy: H-hey...\nMy reputation!\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Shhh...\nDon't talk!\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: More importantly,\nI'm going back to my world!
Bellelba: Hm...\nThis could be fun.\c\nWell, if you can go back,\nyou should go, then.\c\nHere, look at this.\nIt's the door you came through.\r\nIf you break it, maybe you can go back\r\nto your own world?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Another door?\c\nBut if that's the door I came through...\nI might be able to get out if I win!
Bellelba: Eee hee hee!\nGive it a try!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: OK!\nI'll shatter it for sure!\r\nWhat's important is...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Strategy!
Bellelba: Ha ha ha!\nWhat does a child with\r\nno experience know?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Cuteness!
Bellelba: Quit goofing around!\c\nThere's no doubt that I'm\nway cuter than you!
Plush Toy: Hey! [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThere are two doors!\r\nAnd the one you came through\r\nwas the white door, wasn't it?\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's true...\c\nPlush Toy: I would wait on defeating\nthe white door and focus on\r\nthe black door first.\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I see!\nWe have to leave that door\r\nso we can go back though it!
Bellelba: Oh my...\nWhy are you standing there\r\nmuttering to yourself?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I was just coming\nup with a plan!
Bellelba: Eee hee hee!\nTalking to yourself is a sign of trouble.\r\nLonely people talk to themselves, right?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Aaaah! Yeeesh!\nI'll say it again...\r\nI'm definitely the cuter one!\c\nI mean, c'mon, I'm a princess!\nI was born into the top rank. My lineage\r\nand my upbringing were completely different!\c\nAnyway, how old are you?\nYou're not the age where people\r\nshould be calling you cute!\c\nOnly teenagers like me\nshould be called cute!
Bellelba: Aaaa!\nThat's enough from you!\c\nI'm a magic queen who got where\nI am through hard work!\r\nOf course I'm cuter and more admirable\r\nthan some spoiled little princess!\c\nSo your selling point is your youth?\nDon't make me laugh!\r\nYou'll be called “lady" soon enough.\c\nBy the time you're my age,\na layabout like you won't be\r\nanything more than an obnoxious,\r\nbrash, and ordinary old lady.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?!
Bellelba: Got a problem with that?!
Plush Toy: Sheesh...\nTwo sides of the same coin...\r\nMan, they're obnoxious...\c\nI don't even care anymore.\nI'm just a Plush Toy.\r\nGuess I'll just follow whoever wins...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, Bellelba!\nWhy did you make those doors anyway?
Bellelba: Well...\nI suppose I could tell you.\c\nThey're devices to connect the\nmagical world to your world.\c\nMany people wander into this\nworld through those doors...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I see...\nThen what happens to them?\c\nDo you lock them up like you did to me?
Bellelba: That's right.\c\nAnd then their life energy\nis sucked up just by their\r\nbeing in this world.\c\nThen this life extract is\npoured into me.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?
Bellelba: The people whose life energy\nis drained forget about trying to escape,\r\nand they follow my every command...\c\nSoon, the balance between the two\nworlds will reverse,\r\nand there will be no one left\r\nto stand up to me... Ha ha ha...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be...\nI never would've imagined those\r\ndoors would have such terrible power...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Unforgivable!
Bellelba: Whatever.\c\nI'm free to do whatever\nI choose, am I not?\c\nMore importantly, you should remember\nthat your life energy is being drained\r\nwhile you stand here talking to me!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm scared...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee hee!\nThat's right! Be more afraid!\r\nTremble before me!\c\nIf you don't, it's no fun for me!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Amazing!
Bellelba: Isn't it?\c\nIt's a perfect plan befitting\na magic queen like me!
White Door: Claaaang!\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Th-the white door!\nI broke it, but...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee hee...\nIt looks like you noticed...\c\nThat white door was the one\nyou went through to get here.\r\nBreaking it means that...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't go back?
Bellelba: Ah ha ha ha! That's right!\nYou can only leave this world from\r\nthe door you came in through.\c\nI can't even do anything about that rule,\nand I'm the one who made the doors!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's...\nCome on, Plush Toy!\r\nIsn't there anything we can do?\c\nPlush Toy: N-no...\nNot even I can do anything...\r\nWhat to do...\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: S-so,\nwe can't leave this place?
Bellelba: Too bad for you,\nmy dear Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nI guess I'll just have you work\nfor me forever!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: And I got\nthis far...
And so Princess [VAR 0100(0001)],\nwho'd put everything on the line to escape,\r\nmet a sad fate.\c\nNo one knows what happened to\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)] after that...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff...\nPuff... Phew...\c\nPlush Toy: Wh-what's wrong?\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: For some\nreason, I'm in a lot of pain...
Bellelba: Hee hee hee...\nYou've been in this world too long.\r\nFeeling weak, my dear?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not it!
Bellelba: Oh, but I'm afraid it is.\c\nAnyone who enters this world\nhas their power stolen...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not it!\nThis isn't an issue of strength!\c\nIt's an issue of how I feel!
Bellelba: What?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, Plush Toy!\c\nPlush Toy: H-hey!\nDon't talk to me!
Bellelba: YOU!\nYou're the Plush Toy gatekeeper!
Plush Toy: Heh heh! Hi there...\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Stop it!\nDon't talk to the queen!\c\nBecause, I...\nWhile we were together...\r\nI developed a crush on you!\c\nPlush Toy: What?!
Bellelba: Huh?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Plush Toy...\nYou're Bellelba's servant,\r\nand you have to be here, right?\c\nThen if I have to stay here and not go\nhome to my castle, I'll stay here with you!\c\nPlush Toy: Huh?\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Bellelba!\nYou don't have any complaints about\r\nthat, do you?
Bellelba: Well...\nIf you two are OK with that...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Great!\nIt's not a problem! Right, Plush Toy?\c\nPlush Toy: Um, OK.\nIf you're fine being with a ball of fluff\r\nlike me, I guess it's OK...
Bellelba: ...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Yay! Let's have\na happy life together, Plush Toy!
Bellelba: C-congratulations?
Plush Toy: Heh... Ha ha...\nThanks...
And so Princess [VAR 0100(0001)] and the\nPlush Toy were brought together.\c\nTheir love was greater than\nthe difference between flesh and cotton,\r\nand they lived happily ever after...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: So strong...\nI don't know if I can do it.\r\nAnd I've come this far, too...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee!\nToo bad!\c\nWell then! It's back to the\ncage for you, then!\r\nThis time I'll assign\r\nmore guards to you!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm never\ngoing to give up!\r\nI'll keep running out!\c\nI still have [VAR 0102(0000)] with me!
Bellelba: Oh, sooo scary!\nWell then, I'll just have to take\r\ncare of your [VAR 0102(0000)] for you.\c\nWith a little magic, it might make\na nice table or chair!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: No way!\nLeave [VAR 0102(0000)] out of this!
Bellelba: Eee hee hee...\nYou really are a fool.\c\nYou always say one word too many\nor get tripped up!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Sniff...\nI should've listened to Father\r\nand just been good...
And so Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]'s escape\nattempt came to an end...\c\nNo one knows what happened to\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)] and [VAR 0102(0000)]\r\nafter that...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Do you trap people\nin this world and do mean things to\r\nthem because you hate them?
Bellelba: Not really...\nI just want the life energy\r\nthat living things have.\c\nI just use humans as a basic\nmaterial to extract it from.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's terrible...\nUsing people like things...
Bellelba: Oh really.\nLike your father doesn't\r\nuse his people?\c\nThat's what kings do.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: You're wrong!\c\nFather always spoke very\nhighly of the people in the kingdom!\c\nKings exist for the people!\nPeople aren't there for the king!\c\nIt's completely different from you!\c\nBut, I just now understood the meaning\nof my father's words...
Bellelba: Hm...\nSay whatever you'd like.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Father!\nFather!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll do it!
Bellelba: You're still not giving up?\nWell, give it your best shot.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: His name was?
Bellelba: You're an amazingly\ndumb princess...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: And Mother!
Bellelba: What is with you?\nMuttering to yourself over there!\c\nDon't you even understand the\nsituation you're in?
Black Door: Claaaang!\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: I did it!\nI defeated the black door!\c\nPlush Toy: All right!
Bellelba: Eeeeeaaaaaugh!\nThat's impossible!\c\nAh... Uuugggh...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Wh-what's happening?\c\nPlush Toy: Bellelba put all of her\nmagic power into that door.\c\nWhen the door was broken,\nit hurt her as well.
Bellelba: It hurts...\nThis shouldn't...\r\nhave been...possible...
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Bellelba disappeared!\c\nPlush Toy: That means this world\nwill disappear soon, too...\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: What should we do?\c\nPlush Toy: Open the remaining\nwhite door and go inside.\r\nIt should connect to the other world!\c\nPrincess [VAR 0100(0001)]: OK! Let's go home!\nTo our own world!
...\c\nAnd so Princess [VAR 0100(0001)] safely\nreturned to her own world...\c\nThe experiences Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]\nhad in the magical world\r\nmade her much more mature.\c\nLater, Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]\nbecame the queen and reigned\r\nover an era of peace and prosperity...
Bellelba: Ah! You're so stubborn!\c\nWould you just give up already?
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ummm...
Bellelba: Enough already...\nThey say home is where you hang your hat.\c\nI'm sure you'll get used to\nliving in a dark, damp cage!
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: Not yet!
Bellelba: Just give it up already!\nI want to go home and\r\ntake off my makeup...\c\nIf you wear it too long,\nit's bad for the condition\r\nof your skin, you know.
Princess [VAR 0100(0001)]: You give up!
Bellelba: I'm so sorry,\nbut I can't do that!\c\nIf I don't absorb some energy\nfrom a young person,\r\nI won't be able to get rid of the wrinkles\r\nor the bags under my eyes...

Bellelba: Aaaa!\nThat's enough from you!\c\nI'm a magic queen who got where\nI am through hard work!\r\nOf course I'm more admirable and cooler\r\nthan some spoiled little prince!\c\nAnd what's more, if all you get\nfrom the fanciest kind of upbringing\r\nis idiots like you, then it's just\r\na waste of money!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What did you say?!
Bellelba: Got a problem with it?!
Plush Toy: Sheesh...\nTwo sides of the same coin...\r\nMan, they're obnoxious...\c\nI don't even care anymore.\nI'm just a Plush Toy.\r\nGuess I'll just follow whoever wins...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey, Bellelba!\nWhat did you make those doors for anyway?
Bellelba: Well...\nI suppose I could tell you.\c\nThey're devices to connect the\nmagical world to your world.\c\nMany people wander into this\nworld through those doors...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I see...\nThen what happens to them?\c\nDo you lock them up like you did to me?
Bellelba: That's right.\c\nAnd then their life energy\nis sucked up just by their\r\nbeing in this world.\c\nThen this life extract is\npoured into me.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What?
Bellelba: The people whose life energy\nis drained forget about trying to escape,\r\nand they follow my every command...\c\nSoon, the balance between the two\nworlds will reverse,\r\nand there will be no one left\r\nto stand against me... Ha ha ha...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be...\nI never would've imagined those\r\ndoors would have such terrible power...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Unforgivable!
Bellelba: Whatever.\c\nI'm free to do whatever\nI choose, am I not?\c\nMore importantly, you should remember\nthat your life energy is being drained\r\nwhile you stand here talking to me!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm scared...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee hee!\nThat's right! Be more afraid!\r\nTremble before me!\c\nIf you don't, it's no fun for me!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Amazing!
Bellelba: Isn't it?\c\nIt's a perfect plan befitting\na magic queen like me!
White Door: Claaaang!\c\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Th-the white door!\nI broke it, but...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee hee...\nIt looks like you noticed...\c\nThat white door was the one\nyou went through to get here.\r\nBreaking it means that...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I can't go back?
Bellelba: Ah ha ha ha! That's right!\nYou can only leave this world from\r\nthe door you came in through.\c\nI can't even do anything about that rule,\nand I'm the one who made the doors!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's...\nCome on, Plush Toy!\r\nIsn't there anything we can do?\c\nPlush Toy: N-no...\nNot even I can do anything...\r\nWhat to do...\c\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)]: S-so,\nwe can't leave this place?
Bellelba: Too bad for you,\nmy dear Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nI guess I'll just have you work\nfor me forever!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: And I got\nthis far...
And so Prince [VAR 0100(0001)],\nwho'd put everything on the line to escape,\r\nmet a sad fate.\c\nNo one knows what happened to\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)] after that...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Huff...\nPuff... Phew...\c\nPlush Toy: Wh-what's wrong?\c\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)]: For some\nreason, I'm in a lot of pain...
Bellelba: Hee hee hee...\nYou've been in this world too long.\r\nFeeling weak, my dear?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not it!
Bellelba: Oh, but I'm afraid it is.\c\nAnyone who enters this world\nhas their power stolen...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's not it!\nThis isn't an issue of strength!\c\nIt's an issue of how I feel!
Bellelba: What?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Bellelba!\c\nI mean, Ms. Bellelba!
Bellelba: ...?!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I...\nWhile we were fighting,\r\nI grew to love you!\c\nPlush Toy: What?!
Bellelba: What?\nHuh? Ah?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Bellelba!\nI want to live here forever!\c\nNo! I want to be with you!\nPlease, don't deny my feelings!\c\nBellelba! I love you!
Bellelba: What's this all of a sudden?\c\nFirst of all, our ages are too far apart...\c\nEven though my beauty is overwhelming,\nI'm going to be 108 years old this year.\r\nI'll be an old lady in a little bit.\c\nBut I have been thinking about marriage.\nEveryone will be talking about it.\r\nI don't know if you're my type, either...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: It doesn't matter!\nIf we have love, we'll be fine!\r\nLet's have a happy life together!\c\nPlush Toy: Man, he's sure not\nthinking about the long term...
Bellelba: How bold...\nBut, I don't mind people like that.\c\nFine... Let's start as friends...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's great!\nLet's be happy, Bellelba!\c\nMwa!
Bellelba: Hee hee...
Plush Toy: C-congratulations?
And so Prince [VAR 0100(0001)] and\nBellelba were brought together.\c\nTheir love was greater than\nthe difference in age,\r\nand they lived happily ever after...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: So strong...\nI don't know if I can do it.\r\nAnd I've come this far, too...
Bellelba: Eee hee hee!\nToo bad!\c\nWell then! It's back to the\ncage for you, then!\r\nThis time I'll assign\r\nmore guards to you!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm never\ngoing to give up!\r\nI'll keep running out!\c\nI still have [VAR 0102(0000)] with me!
Bellelba: Oh, sooo scary!\nWell then, I'll just have to take\r\ncare of your [VAR 0102(0000)] for you.\c\nWith a little magic, it might make\na nice table or chair!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: No way!\nLeave [VAR 0102(0000)] out of this!
Bellelba: Eee hee hee...\nYou really are a fool.\c\nYou always say one word too many\nor get tripped up!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Sniff...\nI should've listened to Father\r\nand just been good...
And so Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]'s escape\nattempt came to an end...\c\nNo one knows what happened to\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)] and [VAR 0102(0000)]\r\nafter that...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Do you trap people\nin this world and do mean things to\r\nthem because you hate them?
Bellelba: Not really...\nI just want the life energy\r\nthat living things have.\c\nI just use humans as a basic\nmaterial to extract it from.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: That's terrible...\nUsing people like things...
Bellelba: Oh really.\nLike your father doesn't\r\nuse his people?\c\nThat's what kings do.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: You're wrong!\c\nFather always spoke very\nhighly of the people in the kingdom!\c\nKings exist for the people!\nPeople aren't there for the king!\c\nIt's completely different from you!\c\nBut, I just now understood the meaning\nof my father's words...
Bellelba: Hm...\nSay whatever you'd like.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Father!\nFather!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll do it!
Bellelba: You're still not giving up?\nWell, give it your best shot.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: His name was?
Bellelba: You're an amazingly\ndumb prince...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: And Mother!
Bellelba: What is with you?\nMuttering to yourself over there!\c\nDon't you even understand the\nsituation you're in?
Black Door: Claaaang!\c\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)]: I did it!\nI defeated the black door!\c\nPlush Toy: All right!
Bellelba: Eeeeeaaaaaugh!\nThat's impossible!\c\nAh... Uuugggh...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Wh-what's happening?\c\nPlush Toy: Bellelba put all of her\nmagic power into that door.\c\nWhen the door was broken,\nit hurt her as well.
Bellelba: It hurts...\nThis shouldn't...\r\nhave been...possible...
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Bellelba disappeared!\c\nPlush Toy: That means this world\nwill disappear soon, too...\c\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)]: What should we do?\c\nPlush Toy: Open the remaining\nwhite door and go inside.\r\nIt should connect to the other world!\c\nPrince [VAR 0100(0001)]: OK! Let's go home!\nTo our own world!
...\c\nAnd so Prince [VAR 0100(0001)] safely\nreturned to his own world...\c\nThe experiences Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]\nhad in the magical world\r\nmade him much more mature.\c\nLater, Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]\nbecame the king and reigned\r\nover an era of peace and prosperity...
Bellelba: Ah! You're so stubborn!\c\nWould you just give up already?
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Ummm...
Bellelba: Enough already...\nThey say home is where you hang your hat.\c\nI'm sure you'll get used to\nliving in a dark, damp cage!
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: Not yet!
Bellelba: Just give it up already!\nI want to go home and\r\ntake off my makeup...\c\nIf you wear it too long,\nit's bad for the condition\r\nof your skin, you know.
Prince [VAR 0100(0001)]: You give up!
Bellelba: I'm so sorry,\nbut I can't do that!\c\nIf I don't absorb some energy\nfrom a young person,\r\nI won't be able to get rid of the wrinkles\r\nor the bags under my eyes...

Mystery Man
River: You're quite stubborn...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Arrrgh!\nPlease give up already!
River: Why do you care?\c\nFor you, it's just some kind of Poké Ball.
???: Excuse me...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Who are you?
???: My name is River.\c\nI sold you a Poké Ball the other day.\c\nDo you have a minute?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Er...\c\nI'm sorry.\nI'm busy right now.
River: I see.\nThen I'll get right to the point.\c\nThat Poké Ball I sold you...\c\nI need you to give it back.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Uh, why?
River: ...\c\nThere was a small slipup, that's all.\nMind you, I'm not asking to get it\r\nback for free.\c\nI'll pay whatever price you want.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Well, er...\nI'm sorry. I can't give it back.
River: Truly?\nI'm sorry you won't agree to give it back.\c\nSadly, I have to get it from you anyway...\nBy force, if I have to!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?
River: Again, sorry...\c\nIt's not your fault, but I have no choice.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh? You mean--violence?
River: I know, I know, and I'm sorry.\nBut it just cannot be helped...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No way!\nWhat have I done to deserve this?
River: Apologies all over again...\c\nBut...\nI must get that Poké Ball back at any cost!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's totally unfair!\nBesides, no matter how much you want it,\r\nthe Poké Ball was...
River: W-was? What happened?\c\nDid you...\nHave you...used that Poké Ball already?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Well...er...
River: No matter.\c\nWhatever happened,\nI'll get that Poké Ball back!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It opened all by itself!
River: Opened all by itself...\nThat's what I was afraid of...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It wasn't me!
River: What are you talking about?\nThere's no one else here.\c\nNow stop making trouble and\ngive the Poké Ball back to me!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Never mind! No way!
River: Talk, don't talk... I don't care!\nBut I'm getting that Poké Ball back!
River: Urk...\nYou're quite good...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hfff, hfff...\c\nWhew! Enough!\c\nI can't give you the Poké Ball back!\c\nSo please leave now!
River: I am sorry, but I cannot leave.\c\nI wish I didn't have to go this far, but...
Wham!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Eek!
River: I apologize.\c\nBut I cannot permit the existence of\nthis Poké Ball to be made public!
...I was attacked by a man\nwho identified himself as River...\c\nI lost consciousness...\c\n...When I regained consciousness,\nthe man had disappeared\r\nand the Poké Ball was gone.\c\nOn the table in its place, there was\na pile of money I'd never seen before...\c\nMy big sister's inside the Poké Ball...\nOh, what will happen to her?
River: Apologies.\nI didn't want to get rough with you, but...

River: You're quite stubborn...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Arrrgh!\nPlease give up already!
River: Why do you care?\c\nFor you, it's just some kind of Poké Ball.
???: Excuse me...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Who are you?
???: My name is River.\c\nI sold you a Poké Ball the other day.\c\nDo you have a minute?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Er...\c\nI'm sorry.\nI'm busy right now.
River: I see.\nThen I'll get right to the point.\c\nThat Poké Ball I sold you...\c\nI need you to give it back.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Uh, why?
River: ...\c\nThere was a small slipup, that's all.\nMind you, I'm not asking to get it\r\nback for free.\c\nI'll pay whatever price you want.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Well, er...\nI'm sorry. I can't give it back.
River: Truly?\nI'm sorry you won't agree to give it back.\c\nSadly, I have to get it from you anyway...\nBy force, if I have to!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?
River: Again, sorry...\c\nIt's not your fault, but I have no choice.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh? You mean--violence?
River: I know, I know, and I'm sorry.\nBut it just cannot be helped...

River: Apologies all over again...\c\nBut...\nI must get that Poké Ball back at any cost!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's totally unfair!\nBesides, no matter how much you want it,\r\nthe Poké Ball was...
River: W-was? What happened?\c\nDid you...\nHave you...used that Poké Ball already?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Well...er...
River: No matter.\c\nWhatever happened,\nI'll get that Poké Ball back!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It opened all by itself!
River: Opened all by itself...\nThat's what I was afraid of...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It wasn't me!
River: What are you talking about?\nThere's no one else here.\c\nNow stop making trouble and\ngive the Poké Ball back to me!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Never mind! No way!
River: Talk, don't talk... I don't care!\nBut I'm getting that Poké Ball back!
River: Urk...\nYou're quite good...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hfff, hfff...\c\nWhew! Enough!\c\nI can't give you the Poké Ball back!\c\nSo please leave now!

Even as Monica and I smiled at each other,\nMr. River interrupted with a sudden shout.\c\nHe said the Poké Ball my sister was in\npopped and broke.\c\nBefore my eyes, Monica's body became\nsmaller, smaller, and smaller...
A curse...a power of the mind...\c\nI don't understand any of\nwhat Mr. River said...\c\nBut my sister is my family...\nThat's something you just can't replace!\c\nAnd as she returned to her proper size,\nI threw myself into my sister's arms.
Monica: Sigh...\c\nThat's enough... I'm tired...\nI'm tired of everything--\c\nYou who made me like this,\nthis world, and everything...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: M-Monica...
Monica: Farewell, [VAR 0100(0001)].\nI'll never see you again.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Monica, wait...\nWhere are you going?
Monica: It doesn't matter...\nSomewhere where there's nobody else...\c\nBecause I'm no longer a human.
With those words, Monica turned her back\nand vanished into the distant sea...\c\n...\c\nSince then, 10 years have passed.\nI'm still searching for my sister...\c\nAh, Monica...\c\nI wonder where you are...\nI wonder what you're doing now...
Monica: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nUgh... It hurts...\c\n...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sorry...\c\nSorry, Monica...\nI couldn't think of any other way...
River: Hey... She lost consciousness.\c\nWhat are you doing?\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\c\nWell, Mr. River...\c\nPlease give the Poké Ball\nback to me now...
River: No. Impossible.\c\nShe's too dangerous. And this Poké Ball\nis too dangerous for this world...\c\nI cannot give it back to you.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Mr. River, listen carefully.\c\nWhatever my sister's fate is...\nI intend to share it.\c\nIf you don't give me that Poké Ball now,\nI'll get it...\r\nEven if I have to take it by force.
River: You...\c\nYou think you can threaten me?\c\nLet me enlighten you...\nI'm a secret agent.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I've made up my mind, Mr. River.\c\nNo matter what happens,\nI'm staying at my sister's side...
River: I understand.\nI won't try and stop you.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Thank you.
River: What do you plan to do now?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Well...\c\nAs long as I'm with my sister,\nit doesn't matter where we go...together...\c\nThis is good-bye, Mr. River.
River: ...
I am a secret agent--code name: River.\nI am responsible for a most enormous error.\c\nI allowed a very dangerous creature and a\nvery dangerous object--neither of which\r\nshould exist in this world--to escape.\c\nHaving taken the entire responsibility for\ntheir escape, I have resigned my post as\r\na secret agent.
Since then, 10 years have passed...\c\nBut there have been no reports about\nthe gigantic woman since that day.\c\nI wonder what happened to those two...
Monica: To begin with, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nWhy did you set your Pokémon on me?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I had no choice. It's terrible.\c\nBut there was nothing else I could do.
Monica: [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: When you're in pain,\nI can't do anything but rely on my Pokémon.\r\nI'm disappointed in myself, too!\c\nBut there was nothing I could do!\nI didn't know what else to do!
Monica: All right...\nIt's OK, [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Monica...
Monica: Hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nDo you remember this beach?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Huh?
Monica: You don't remember, do you...\nOf course, you were still pretty little.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: When was it?
Monica: When our mom and dad were healthy.\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], you saw the ocean\nfor the first time that day...\c\nYou couldn't swim yet, but you were so\nexcited and kept going into the ocean\r\nwhenever Mom and Dad took their eyes\r\noff you for a moment.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Really?\c\nI don't remember it at all.
Monica: I jumped in and swam to you\nand grabbed your hand.\c\nYou were halfway drowned already!\c\nBut you were smiling and having\nsuch a good time.\c\nI found myself laughing.\nYou were just a carefree kid.\r\nYou had no idea how scared I felt about you.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I see...
Monica: I feel nostalgic.\c\nAh...\nI wonder if I'll ever be able to play\r\nwith you like that again...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Monica...
Monica: Oh, me! Ohhhh, my!\nI knew it. I'm still a giant.\c\nTell me, [VAR 0100(0001)]...\nAm I gonna be this way forever?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Might as well give up.
Monica: Ohhhhh, wait!\nAre you gonna give up so easily?\c\nYou're my boyfriend!\nDon't you care what happens to me?\c\nThink of something so I can be normal again!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'll get it sorted out!
Monica: Oh, please think fast!\nI can't go on living like this.\r\nI'll die of shame!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: OK, first? Calm down.
Monica: I know.\c\nBut I can't help worrying.\nI'm scared of what I might do!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Mr. River, how can\nwe get Monica back to normal?
River: We need a way to lift the curse\non that miserable Poké Ball...\c\nLet me think...\c\nAt its core, a curse is a power of the mind.\c\nSo, if you could show a power of the mind\nwith more strength than the curse\r\naffecting the Poké Ball...\r\nSurely, then, she will...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: A power of the mind?
River: Yes.\c\nWhat I mean is something like\na very strong feeling for her...\r\nLike a strong feeling of love...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...\nYou may be the only one who can do this...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
Monica: Grrrr! Agggggghh!\n[VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nThis whole thing is your fault!\nFrom the very start!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm sorry...
Monica: You're always saying sorry...\nBut do you truly feel sorry?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Is that what you think?
Monica: Are you even paying attention?\c\nThis all happened because you bought\nthat strange Poké Ball in the first place!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Now, don't get upset.
Monica: Of course I'm upset!\nI'm upset you got me into this mess!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Aww...\c\n(...What should I do now?...)\c\n(...Somehow, I need to show\nthe strength of my love...)\c\n(...But Monica won't listen if\nI just say words...)
Monica: Hey! [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nAre you spacing out?\c\nAre you going to help me?! Yes or no!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I just don't know...
Monica: What? You don't know?!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]... I get it.\nI'm just a pain in the neck to you\r\nbecause of what I've become...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm thinking, but...
Monica: What do you mean, “but"?\nBut what?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: But--I'm thinking!
Monica: [VAR 0100(0001)].\nThinking, talking, anything!\c\nWhen it comes to doing--nothing!\c\nYour words say nothing!\nYour actions say it all!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Monica...
Monica: Ehhhhk!\n[VAR 0100(0001)], you're all words and no action!\c\nMy life is over!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: MONICA!!
Monica: Don't yell at me, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nEven though I'm so big,\nyou don't have to be so loud!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Monica!\c\nPlease...\c\nJust listen to what I'm going to say!
Monica: What?\c\nI guess I'll have this enormous body\nfor the rest of my life...\r\nLiving forever as a monster!\c\nJust...touching the person I love,\nI'll crush him.\c\nI'm a monster--a piteous monster!\nI can't get married like this!\c\nWhat I'm saying, [VAR 0100(0001)], is...\nYou don't want to be with a monster woman\r\nlike me, do you?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Not...true...
Monica: All right, enough.\nI...hate...everyone!!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]!\nI don't want to see your face anymore!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Monica! Knock it off!!
Monica: [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Now, listen! Monica!\nI'm not going to change!\c\nEven if you stay the size you are now,\nit makes no difference!\c\nI love you whatever size you are,\nand I'll be at your side forever!
Monica: [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh, Monica...
Monica: [VAR 0100(0001)]...
Even as Monica and I smiled at each other,\nMr. River interrupted with a sudden shout.\c\nHe said the Poké Ball my girlfriend was in\npopped and broke.\c\nBut Monica's body didn't go back\nto normal all at once...
...\c\nAs the seasons passed, she grew smaller,\nlittle by little...\c\nLiving with the giant-sized Monica sometimes\nbrought trouble along with it,\r\nbut I never let it bother me...\c\nEventually, after I had become an old man\nand Monica had become an old woman,\r\nour heights finally became the same...
Monica: Sigh...\c\nThat's enough... I'm tired...\nI'm tired of everything--\c\nYou who made me like this,\nthis world, and everything...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: M-Monica...

Monica: [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nUgh... It hurts...\c\n...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sorry...\c\nSorry, Monica...\nI couldn't think of any other way...
River: Hey... She lost consciousness.\c\nWhat are you doing?\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Monica: I knew it. You don't remember.\n[VAR 0100(0001)], this is how you always are.\c\nSame now as then. That was the\nfirst time in my life that I wore a bikini,\r\nbut, [VAR 0100(0001)], you didn't even notice.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Now I remember!\c\nYou were pretty mad that day, too!
Monica: Well, duh!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]. I'd been putting a lot of\neffort into dieting so I could wear it, just\r\nbecause I wanted you to say I'm pretty...\c\nBut you didn't even notice.\nI was frustrated.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Sorry...
Monica: Oh, well.\nWe had a good time that day, anyway.\c\nI wonder if we'll be able to have fun\nlike that again...

Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThe test is almost complete!\c\nI'm going to turn off the power\nto the F-00!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: So this day has\nfinally come...
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nToday is the day when all our hard\nwork finally pays off!\c\nThe birth of an all-new robot, programmed\nto have a human heart...or as close to it\r\nas possible!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nLet's begin the final test!\c\nThis test involves communication with\nhumans and with Pokémon!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Very well.\nLet's begin the test.
Assistant: Activating the F-00 now!\nPlease be careful not to damage it!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Quiet, you...\nI know what I'm doing!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Excellent.\nIt appears to be moving properly.
Assistant: OK, let's begin the\nconversational skill test!\c\nTry talking to the F-00!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I know what to do!
F-00: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Good morning.
F-00: GOOD. MORNING.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Come on! Get up!
F-00: WHAT?\nTOO LOUD. BE QUIET.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: OK...\nEverything seems to check out!
F-00: WHO?\c\nWHO ARE YOU?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: My name is [VAR 0100(0001)].\nI'm a friend!
F-00: WHAT IS...FRIEND?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Someone you like!
F-00: [VAR 0100(0001)]! FRIEND!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Someone you know.
F-00: SOMEONE I KNOW... SOMEONE I KNOW...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't really know...
F-00: YOU DO NOT KNOW.\nI DO NOT KNOW, EITHER.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You figure it out!
F-00: I DO NOT UNDERSTAND...\nWHAT IS FRIEND?
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThe F-00 has shut down!\c\nThis concludes the test!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Indeed...
Assistant: Congratulations!\nThe test was a complete success!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Of course it was.\nA genius like myself doesn't fail.
Assistant: Of course you don't!\c\nRegardless, if we can sell the designs for\nthe F-00, our lab may finally be able to get\r\nout of the red! We can finally put an\r\nend to this long slump we've been having!\c\nWe'll be able to start up all kinds of new\nand exciting research!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...\c\nI don't think so...\nI'm not giving up the F-00 to anyone.\c\nI've already disposed of the design data.
Assistant: What? How could you?!\c\nThen...that means this F-00 is the only\none that will ever be made!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's exactly what I'm saying.
Assistant: How could you...\c\nAll this time I spent aiding you\nin your research...for nothing!\r\nWhat are we supposed to do?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I won't give up the F-00\nto anyone.\c\nI invented it. It's my robot!
And so I succeeded in inventing the first\never robot to have a heart...\r\nI completed the F-00...\c\nThe F-00 was the culmination of my years of\nresearch and the crystallization of my\r\nhopes and dreams.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Why...\nWhy won't you move?
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nWhat are you doing?!\c\nYou've destroyed the F-00!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No...\nI went easy on it...
Assistant: It was just meant to be a test!\nI even warned you to be careful\r\nnot to damage the F-00!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...
Assistant: It's all your fault! All of our\nhard work...for nothing!\c\nWhat are we going to do now?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Sniffle...\nWahhh! Wahhh!
Assistant: Oh, pull yourself together.\nCrying won't bring it back.\c\nFor someone who is such a genius,\nyou're still just a kid.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wahh...sniffle...
And so, just before completing\nthe first-ever robot to have a heart,\r\nI accidentally destroyed it...\c\nI made many more attempts after that\nto create another robot, but none were as\r\nmarvelous as my F-00...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey!\nWhat are you doing, F-00?\c\nThe test isn't over yet!\nBe still!
F-00: I AM BORED.\nBORED OF THIS TEST.\c\nTHIS IS NOT FUN.\nI WANT TO HAVE FUN!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], GOOD-BYE!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Just wait a moment!\nWhere do you think you're going?\c\nGoing somewhere to have fun?\nDoes the F-00's programming really allow it\r\nto behave so much like a human?
Assistant: What are you standing there for?\nWe've got to hurry and bring back the F-00!\c\nWe're still in the testing phases! There's\nno telling what the F-00 will do out there!\c\nWhat are you going to do if it gets involved\nin some kind of accident?!
Assistant: Come on, Professor!\nWe've got to hurry!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...
And so we desperately ran after\nthe F-00...\c\nWhen we finally caught up, we saw it\ndestroying everything in its path.\c\nThe F-00 found its fun in destroying the\ntown's buildings and cars.\c\nEventually the police arrived, and the\nF-00 was destroyed...\c\nTaking responsibility for the incident, I\nturned myself in and was arrested.\c\nThat was 20 years ago...\c\nI still regret that I ever created\nsuch a dangerous and violent robot...
F-00: IT HURTS...
Assistant: Professor! What are you doing?!\c\nGo easy on the F-00 or you'll end up\ndestroying it!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I know, I know...\nIt was just a tiny mistake...
Assistant: Please be a bit more careful!\nYou know the future of our laboratory\r\nhangs in the balance!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh, be quiet...
Assistant: Don't tell me to be quiet!\nI only said it because I care about\r\neveryone in our lab...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Who cares?
Assistant: You should care, Professor!\nGive me a break! This is just a prototype!\r\nIf you aren't careful with it, there's\r\nno telling what could happen!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I suppose you're right.
Assistant: I'm counting on you!\nThe F-00 is our lab's only hope!

Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThe test is almost complete!\c\nI'm going to turn off the power\nto the F-00!
Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]: So this day has\nfinally come...
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nToday is the day when all our hard\nwork finally pays off!\c\nThe birth of an all-new robot, programmed\nto have a human heart...or as close to it\r\nas possible!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nLet's begin the final test!\c\nThis test involves communication with\nhumans and with Pokémon!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Very well.\nLet's begin the test.
Assistant: Activating the F-00 now!\nPlease be careful not to damage it!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Quiet, you...\nI know what I'm doing!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Excellent.\nIt appears to be moving properly.
Assistant: OK, let's begin the\nconversational skill test!\c\nTry talking to the F-00!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I know what to do!
F-00: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Good morning.
F-00: GOOD. MORNING.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Come on! Get up!
F-00: WHAT?\nTOO LOUD. BE QUIET.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: OK...\nEverything seems to check out!
F-00: WHO?\c\nWHO ARE YOU?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: My name is [VAR 0100(0001)].\nI'm a friend!
F-00: WHAT IS...FRIEND?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Someone you like!
F-00: [VAR 0100(0001)]! FRIEND!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Someone you know.
F-00: SOMEONE I KNOW... SOMEONE I KNOW...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't really know...
F-00: YOU DO NOT KNOW.\nI DO NOT KNOW, EITHER.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You figure it out!
F-00: I DO NOT UNDERSTAND...\nWHAT IS FRIEND?
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThe F-00 has shut down!\c\nThis concludes the test!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Indeed...
Assistant: Congratulations!\nThe test was a complete success!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Of course it was.\nA genius like myself doesn't fail.
Assistant: Of course you don't!\c\nRegardless, if we can sell the designs for\nthe F-00, our lab may finally be able to get\r\nout of the red! We can finally put an\r\nend to this long slump we've been having!\c\nWe'll be able to start up all kinds of new\nand exciting research!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...\c\nI don't think so...\nI'm not giving up the F-00 to anyone.\c\nI've already disposed of the design data.
Assistant: What? How could you?!\c\nThen...that means this F-00 is the only\none that will ever be made!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's exactly what I'm saying.
Assistant: How could you...\c\nAll this time I spent aiding you\nin your research...for nothing!\r\nWhat are we supposed to do?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I won't give up the F-00\nto anyone.\c\nI invented it. It's my robot!
And so I succeeded in inventing the first\never robot to have a heart...\r\nI completed the F-00...\c\nThe F-00 was the culmination of my years of\nresearch and the crystallization of my\r\nhopes and dreams.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Why...\nWhy won't you move?
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nWhat are you doing?!\c\nYou've destroyed the F-00!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No...\nI went easy on it...
Assistant: It was just meant to be a test!\nI even warned you to be careful\r\nnot to damage the F-00!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ugh...
Assistant: It's all your fault! All of our\nhard work...for nothing!\c\nWhat are we going to do now?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...Sniffle...\nWahhh! Wahhh!
Assistant: Oh, pull yourself together.\nCrying won't bring it back.\c\nFor someone who is such a genius,\nyou're still just a kid.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wahh...sniffle...
And so, just before completing\nthe first-ever robot to have a heart,\r\nI accidentally destroyed it...\c\nI made many more attempts after that\nto create another robot, but none were as\r\nmarvelous as my F-00...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey!\nWhat are you doing, F-00?\c\nThe test isn't over yet!\nBe still!
F-00: I AM BORED.\nBORED OF THIS TEST.\c\nTHIS IS NOT FUN.\nI WANT TO HAVE FUN!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], GOOD-BYE!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Just wait a moment!\nWhere do you think you're going?\c\nGoing somewhere to have fun?\nDoes the F-00's programming really allow it\r\nto behave so much like a human?
Assistant: What are you standing there for?\nWe've got to hurry and bring back the F-00!\c\nWe're still in the testing phases! There's\nno telling what the F-00 will do out there!\c\nWhat are you going to do if it gets involved\nin some kind of accident?!
Assistant: Come on, Professor!\nWe've got to hurry!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hmmm...
And so we desperately ran after\nthe F-00...\c\nWhen we finally caught up, we saw it\ndestroying everything in its path.\c\nThe F-00 found its fun in destroying the\ntown's buildings and cars.\c\nEventually the police arrived, and the\nF-00 was destroyed...\c\nTaking responsibility for the incident, I\nturned myself in and was arrested.\c\nThat was 20 years ago...\c\nI still regret that I ever created\nsuch a dangerous and violent robot...
F-00: IT HURTS...

F-00: FUN! I LIKE FUN!\nWHAT DO WE DO FOR FUN, [VAR 0100(0001)]?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I don't know...\nWhat do you want to do for fun, F-00?
F-00: FUN! FUN! I WANT TO PLAY WITH\n[VAR 0100(0001)] AND POKÉMON!
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nAre you sure you have time to play with\nthe F-00?\c\nWe're pretty backed up with research\nwork, you know...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Don't worry about all that!\c\nThat kind of research can be done by\njust about anyone...\c\nI'm much more interested in filling up F-00's\nmemory by teaching it lots and lots of\r\nnew things...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Come on, F-00!\c\nYou need to give your attacks more oomph\nwhen going up against Pokémon!
F-00: ATTACKS...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's right!\c\nYou've got to use moves on your own, like\na Pokémon! You know what to do!\c\nF-00, you're equipped with a system\nthat lets you use moves, just like\r\na Pokémon does!
F-00: ATTACKS...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What's wrong, F-00?
Assistant: Umm, Professor...\nMaybe the F-00 doesn't want to hurt\r\nits opponents...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Listen to me, F-00.\nPokémon are creatures that just\r\nlove to battle!\c\nTrust me, F-00! You have nothing\nto worry about!
F-00: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Come on! It's fun!
F-00: FUN! FUN!

F-00: ALL RIGHT...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You don't want to?
F-00: DO NOT LIKE...ATTACKS...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What do you think?\nBattling with Pokémon is pretty fun,\r\nisn't it?
F-00: POKÉMON! FUN!\nI LOVE [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hee hee hee...\nWell, thank you, F-00!
F-00: I LOVE [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nDOES [VAR 0100(0001)] LOVE ME?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Of course I do!
F-00: I LOVE [VAR 0100(0001)]!\n[VAR 0100(0001)]! I AM HAVING FUN!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's hard to say...
F-00: NOT LOVE ME...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...MUST HATE ME...\nTHEN I...HATE...[VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Aww, I'm blushing!
F-00: WHAT IS BLUSHING?
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nThe F-00 is just about out of energy...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I guess this ends today's\nsession, then...\c\nI'd better give the F-00 a bigger battery\nso I can spend more time with it.
Assistant: Professor...\c\nWhy are you so particular about the F-00?\c\nI understand that it's your invention and\nthat it's important to you, but don't you\r\nthink you might be taking it a bit too far?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You want to know?
Assistant: Well...yes, that's why I asked.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ever since I was younger, I've\ndone nothing but study, all day every day...\c\nThere's no one in my life I can truly call\na friend...\c\nAnd now I spend my days doing research with\nadults like you...\c\nThe F-00 is the only being in my life that\nI have a chance to play with!
Assistant: I see...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: All right, then...\nLet's stop for today, F-00...
F-00: FUN! FUN!\n[VAR 0100(0001)]! FUN!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Thanks, F-00!\nI'm having fun, too!
F-00: I LOVE [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)] IS MY FRIEND!\nPLAY WITH ME MORE!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm so sorry, F-00!\c\nYour battery is just about to run out...\c\nSo, let's take a break now, OK?
Assistant: Hee hee... Ha ha...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What's so funny?
Assistant: Oh, sorry...\c\nIt's just funny watching the two of you\nplay together. You look so happy!\r\nLike you're siblings or something!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Siblings...
Assistant: Listen! I'm sorry!\nI didn't mean anything bad by it.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Siblings, huh?
It was just as my assistant said.\nThe F-00 had become my friend...\c\nActually, that's not quite right.\nOur relationship was more like that of a\r\nbrother and sister who get along very well.\c\nHowever...\c\nSuch happy days were not meant to last...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00! What's wrong?!
F-00: POKÉmon... FUn...\n[VAR 0100(0001)]... LOve...\c\n...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00! Come back!\nF-00!
Assistant: It's no good...\c\nThe F-00 has stopped functioning\ncompletely... Its circuits appear to have\r\nshorted out.\c\nI'm afraid that its memory has been wiped\nas well. Everything the F-00 has learned\r\nis now gone...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No way! It can't be!\c\nDidn't you back up its memory banks?
Assistant: I'm sorry, Professor...\c\nYou wouldn't ever let me touch the F-00.\nI never had a chance to back up its memory.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be!\c\nI finally succeeded in creating a robot...\nIt was my friend!
I did my best to repair the F-00...\c\nAs a result of my efforts, the F-00 was\nrebuilt as a highly functional robot with\r\ngreat intelligence...\c\nHowever, the kind and playful heart I had\ndiscovered inside my friend did not return\r\nto the new F-00...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Urgh...\c\nWhat incredible strength!
F-00: ATTACK! ATTACK!\n[VAR 0100(0001)], FUN!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Argh...
Assistant: Eek!!\c\nProfessor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nAre you OK?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Guh...ughh...\c\nF-00... You're so strong...
F-00: ATTACK! ATTACK!\n[VAR 0100(0001)], FUN!
Assistant: Professor!\c\nOh no! Someone! Please, help!\nThe F-00 is attacking Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c\nThis robot is simply too dangerous!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Ha ha ha...\c\nCome on... F-00...\nLet's... Let's play some more...\c\nYou... You're...my friend...\c\n...
Assaulted by the over-excited F-00,\nI lost consciousness...\c\nI came to after a while, only to see that\nthe F-00 had been completely dismantled\r\nby my assistants...\c\nI gathered the pieces of scrap that once\nmade up the F-00 and hugged them close\r\nto me as I left the laboratory.\c\nAfter that, I quit robotics research and\nnever attempted to create another one.
F-00: FUN! FUN!\n[VAR 0100(0001)]! POKÉMON, FUN!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's great, F-00...\c\nIt makes me happy to see you having\nso much fun!\c\nBut, we're going to have to stop soon.\nYour battery is about to run out.
F-00: NO! NO!\nI WANT TO PLAY WITH [VAR 0100(0001)] MORE!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Listen to me!
F-00: NO! WANT TO PLAY MORE!\nMORE FUN WITH [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Just be patient...
F-00: SORRY. MADE TROUBLE FOR [VAR 0100(0001)].\nWILL BE PATIENT.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Let's play again later!
F-00: YES! PLAY AGAIN LATER!\nF-00 AND [VAR 0100(0001)], FRIENDS!
F-00: THAT HURTS! OUCH!\n[VAR 0100(0001)]! DON'T HURT ME!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm so sorry!\nDid it really hurt?
F-00: YES...\c\nBUT F-00 IS OK...\nF-00 WON'T CRY!\c\nACTUALLY, F-00 CANNOT CRY!\nSO F-00 IS OK!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: My poor F-00...
F-00: WHAT IS WRONG, [VAR 0100(0001)]?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm so sorry...\c\nWhen you're in pain, or when you're feeling\nsad...when things aren't going well...\r\nIt's very important to be able to cry.\c\nBut I never wanted to see you cry, so I\ndidn't program you with negative feelings...\c\nIt's not just that...\nI didn't want you to become like me...\r\nAlways crying by myself...
F-00: ...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], ALWAYS CRYING?\nWHY? WHY? IS [VAR 0100(0001)] SAD?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I guess you could say that...\nI'm always all alone, so I guess\r\nI feel a little lonely at times...
F-00: NOT ALONE!\nF-00 WITH YOU! F-00, FRIEND!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00...\c\nThat's right... How could I forget that\nI have you by my side...

F-00: NO! NO!\nI WANT TO PLAY WITH [VAR 0100(0001)] MORE!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Listen to me!
F-00: NO! WANT TO PLAY MORE!\nMORE FUN WITH [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Just be patient...
F-00: SORRY. MADE TROUBLE FOR [VAR 0100(0001)].\nWILL BE PATIENT.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Let's play again later!
F-00: YES! PLAY AGAIN LATER!\nF-00 AND [VAR 0100(0001)], FRIENDS!
F-00: THAT HURTS! OUCH!\n[VAR 0100(0001)]! DON'T HURT ME!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm so sorry!\nDid it really hurt?
F-00: YES...\c\nBUT F-00 IS OK...\nF-00 WON'T CRY!\c\nACTUALLY, F-00 CANNOT CRY!\nSO F-00 IS OK!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: My poor F-00...
F-00: WHAT IS WRONG, [VAR 0100(0001)]?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm so sorry...\c\nWhen you're in pain, or when you're feeling\nsad...when things aren't going well...\r\nIt's very important to be able to cry.\c\nBut I never wanted to see you cry, so I\ndidn't program you with negative feelings...\c\nIt's not just that...\nI didn't want you to become like me...\r\nAlways crying by myself...
F-00: ...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], ALWAYS CRYING?\nWHY? WHY? IS [VAR 0100(0001)] SAD?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I guess you could say that...\nI'm always all alone, so I guess\r\nI feel a little lonely at times...
F-00: NOT ALONE!\nF-00 WITH YOU! F-00, FRIEND!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00...\c\nThat's right... How could I forget that\nI have you by my side...

[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey!\nJust what do you think you're doing?!
Assistant: Professor [VAR 0100(0001)]...\c\nNo. You're just [VAR 0100(0001)] to me now.\c\nI'm fed up, and I just can't work with\nyou any longer!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What do you mean?!
Assistant: You're just a kid, but you act\nall high and mighty around here.\c\nRecently, you've just been playing with that\nrobot and ignoring our research.\c\nIf we keep this up, our lab is going to go\nbankrupt, and it's all because of you!\c\nThat's why I took the F-00!\c\nSince you disposed of the design data, I\nhave no choice but to sell the only F-00 we\r\nhave and use that money to save the lab!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You can't be serious!\nThe F-00 is mine and mine alone!\r\nI won't let you or anyone else sell it!
Assistant: You're too late.\c\nThe F-00 won't listen to your\norders anymore!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's nonsense!
Assistant: You'll see.\c\nThis is what you get for always trying\nto make a fool of me!\c\nHey! F-00!\c\nCome over here and teach [VAR 0100(0001)]\na lesson!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It can't be! F-00!\nDon't you recognize me?
F-00: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Something's wrong with F-00!\nWhat did you do to it?!
Assistant: This robot wouldn't listen to my\norders, so I had no choice...\c\nI erased the F-00's memory banks and\nreprogrammed it to obey me!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: How could you?!\c\nThe F-00's programming is\nextremely complex!\r\nIt can't be reprogrammed so easily...\c\nEspecially not by someone with your\nlimited skills!
Assistant: There you go again! Always\ntrying to make a fool of me!\c\nIt's that awful personality of yours\nthat got you in this position!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's just the truth...
Assistant: That may be so, but such\nbluntness can hurt people's feelings!\c\nYou may be a genius, but you can't\neven understand that simple fact?!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You're just jealous...
Assistant: Maybe I am! But I'll teach\nyou to respect your elders!\c\nF-00! Let's do this!\nIt's time to punish [VAR 0100(0001)]!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I'm sorry...
Assistant: It's too late for apologies!\c\nDon't think I'll forgive you that easily!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's my fault...
Assistant: That's right! It's all your fault!\c\nI'm a scientist, too, you know?\nIt's not like I wanted to resort\r\nto dirty tactics like this!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Oh no...\c\nIf this keeps up, the F-00 will defeat\nboth [VAR 0102(0000)] and me...
F-00: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: ...\c\nA robot that has been reprogrammed is like\na totally different person, but...
F-00: ...Beep!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], [VAR 0100(0001)], [VAR 0100(0001)],\n[VAR 0100(0001)], [VAR 0100(0001)], [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What's happening?!
F-00: ...Beep ...Bloop ...Beep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey! F-00! What's wrong?
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleep!\c\n...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Tell me what's wrong!
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleep beeeep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Are you OK?!
F-00: Beep...\c\nBeep blop boop!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Is it broken?!
F-00: Beep bloop bop beeeeeep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's gone berserk!
F-00: Beep bloop bop beeeeeep!
Assistant: Come on, F-00! Obey my commands!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's no good...\nThe F-00 has lost control...\c\nIt won't listen to anyone in this state!\c\nIf the F-00 keeps this up, it's going\nto tear itself apart!
Assistant: What?! We can't let that happen!\nWhat should we do?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: We've got to stop its CPU,\nwhich functions as its heart...\c\nWe need to find a way to stop the F-00's\nCPU without destroying it.
Assistant: Stop the CPU without destroying\nthe F-00, huh?\c\nHmmm...\c\nI've got it!\c\nI know of a way!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What is it?
Assistant: We've got to freeze it!\c\nIf we can freeze the F-00's CPU,\nit should stop!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I see...\nNot a bad idea...
Assistant: [VAR 0100(0001)]... That's the first\ntime you've ever given me a compliment.
[VAR 0100(0001)]: We've done it!\nWe've stopped the F-00!
F-00: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00! Are you OK?!
F-00: ...\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: What?\c\nThe F-00 just said my name, didn't it?\nHow could that be possible?
F-00: [VAR 0100(0001)]...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: That's right! It's me, F-00!\nIt's [VAR 0100(0001)]!
F-00: [VAR 0100(0001)]...
Assistant: How in the world...\c\nHow could something like this occur?!\nThis is completely unscientific!\c\nI can't take this anymore!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00...
The F-00's memory banks were erased,\nyet it still called my name...\c\nIt was a true wonder...\c\nHowever, such a happy moment would\nprove to be fleeting.\c\nThe time for the F-00 and I to separate\nforever would soon arrive...
Assistant: Listen up, [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nIt's all your fault!\c\nWe're going to sell off this F-00 to the\nhighest bidder and use the money to fund\r\nour lab!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait...\nThe F-00... The F-00 is mine!
Assistant: Farewell, [VAR 0100(0001)]!
My assistant had betrayed me.\nMy F-00 was stolen, and I had to leave\r\nthe lab alone...\c\nAfter that, I quit robotics research and\nnever attempted to create another one.
F-00: ...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00...\c\nArgh! It's all your fault, you\nworthless assistant!
Assistant: What are you on about?\c\nYou're the one who betrayed us all in the\nfirst place and stopped working to play\r\nwith your robot! It's all your fault!
F-00: Bleep... Bleep...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00...
Assistant: Pff!\nYour robot's all busted up!\c\nIgnore that worthless hunk of junk and\nlisten to me!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Wait a moment...\nThis smell...it's coming from the F-00!
F-00: Bleep... Beep boop...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: I thought I smelled\nsomething burning...\c\nCould energy be leaking from its battery?
Assistant: Who cares?!\nIt's not like it's going to move again!\c\nGah! Worthless piece of junk!\nI'll shut it up once and for all!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: No! Stop!
Assistant: Shut up and stand back!\nI've got fists of fire, you know?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Stop!
After sustaining great damage, the F-00's\nbattery began to leak energy,\r\nplacing it in a very delicate state.\c\nEven the shock from my weak assistant's\npunch proved to be too great...\c\nThe F-00 exploded, blowing us away\nand destroying most of the lab\r\nin the process...\c\nMy assistant somehow made it out and\nwas taken to the hospital.\c\nI, however, remained here, forever\nclinging to the F-00's memory.
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: This is it...\nThe F-00 just won't stop...\c\nIt's going to overheat, and its engine\nwill explode!
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00...\nI'm so sorry... You must be in pain...\r\nI'll stay with you until the end...
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleeeeeeep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00! What do you think\nyou're doing?!
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleeeeeeep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Put me down, F-00!\nI told you. I'm going to stay here with you!
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleeeeeeep!\nGrrrrrr... Bzzzzzz...
[VAR 0100(0001)]: Hey! Stop it, F-00!\nPut me down!
Assistant: Ha ha ha...\nHow did things turn out like this?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: F-00!
The F-00 picked me up and threw me\nout of the lab.\c\nJust moments later...\c\nThe F-00's body had reached its limit.\nIt exploded, destroying most of the lab\r\nin the process...\c\nI barely escaped with my life...\c\nTo this day, I wonder if F-00 went berserk\nand didn't know what it was doing or if it\r\nreally intended to save me...
F-00: Beep bloop bop bleep!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: It's no good...\c\nThe energy-absorption system\nis malfunctioning!
F-00: Bleep! Bloop!
Assistant: Argh...why?
[VAR 0100(0001)]: You...\c\nJust what kind of new program did you\nput into the F-00?!
Assistant: ...\c\nTo be honest, your code was completely\nincomprehensible to me...\c\nEspecially that one formula that started\nwith a K. Total nonsense!\c\nThere's no way anyone could make sense\nof such needlessly complex code...\c\nSo, I went in and deleted the complicated\nparts of your code and changed it into\r\nsomething anyone can understand!\c\nI modified your formulas to handle only\nsimple operations... That's all!
[VAR 0100(0001)]: So that's what you did!\c\nThat formula that started with a K was\nthe most important one! It was the formula\r\nthat gave the F-00 a humanlike heart!\c\nIf you went in and messed it all up, then\nthat explains why the usually calm F-00 is\r\nnow going berserk...
Assistant: You can't be serious...\nThat means it's all my fault!

[VAR 0102(0000)]: Is there someone...\nSomeone possessed by a ghost?\r\nDo you want to help this person?

Addendum to\n“Ghost Eraser Case Files: File No. 001":\c\nThings look...tidy at the village graveyard.\nBut I have encountered information on a\r\nseparate case...of great concern.\r\nI continue to investigate.\c\n--Code name: [VAR 0102(0000)]
[VAR 0102(0000)]: Oh no!\nI think I've been possessed by something!\c\nEeegh!\nI can't move!

Addendum to\n“Ghost Eraser Case Files: File No. 001":\c\nAfter the case report was filed, we lost\ncontact with code name [VAR 0102(0000)].\c\nShe's still missing...

Kadath: YOUR BODY IS MOST SUITABLE.\c\nI SHALL TAKE OVER YOUR BODY...\nI SHALL KEEP YOUR SPIRIT AS WELL.\c\n...
[VAR 0102(0000)]: Eeeeegh!\n...
[VAR 0102(0000)]: UGHAGHA... THE DISTURBANCE IN\nTHE VILLAGE IS NOT REAL. I MUST REPORT...\c\nTHE VILLAGE IS...COMFORTABLE...AND SAFE...\nTHE SCENERY IS GREAT AND THE AIR IS FRESH.\c\nWE DO NOT NEED ANY NUISANCE PEOPLE\nCOMING TO INVESTIGATE THE VILLAGE...
Addendum to\n“Ghost Eraser Case Files: File No. 001":\c\nThe so-called ghostly disturbance was\nall nonsense. Lately, there have been a\r\nnumber of false reports. Please be aware.\c\n...Confirming the village is safe and\ncomfortable. The scenery is also great...
[VAR 0102(0000)]: ...
Kadath: ...\nFTHAGGHH... WHAT TROUBLES YOU?\r\nYOUR FACE IS ALL SQUINCHED UP...
[VAR 0102(0000)]: You!\nIt's so obvious that you're lying!\r\nQuit making a fool of yourself.\c\nYou're not possessed at all, are you?
Kadath: ...\c\nOopsie... You figured it out?\nAiiieee! Sooo-rrrry!
[VAR 0102(0000)]: Oh, come on.\nIt was obvious from the beginning.
Kadath: Oh, really?\nI thought I totally had you tricked!
[VAR 0102(0000)]: Sigh...\c\nWhat made you cause so much trouble?
Kadath: Well...\nI have a serious reason for my actions.\c\nThe truth is my wife works for\nthe tourist office in the village.\c\nShe said we needed to get this place on the\nmap! It's a dull village--not attracting any\r\ntourists at all.\r\nShe even cried about it.
She nearly had a breakdown, but then she\nhad a wonderful idea! She said we could use\r\nghost stories to get tourists interested.\c\nShe got so excited about her idea that\nnobody was able to talk sense into her.\c\nMe... I couldn't say no to her.\c\nI'm so sorry!\nPlease forgive my foolishness!
[VAR 0102(0000)]: You--\nYou deliberately deceived a Ghost Eraser.\c\nDon't bother asking for forgiveness.\nYou and your wife will report to our\r\noffice immediately!\c\nI doubt you'll get away with\njust a warning.
Kadath: Waaaaah!\nBut--it was my wife's fault! Not meeee!
...\c\nAddendum to\n“Ghost Eraser Case Files: File No. 001":\c\nThe ghost story was faked.\nLately, there have been a number of\r\nfalse reports. Please be aware.\c\n--Code name: [VAR 0102(0000)]

[VAR 0102(0000)]: Sigh...\c\nWhat made you cause so much trouble?
Kadath: Well...\nI have a serious reason for my actions.\c\nThe truth is my wife works for\nthe tourist office in the village.\c\nShe said we needed to get this place on the\nmap! It's a dull village--not attracting any\r\ntourists at all.\r\nShe even cried about it.
She nearly had a breakdown, but then she\nhad a wonderful idea! She said we could use\r\nghost stories to get tourists interested.\c\nShe got so excited about her idea that\nnobody was able to talk sense into her.\c\nMe... I couldn't say no to her.\c\nI'm so sorry!\nPlease forgive my foolishness!

The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Oops!\nThat didn't do it, did it?
Brycen-Man: You...are getting quite rusty,\naren't you?\c\nDon't tell me that\nyou've been loafing around\r\nwhile I was away!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Er...
Brycen-Man: Pathetic!\nI can't call you a rival at all!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Don't say that...
Brycen-Man: Arrgh...\c\nYou being weak lowers my\nreputation, too!\c\nYou give me no choice...\c\nI shall give you the honor\nof being trained by me!\c\nCome, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!\nI'll take you to my hideout!\c\nI will train you until you become\nthe hero of all heroes,\r\nthe worthy rival of myself, Brycen-Man!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Nooo!
Poor [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!\nHe couldn't defeat the Masked Man\r\nBrycen-Man's Pokémon party.\c\nHe was led by Brycen-Man to his hideout,\nwhere nightmarishly harsh training awaits...\c\nPush yourself, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!\c\nStrive, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: No!\nHow did I lose to you...?
Brycen-Man: Arrgh...\c\nLook at yourself,\n[VAR 0102(0000)] Kid...\c\nTo regard you as my rival\nwas a big mistake. How silly of me...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Arg...\nI did my best...
Brycen-Man: Sigh... Pathetic!\c\nI'm done with you!\c\nBattling you would just\nhurt my reputation!\c\nI'll just go find someone\nworthy to be my rival!\c\nFarewell, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Don't say that...\nWait up...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid let down Brycen-Man...\c\nA hero with no evil to fight\nis just an ordinary person\r\nwith a big imagination.\c\nThe story of the [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid\nhas, thus, come to an end...\c\nHow disappointing, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!\c\nFarewell, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!

Brycen-Man: Mwa!\nMwahaha!\r\nMwahahahahahaha!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: What's going on?
Brycen-Man: Impressive!\nThat was an utter defeat for me!\r\nYou've made it through!\c\nThat is what I'd expect from my son...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: What did you say?
Brycen-Man: ...!\c\nI must excuse myself now!\nFarewell, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Please wait!\c\nBrycen-Man!\nAre you...\r\nperhaps...my dad?
Brycen-Man: Wha...\nWhat nonsense!\c\nI'd remember it if I had\na son like you!\c\nI am a Masked Man!\nThe dark bachelor who goes\r\nwell with loneliness and melancholy!
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Is that so...\nI believe you...\c\nMy mom always told me...\nMy dad left us for his own dream\r\nwhen I was just a baby...
Brycen-Man: ...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: My dad couldn't have\nbecome a Masked Man to face me...\r\nThat would be too good to be true, right...?\c\nI'm sorry...\nBrycen-Man, please leave me now...
Brycen-Man: ...\c\nJust one thing...\nI have something to tell you,\r\n[VAR 0102(0000)] Kid...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: And that would be...
Brycen-Man: Little kid...\nThe power you are using for world peace...\r\nDon't you forget to use it\r\nfor your mom, too...
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: Brycen-Man...\nWhat are you saying?
Brycen-Man: I must leave now.\nFarewell, [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid!\c\nOr should I call you\n[VAR 0100(0001)]?
The [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid: How?\nHow do you know my real name?
Bring ring ring!
Waking up to the clock going off,\na little kid named [VAR 0100(0001)],\r\naka the [VAR 0102(0000)] Kid,\r\nrubbed his sleepy eyes...\c\nAll those words from Brycen-Man,\nand his true identity...\r\nIndeed, all was just a dream...\c\nOr perhaps that was little kid\n[VAR 0100(0001)]'s ideals.

Director: Hey!\nYou all right?!
Director: Hey! Get your head in the game!\nYou've gotta nail this line! Be aggressive.
Director: What are you doing?!\nDon't take your eyes off the other actor!
Director: OK! Just like that!\nYou're doing all right!
Director: Just relax!\nDon't be scared of the camera!
Director: Hey! More!\nPut more feeling into it!

Director: OK! Cut!\nAll right! This is gonna work!
Director: Cut! Cut!\nI've seen enough! We're done!
Director: Cut! Cut!\nOpinions will be divided on this one!
Director: You probably know already,\nbut read the script first...
Director: You've got the script, right?\nWe'll keep going with the shoot!
Director: Nice! Great!\nI feel good watching this!
Director: Wheehoo! That's so cool!

Director: Not a wasted move...\nThat line wasn't bad either...

I may be young, but I don't think\nI will lose, even against grown-ups.
Fweh! I am just a kid!\nYou are fighting for keeps!
Let's have an awesome\nPokémon battle!
Mmmph! Mmmmmph!\nYou see, it's fun to win!
You are pretty amazing!\nAnd you have totally exhausted me...
Very serious from the very beginning.\nAre you ever really prepared for this?
Seriously, winning a serious battle is\nseriously great!
Seriously, I lost. I am seriously depressed.\nBut you are seriously cool.
Go easy on me!\nThis is my first battle...
I can't believe I won my first battle!\nSay, did you go easy on me?
Ouch! That hurts!!\nBut... You are great...
You... You know,\nthese Pokémon are my friends.
I... I... I am sorry...\nI just wanted to introduce them to you.
Just being with these Pokémon\nmakes me happy...
...Heehee. I'm confident in calculation\nand analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned...\nI don't feel like losing.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis\nare no match for coincidence...
We're about to have a Pokémon battle.\nAt the very least, we say hello!
That could have gone better,\nbut thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration,\nbut thank you very much.
I am studying every single day...\nSo I am taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon is fun.\nI want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost...\nI may be better at studying.
I want to be a Pokémon research\nscientist when I grow up.
I'm wondering if Pokémon research\nprojects require test subjects...
I must do my best to learn\nmore about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong...\nI hope I will be all right...
Oops, you were not as strong\nas I expected... Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer!\nWhat you see is what you get.
I always get the best grades!\nI will try to be No. 1 for everything!
I will keep winning, winning, winning...\nI will be No. 1!
If I lose at such an early stage,\nI cannot be No. 1.
Wha--? You wanna fight with me?\nI suppoooose...
Ah, I shoulda known.\nDon't blame me.
Oh, wow. I am no match for you.\nYour Pokémon are great.
Mrrrrr... Mmrr grrr...\nGrrrrr... Mrrrrr...
Grrrrr... Mmrrrr...\n...Oh? Did I win?
Grrrrmmm... Mrrr...\nOh? Is that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe and\nthe mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell.\nI am worried about your future prospects.
I got carried away.\nI am worried about my future prospects.
Are you my opponent?\nYou look kind of hungry.
Have you eaten well?\nYou cannot do well on an empty stomach.
Are you really an ordinary person?\nWhat do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity,\nso I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you lost.\nNow, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won't give you\nmy lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon.\nI don't think I will lose.
You see! I am fine as long as\nI listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mommy! Where are you?\nPlease come and hug me!
A Trainer who looks gorgeous!\nI hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost against me?!\nI am a little disappointed.
Oh my, the battle was also gorgeous.\nI find myself drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you like?\nHey, hey. Let me see!
Your taste in Pokémon is excellent,\nbut you are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful,\nbut you are a first-class Trainer!
I am sorry--I lied.\nI am not a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to me\nwhen I pretended to be rich.
The truth is I am just the daughter\nof a Clerk ♂.
Ahaha...
Ahahaha...
Argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you!\nNice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna!\nTank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost!\nTank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler!\nI am already prepping for college.
You lost against a Preschooler...\nHow old are you again?
I am confident in studying, but\nI am just a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am a hero!\nI refuse to lose!
I AM a hero!\nI beat the bad person!
A hero never loses.\nA hero never dies.
I am very strong.\nI will never lose.
Daddy gave me these Pokémon!\nThey've got to be strong!
AAAAAAAAAH!
I thinks it are strange\nit complaining when they lose.
When I win, I are glad!\nHip, hip, hurray!
Boo!! I did lost... I are frustrated,\nbut I guess things my own fault.
Are you going to bully me?
You didn't bully me. I like you!
You bullied me, but I like you\n'cause you are strong!
Gmmmmm! Pokémon!\nGive it all you've got!
Mmmmph! Yahoo! Yahoo!\nThank you very much, Pokémon!
Boooooo! Come on, Pokémon.\nTry harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best!\nTrainer, do your best, too!
I am four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you are weak.
I am four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nI am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nDrifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nUntil I see you again...
I am not an ordinary Backpacker,\n'cause I am a newlywed.
'Cause my wife and I have no money,\nwe're hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
This trip is our honeymoon!\nBut I wandered off from my wife...
I am in the middle of my penniless travel.\nIt has its own charm.
Travel is best when you are poor\nand when you are young.
Aww... I am hungry...\nPlease spare something...
Argh! My backpack is heavy!\nWhy is it so heavy?
Why is this backpack so heavy?\nDid you put something in it?
Arrrgh! Why didn't you wait\nuntil I put down my bag?!
I wanted a short trip to heal my broken\nheart, but it's been a few months now...
A trip cannot heal my heartbreak...
I have no home to return to,\nso maybe I will live as a drifter...
Hm. I wonder who you are.\nI wonder if you'll have a battle with me.
You... You are weak.\nOr am I just strong?
You are strong.\nI wanna run away.
Sometimes I need a little time to rest.\nI will relax here!
That was a nice, refreshing time.\nI will work hard tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing.\nNow I am more stressed out.
I hope to work hard, save money,\nand have a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream.\nI just want to have a normal life.
I want to have security and happiness\nrather than chasing a big dream.
Hey! Welcome!\nWe have very fresh ingredients!
What do you think of my Pokémon?\nThey are fresh!
Thank you very much!\nHow were mine?
Didn't you come here for\na Pokémon battle?
Don't be scared, or\nyou will never win.
You are a strong Trainer.\nPlease forgive me.
Hiya, honey! Welcome!\nHave you decided what you'll have?
Order up! One humiliation\nin a Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory\nin a Pokémon battle, sunny-side up.
Meow, meow, it's a battle, meow.\n(That sounds stupid, doesn't it?)
Yeah! Meow! I won, meow!\n(I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I lost, meowww.\n(Seriously, I am sooo embarrassed.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than\nanybody else's. Love can do anything.
This victory proves\nmy true love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love should\nhelp me win, shouldn't it?
Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon\nthat I am proudest of?
What do you think about my\ndear Pokémon? Aren't they great?
Oh, my goodness!\nMy poor Pokémon...
For the honor of the branch office!\nHere I go!
I am the branch manager of\nthe Pokémon Fan Club. I won!
Pfft. Good-bye for now, child!\nI'll remember this!
I lost a lot of things because\nI love Pokémon too much...
I've devoted my life to Pokémon.\nI see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my devotion.\nWhat shall I do?!
Listen. I love love love Pokémon.
I will be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too!\nPlease let me pet them!
I am not good at battling, but\nthis is one of the duties of a Pokéfan.
I kept the honor of the Pokéfan.\nHahaha.
Cheers, all you Pokéfans!!\nMay the Pokéfan last forever!
I wanted to go hiking,\nbut I took the wrong train.
Well, this place is also interesting.
Ah, mountains... The mountains are\ncalling me.
I am no mere Hiker.\nCall me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me\nis properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous matters.\nThat is an alpinist.
I'm a Fisherman, so I have my rod here,\nbut this is cumbersome.
I won the battle, but\nI did not need this rod at all.
Ah... This rod is so cumbersome!\nI will quit fishing!
Oh, I kin tell yer rilly sumpthin'.
I knew it. You rilly ARE sumpthin'.
Like always, the big one done got away.
I won't be a Parasol Lady without\na parasol, so I must use it.
I think it is strange to use\na parasol indoors, though.
My parasol... My parasol is broken!\nI will be just a Lady.
My boyfriend left me on a rainy day.\nSo I will take it out on you.
The rain is piercing my broken heart\nand washing it clean.
They say rainy days never stay,\nbut will the rain in my heart ever stop?
I've been waiting for someone like you\nfor a long, long time.
I know you are the best.\nI will never let you go.
I like you.\nPlease be my friend.
I won't go easy on you just because\nyou're a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You cannot have a battle\nif you are afraid of losing.
Humph. I am still weak.\nI feel sorry for my Pokémon...
I am bad and stupid, but\nI am very serious about Pokémon.
I feel peaceful only when I am with Pokémon.
I hope you will find something\nyou can be serious about.
My shiny bald head is my secret.
The more I shave my head,\nthe stronger I can be.
You should have\na shiny bald head to be stronger.
You must be laughing at me 'cause\nI rode this far on my motorbike.
I've decided to live my life on my bike.
I am a coward who cannot even go out\nwithout my bike.
I am roaring around on my bike\nand chasing my own dream.
I feel I am getting one step closer\nto my dream.
You have to follow your own dream!
I am a Biker.\nBut I've never ridden a Bicycle.
I am a Biker.\nI don't have any friends yet.
I am a Biker.\nI've never won yet.
My Pokémon are on the rise! I raised\nthem with special yeast bread!
You'll get well again if you\neat my special bread.
You are strong.\nAre you eating my special bread?
One loaf, two loaves... No matter how\nmany times I count, one loaf is missing.
One loaf of bread is missing...\nThe master will be angry...
Oh, I'm so resentful...\nWhere is the missing loaf of bread?
Hey, you!\nDo you eat a good breakfast every day?
I never miss breakfast,\nso I am healthy and plump!
The first step for healthy living is\nto eat a good breakfast.
I am not loafing on the job!\nI am on patrol!
This place is dangerous!\nThis is too much fun!
I know about trouble like you!\nI am keeping my eye on you!
I am a Policeman!\nIn other words, I am justice!
Justice always prevails!\nThat is why I won!
I... I am a Policeman!\nWhy did justice fail?
I got scolded by my boss, and I lost\nmy motivation. I'll take it out on you!
Hehehe. You see!\nI am brilliant here.
Oh, man!\nAm I useless here, too?
I am young and fresh!\nI am nothing if not young!
What do you think? What do you think?\nI am very strong, aren't I?
I am fine even when I lose a battle.\nI am lively, lively!
I worked my way up to the top of the\ncomedians, and now I am a big shot.
You have a good sense of humor.\nDo you want to be my assistant?
Looking at you reminds me of friends\nfrom when I was working my way up.
I cannot do impressive stunts,\nso I will perform normally.
I am sorry. I shouldn't have won.\nI am just a Harlequin.
I am a Harlequin, but I'm sorry I cannot\nplay the fool after I lose.
I am smiling, though I am sad at heart.\nThis is the play of a lifetime!
You! That's not in the script!\nYou ruined the play!
Ha ha ha! It is the destiny of a Harlequin\nto smile when he loses.
Oh, no! I came to play\nwithout taking off my uniform.
Wow! Seriously? I won!\nI cannot go home when I win.
Ahhhhh! And I lost!\nThis is not my day.
You know, I am very popular,\nthanks to this costume.
Being popular is simple...\nI like it that way.
I feel good 'cause I am popular, but\nsometimes I feel empty.
Welcome back.\nYou must be tired from your work.
You must be tired.\nPlease do rest awhile.
That was superb!\nYou are very strong indeed.
I used to be so popular, but\nnow I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success, I took it\nfor granted, and I did not work hard.
As times change, values change.\nI realized it too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses.\nIf you lose, I hope you'll model for me.
I will do a sketch of you,\nfrustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait. I can create a masterpiece\nif you are my model.
Sensitivity is important for battles, too.\nYou! Feel it!
You need to feel it more! More!\nOtherwise you cannot win!
Ahh! I sense it!\nI sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!
Everybody grows bit by bit\nif somebody cherishes them.
I have cherished these Pokémon\nsince they were small.
You are also here\nbecause someone cherished you.
These days, when children fight,\ntheir parents fight on their behalf.
Children of childish parents.\nWhat kind of adults will they become?
Childish fights among adults are\nworse than fights among kids.
Iaaaa! You are cute!\nI want to take you home as my own!
Your face is cute even when you've lost!\nI want to comfort you, little one!
Ooooh! You are really cute!\nI want to raise you as my own!
I'll show you we can break you.\nWe've trained in the field!
How were my Pokémon?\nThey're very powerful, aren't they?
That's strange! I wonder why...\nI shouldn't be outmuscled.
Oh, you look very active!\nWhat say we battle?
OK! It's done!\nHow are my partners?
Goood, you are young!\nMy partners were totally crushed!
Pokémon battles after work\nare the one thing I truly enjoy.
Ahhhhhhhhh!\nThat's why I cannot quit training Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh. It hurts.\nIt hurts for a single man like me.
Pokémon are popular at work, too.\nOld guys can enjoy these battles!
Am I good for a guy who just\nbattles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both enjoy\nbattling with Pokémon.
Keep pedaling even when your legs\ncrumble. This is the secret of Cyclists.
A Pokémon trained by cycling\ncould never lose against a person like you.
My cycling has no limits.\nI will challenge you again someday.
My steel-wheeled friend brought me here.\nIsn't it the greatest ever?
This is my best friend forever!\nAlways reliable and true as steel!
I blundered, stumbled, and lost...\nWell, I still have my one and only.
Fun time is over.\nTime to wake up!
The end always comes as a shock.
You are greatly mistaken if you\nthink you can dream forever.
I'm done! It's just not good enough.\nA Bicycle is not enough of a challenge.
A Bicycle cannot satisfy me.\nI will join the Bikers!
Faster!! I want a speed that nobody\ncan beat!
I won't surrender to you.\nYou are nothing but a young fellow!
I won't lose against whippersnappers!\nI shall struggle on until the day I die!
Impressive! You are skillful for a\ngreen stripling, young fellow!
Like a powerful foaming cleanser,\nI will remove you!
Like a well-polished tile,\nthis is a sparkling victory!
Like a worn-out dust rag...
I am doing this job because\nI love love love trains.
You are happy if you choose something\nyou like as a job.
I love trains too much.\nIt's a sickness, really...
Your journey will end here.\nI am your terminal.
I praise you for coming up here.\nBut now, go home!
Ah... I didn't see it coming.\nI will rest over here...
I need to prove I'm worthy.\nI cannot lose against a child.
Am I childish? Adults do\nwhatever it takes to win.
My honor, my pride... I cannot show myself\nto my coworkers in such a miserable state.
Hey, I've learned a few things in my time.\nLet me demonstrate!
Not everyone likes me, but\nI am quite the Trainer, aren't I?
Your technique shows wisdom...\nAre you also an old man?
They say a company with lively workers\nis a good company!
I work hard all the time!\nI can battle 24/7!
Oh, look at the time!\nI have to get back to work!
My boss is seriously annoying!\nI believe I'll take it out on you!
Thank you for having a battle with me.\nI feel much better.
You should choose your company carefully,\nbecause you cannot choose your boss.
Are you my next patient?\nGet over here!
Good, good. I am glad\nthat you and your Pokémon are obedient.
Wait! You, wait!\nThe surgery has not started yet!
When there is a patient, I will be there.\nThat is my job.
Please put yourself at ease!\nYour Doctor is here.
If you are hurt, please call me.\nI'll be there for you.
Please go easy on me.\nI just finished my night shift.
After all that work, let's relax\nwith some Pokémon battles!
Yawn... I'm sleepy...\nI can't stay awake any longer...
How are you and your Pokémon?
I will inject you with my energy!
People can do so much\nas long as they have energy!
A Gentleman should have\na liking for battles.
A Gentleman should bask\nin the elegant glow of his victory.
A Gentleman should accept the result of\na battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of Pokéfans.
You can learn a lot from mature women,\nsuch as wisdom and good manners.
Woohoo! Were you knocked out by\nthe Socialite's charm?
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Oh-ho! Let's have a unique\nand elegant battle.
Ah-ha! I was not confident,\nbut this is a delightful surprise.
Eeeeee! I'll remember this!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon...\nPokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your Pokémon,\neven when you lose.
It is important to nurture and train\neach Pokémon's characteristics.
Do you discipline your Pokémon?\nPampering them too much is no good.
You need to discipline Pokémon you\nlove when they are misbehaving.
Too much praise can spoil\nboth Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you.\nThey will return the love you give them.
This proves my love has been received\nby my Pokémon.
It's about time for me to give someone\nmy affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for\ntraining good Pokémon?
The tip for training good Pokémon is\nto catch good Pokémon.
You don't seem to need any tips\nfor training good Pokémon.
Glad you made it! It won't be\nan easy job from here.
Haha! You see!?\nYou are not ready yet.
Earlier I got a little carried away,\nbut what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and dad are Ace Trainers.\nSo I am an Ace, too!
I want to be an Ace Trainer like\nmy mom and dad.
Waaaa! I should have superior genes and\nbe able to ride on my parents' coattails...
I don't mind your lack of focus, but you\nwill get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see! You did not focus\non the battle. That's why you lost.
That is quite enough. It's over.\nDon't stare at me!
Dad... Mom...\nI'll have a battle. Look...
Dad... Mom...\nDid you see me? I won... I won!
Dad... Mom...\nWhat shall I do?
I came here to goof off.\nI don't want to cram for the big test...
I cannot lose...\nI don't want to study anymore.
No! I don't want to go home!\nI don't want to study!
I just want to be successful\nand grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday and\nput you to shame.
I don't care who you are\nor where you come from.
How should we act?\nThat is all that matters, isn't it?
A label is not important, is it?\nAfter all, you are you, aren't you?
Pokémon battles and study sessions\nare much the same. Let's be efficient!
You are too inefficient.\nYou need to be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such a slacker?\nI cannot believe it!
I have money to burn,\nso I don't want anything.
The only thing I enjoy\nis a Pokémon battle...
Just because I am rich\ndoes not mean I am especially happy.
Yes! I am a Rich Boy!
Well, good-bye!\nYou have been beaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci!\nYou defeated a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun,\nbut I'll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance.\nPlease pay it no mind.
It's good when you battle for fun.\nIf it's too serious, you won't enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a\nbattle. I am rich. I always have fun!
I do not have to work,\nbecause I am loaded with cash.
All play makes me a dull girl.\nDo you think I don't know that?
I'm proud of these Pokémon!\nGo on, rush the enemy position!
My Pokémon are mighty!\nI will carve my name in history!
I won't cry... I won't.\nSomeday, I will be able to win.
I came here for my big brother\nwho always hides in his room.
My big brother the hermit,\nI won for you! Come out and play!
I wish my brother would\ncome out of his room and play with me...
Hello me old china,\ntime for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and write,\nTrainer, many clinks!
Even if you dipper, you'll be fine.\nBest of friar, Trainer!
All Dad and Mom do is mumble\nat their computers! That's no fun!
I don't like Dad, or Mom, or computers!\nAll I need are my Pokémon!
Instead of mumbling to computers,\nI wish they would talk to me...
A globe-trotting young adventurer.\nThat's me!
Seeing Pokémon all over the world is\nthe purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me.\nFarewell! See you again!
Let's take it easy\nwith Pokémon and with life.
It's OK to bust your tail. But you need\nto have some breathing room.
No problem. No problem.\nI will have another chance.
I've traveled 3,000 miles searching\nfor a husband! A journey to nowhere.
Please let me know if there is a rich,\nwealthy, or affluent gentleman!
My goal is a wedding band...\nBut is that really a utopia?
A game is life,\nbut life is not a game.
I am always serious. You cannot win\nif you think this is just a game.
I'll give up games forever and set out\non a journey... Just kidding!
I'll always work part-time, because\nit lets me focus on what I really love.
You have only one life to live.\nAre you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever\nwithout being tied down.
I took this job 'cause I wanted to see\nsmiles on people's faces.
Don't look at me like that.\nSmile! Smile!
It's very frustrating,\nbut I am glad I saw you smile.
Let's start a battle already!\nWe are wasting time.
What? Is it already over?\nWe still have lots of time.
We ran out of time.\nWe cannot go into overtime!
I am battling here to promote\nthe café where I work.
You are not that strong,\nso you are not really right for my café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer!\nSee you at my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokéfans.\nYour life will be happy!
If you join the Pokéfans,\nyou'll be strong like me!
If you join the Pokéfans,\nyour life will be saved!
I am not a regular Pokéfan.\nI am a major mega-Pokéfan!
I love Pokémon.\nI love love Pokémon!
You'll remember this!\nI am a big Pokéfan!
I think I am a Pokéfan,\ntherefore I am a Pokéfan.
The Pokéfan is power.
You should remember this.\nI am a Pokéfan.
There are young and beautiful people,\nbut youth is different from beauty.
If I had known that when I was young,\nI would not have a hard time now...
Youth is just youth.\nI wish I had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain standing\nin my way, aren't ya?
Yahoooooo!! Yahoooooooo!\nHear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared\nin a crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\nI am a Hiker. I have a cult following!
Oh no? It's over already?\nHiker is bored!!
This is important, so remember this!\nDon't judge a book by its cover!
Despite my appearance, I am the head\nof a certain outfit. Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone that I am playing here.
The boss does not have freedom.\nI feel like a captured Pokémon.
The truth is, I want to have a quiet life\nfishing all day, every day.
Ah... I don't want to do anything but fish.\nI am tired of winning and losing.
At my time of life, it doesn't matter\nif I win or lose.
Hello? Me? What, now?\nI am about to have a battle.
Hello? Can you hear me?\nI just won the battle.
Ah... Hello? Can you hear me?\nArgh! I lost...
He told me that I was like a squall,\nbut what is a squall?
W-wah! Wahhh!\nI am so happy that I am crying.
W-w-wahhhhh! Wahhhhh!\nWahhhhh! Wahhhhh!
No need to chat with someone\nI'm about to battle.
Life is over if you lose.\nThat's why I hold out.
Don't look at miserable me!\nGo away!
You have your way.\nI have my way.
I will go my way 'cause\nI don't have any other way.
Your way must be rocky.\nGood luck. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don't mess with me,\nor I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble for me,\nbut what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move?\nGah, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both Veterans,\nbut I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad\nif they see that I've become a Roughneck.
I cannot be like my mom and dad.\nSo I will live as a Roughneck.
My partner has turned to dust,\nbut his Pokémon is my Pokémon now.
Are you watching me, my long-lost partner?\nThat Pokémon of yours, we get along...
He was trash, but now he is eternal,\nlike the stars in the sky... Ah, my partner!
I am no good at speaking...\nSo my bike speaks...
Zooooom! Zoom whoosh!\nZooooom! Zoom zam!
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!\nVrooooooooom! Vroom!
All right! Are you ready?\nDon't mess with a Biker!
I'm a Biker, so I'm more obsessed\nwith speed than anyone else!!
The truth is we are good guys.\nWe cannot do bad things at all!
Like uncooked dough,\nmy Pokémon are sticky!
Now you're stuck, aren't ya?
Well, your Pokémon are quite springy, too.
As I bake bread, I will bake your\nPokémon, too.
Oh my... Your Pokémon are like\nburned bread.
Ah, how frustrating and disappointing!\nYou burned me with that last move...
Just as I knead the dough,\nI'll knead you into shape.
Wanna be kneaded a little more?\nOr shall I sandwich you with bread?
Ooooo! I'll remember this!\nI'll turn you into a sandwich someday!
Laughing makes people feel better.\nThere seems to be scientific proof!
Haaa ha ha! Ha?\nWhat's wrong? Let's laugh!
Laugh at miserable me--I lost against\namazing you. Laugh and you'll feel better.
You think you can win against me?\nIt might not go as smoothly as you think.
Don't underestimate me just because\nI am a Harlequin.
No. This can't be happening.\nYou're not an ordinary person.
Observe my beautiful Pokémon magic!\nPlease watch closely!
I know a few gimmicks and tricks,\n'cause this is magic.
Tricks and magic are my bread and butter.\nAny Harlequin knows their worth!
Tedious talk is unnecessary...\nI will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I'm broken...
I have low self-esteem,\nso I like someone to give me orders.
You are not my boss, so\nit doesn't matter even if you are weak.
Can I call you my boss?
This outfit is not a uniform--\nit's what I like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime.\nDoesn't it look good on me?
I want to live in a world of games,\nanime, and comics forever.
I'm not cut out for a regular job,\nso I live on art.
I envy Pokémon, 'cause they are\ncarefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah, if I can do a regular job,\nI will quit doing this stinking art.
Every time a Pokémon uses a move,\nmy heart will tremble!
Nothing stirs the soul\nmore than Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful!\nI could almost faint!
I will make you cry,\n'cause you just don't know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and confusion\ncan also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate the value\nof defeat and sorrow.
Our job is hard,\n'cause it's such physical work.
My work gave me these great muscles.
Don't underestimate the power of kids.\nLike I did with you!
Raising Pokémon and raising kids.\nBoth are very hard.
When my Pokémon do well like this,\nI forget my everyday troubles.
Even I raise them with tender care,\nbecause I am their Trainer...
Hey, you!\nI promise I will take it easy on you!
Heheh... I will take it easy on you. Heh.
Sometimes even grown-ups want\nsomeone to take care of them.
The job site is quite dangerous, but\nI'll have to keep working with Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well,\nand it's ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I cannot make money tomorrow\n'cause I am injured.
Welcome!
Only the winner!\nOnly the winner can celebrate.
Enough... That's enough...
I do menial work every single day.\nAm I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down\nthe smooth running of this machine!
I may be happier than a person who\ncannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I'm the Worker\nthat everybody is talking about.
If you don't know me, you're bogus!\nGood-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker\neverybody's talking about.
Well, let me introduce myself.\nThese are my little darlings.
How was it? My little darlings are tough and\ncute, aren't they?
Phew! Your little darlings are awesome, too!
Whir, whir, whir, whoooosh!
Ring-ring! Ding-ding!
Bam!
This is the very latest model,\na limited-edition, carbon-fiber Bicycle.
When you have good tools,\nyou feel better about yourself.
Don't! Please don't touch my Bicycle.\nYou'll cover it with your filthy fingerprints.
Speed is the key in a battle!\nDash! Dash! Dash!
If I compare how I'm feeling right now to a\nrace, it is just like crossing the finish line!
I cannot take your nonsense anymore!\nI am moving back to my mother's place.
Hey, you! Take out all the Pokémon\nyou have here!
Huh? That's all you have?\nAren't you hiding a few more Pokémon?
I see. There seems to be nothing\nsuspicious about you or your Pokémon.
I'll protect my peace by myself.
My peace remains protected.
Please don't disturb my peace and quiet.
I was born to work.\nThat is my destiny.
I will work, work, and work some more.\nI am happy only when I am working.
As a matter of fact, having battles\nis my job, too.
I'm-a lowest rank now, but\nI'm-a gonna be at the top someday!
I'm-a gonna be the brightest star\nin the business! Top of the world, ma!
You work it like a shining star!\nI'm not gonna lose, I'm not gonna lose!
I have an ambition!\nI will take over the company!
All this serves my ambition!\nIt brings my sweet victory one step closer!
I was obsessed with the golden prize,\nwith my glittering ambition!
I am treated as an idol at the office.\nEverybody pampers me.
Everybody works for me,\nso I have nothing to do.
The truth is I don't like brushing my teeth\nor taking a bath, but don't tell anyone.
You look dusty.\nI'll give you a good scrub!
OK, you look a little bit cleaner now!
Hey! Don't run away!\nYou need to be scrubbed more!
These fruits of stubbornness were raised\nstubbornly by a stubborn old man.
This stubborn old man raised them.\nMy persistence is different from yours!
There's a fine line between persistence\nand stubbornness. I may retire soon.
I'm good at driving, but\nI'm not good at dealing with Pokémon.
Oh, it went unexpectedly well.\nBy any chance, am I a technician?
My train does what I need. It's harder to\nconvince living Pokémon to do things my way.
I've never left this place even once\nsince I was born.
I wonder if I will live here\nfor the rest of my life...
I wonder how long I will stay here...\nWhat is there outside this world?
I say this as a Doctor.\nFirst of all, you must save money.
Money cannot buy health.\nBut you cannot stay healthy if you're poor.
Because without money, you can neither\neat healthy food nor go to see a Doctor.
As you can see, I am a Doctor,\nbut I've never examined a patient.
I've studied to become a Doctor,\nbut I faint when I see blood.
I am a Sunday Doctor,\nrather like a Sunday driver.
Can you understand\nwhat medical personnel need?
What a Doctor needs is love--\nthe rush of unconditional love.
Medical service is love.\nCan you be a Doctor?
I took this job because I wanted\nto be needed by someone.
My job is hard,\nbut I am happy to help people.
When a patient leaves the hospital,\nI feel happy but a bit sad.
Grown-ups have a lot of hobbies.\nActually, I am a uniform collector.
I am not a Nurse.\nI wear this uniform just for fun.
You realized that I am a fake Nurse!\nYes, I am just a uniform collector.
Even if you are injured, I will treat you.\nSo let's fight hard.
Sorry! I went too far. Do you require\nimmediate hospitalization?
You went too far! I will bill you\nthe cost of my medical expenses!
I raised these very special Pokémon\nusing a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak\ndepending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn't supposed to be like this.\nDid I blend the essence wrong?
Shall I share an exclusive tip\nfor training great Pokémon?
You'll be perfect if you buy my book\nof Pokémon-training tips.
You'll be fine if you buy my DVD\nof Pokémon-training tips.
Pokémon are my family!\nSee the solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters!\nOur family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My family!\nWhat have you done?!
What you like and what you're good at\nare different, or at least separate.
I am good at battling,\nbut I don't enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job,\nyou have a sense of fulfillment, don't you?
In summary, you cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win, because\nyou are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good.\nYou are really pretty good.
Don't underestimate me because I'm old.\nI'll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I'm old but still going strong!\nI can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat a helpless\nold man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon. But I have\nno one to carry on the family tradition...
If I had a child like you,\nmy golden years would be carefree...
I wish my son were\nas mature as you are.
I feel sad when I see a young and\nbright child like you.
The first flush of youth...\nYou are too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin...\nI won't get them back.
Hey! It's me. It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in the world!
How's that? Pwned!!
You! Who are you?!\nDo you know who I am?
I'm at the top of the heap! I'm a man\nwho always wants to come in first.
Remember this! My favorite words\nare "top of the heap."
You. Well done!\nSee you! I'll remember this!
I won't back down, lose, or fail!\nNo defeat for a Clerk ♂.
Uh-huh!
Uuugh... Well done...\nYou made me fall to my knees...
I can do it! I can do anything!\nI will do it! I will do it!
Yes! I did it! I can do it!\nI can do it! I can doooooooo it!
But I listened to my Teacher's advice.\nI can't lose! I can't!
My research will lead this world\nto peace and happiness.
I am a genius. I will control\nthe future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed\nto lose against someone like you...
Only research is left in my life.\nI abandoned my family and friends.
It's not bad to devote my whole life\nto research, is it?
Dedicating yourself to something\ncan cause loneliness.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... Please lend me\na hand for my experiment.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... I did it.\nThe experiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good...\nThis experiment was a failure...
You must face off against\nmy extremely powered-up Pokémon!
Well, this is a natural outcome.\nThe power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have even more awesome\nstrength than the power of science.
If you lose, I'll have you help me\nin my latest experiment!
Ho hi ho. You lost! You will help science\nas my new assistant.
Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up\nas my new assistant.
Why do people compete and fight?\nThis is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt your\nopponent's feelings.
If you lose, you may resent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Foooooooooooo!
Eeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense.\nPretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a sport\nare the height of vileness...
Defeat is worth nothing.\nLosers don't need words...
He-he-he. If you lose,\nI will turn you into a Pokémon.
He-he-he. Well, from today on,\nyou are already a Pokémon.
Next time I see you, I will turn you\ninto a Pokémon with my power.
Argh... I have a headache...\nI have such a headache...
I don't need psychic powers.\nPlease stop this headache...
If I don't keep using my power for battles,\nmy headache won't go away...
I claim that I am a Psychic,\nbut I cannot use psychic powers.
I am camouflaging it\nwith my Psychic-ish costume.
I go to magic classes\nto look like a Psychic.
...Grrr... Yeeek!!\nAn evil spirit! Go away!!
OK! The evil spirit\nthat possessed you has disappeared.
Evil spirit!\nLeave the Trainer at once!
I praise your courage for challenging me!\nI am the one with the strongest kick.
Haha... I probably did not have to use\nmy strongest kick on you.
Oh... The Pokémon did the fighting.\nMy strong kick didn't help a bit.
'Suuup! I'll give it all I've got!\nLet's do our best!!
'Sup! That's enough!\nPlease value your life!
'Suuuuup! Good work. I tried everything\nI could, but I'm disappointed.
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don't have to impress me.\nYou can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It's sad to say good-bye,\nbut we're running out of time.
Are you ready?\nI'll take the gloves off.
Well, well... You're not even in my league.\nThis is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe I lost!\nWho are you?!
I would like to do the fighting\ninstead of my Pokémon if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a\nchallenge. I want to make this personal.
Ah, I tingle with excitement.\nI would like to fight...
Halt at once! You over there!\nLet us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield!\nPlease spare me. Please!
When I am surrounded by nature,\nmost other things cease to matter.
I won. But victory is nothing\ncompared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn't matter to the vastness\nof nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I am a city boy.\nSo I yearn for country life.
Do you have a hometown?\nIf so, you should go back and visit there.
I don't have a hometown to go back to,\n'cause I was born and raised in the city.
It's my mission to protect nature\nand all Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural order,\nI will put them all in jail!
Protect Mother Nature!\nOtherwise, I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect\nMother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich natural\nenvironment and for the Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by\nsaving money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn.\nLet me give you a crash course!
You didn't win alone. You couldn't have won\nwithout your Pokémon.
You seem to be quite confident.\nI'll sink you straightaway.
I am devoting my body and soul\nto Pokémon battles!
AAAAAAAAH! I am sooooo scared!\nI will never do it again... Sorrrry!
I'm working very hard, but\nthat doesn't mean I am strong.
You're a strong Trainer,\nso I think I was just lucky this time.
Even I can lose?!\nBut I'm a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but\nI became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have\nclear goals. That's the way it goes.
I'm still not popular even though\nI've been recognized as an Ace.
The lead character of this story...\nI'll tell you who it is!
The lead character of the story is me!\nYou are just an extra!
Of course, you are the lead character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon battle\nagainst the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time\non such a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho-ho-ho! That is to our liking!\nWe find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and\nfight forever. That's the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won't be\nsatisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn't it?
Your fighting style suits you very well.\nYou can be an Ace Trainer.
I can see despair in your eyes.\nBring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected.\nYou should start training all over again.
Did I underestimate you as just a little kid?\nOr was this your true ability?
Hey, you, young Trainer.\nI am utterly stylish, aren't I?
I am so stylish,\nI hypnotize myself! Step back!
I'm a wreck. I'm adrift. It just kills me.\nIt is hard to be too stylish.
I won't lose against a kid like you\nwho doesn't know anything about battles.
After all, you are an amateur. No sweat.\n(Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner?\nHa ha ha... I had no idea!
Argh. Cough, cough. I don't feel well.\nPlease show a little kindness.
I lied when I said I didn't feel well!\nVeterans do anything to win!
You're very sharp!\nYou did not fall for my illness act.
I will give you a taste\nof a Veteran's well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran's Pokémon?\nDefeat is bitter, isn't it?
You have served me a spicy defeat.\nAnd yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute!\nCome, I promise to be nice in this battle.
You are so cute, really...\nI want to see you again. I'll be waiting.
Your battle is a little too cute.\nLet's play again sometime.
Oh, you are still a child.\nWho said you could come here?
You're not bad, but you're immature.\nCome back when you've learned something.
I thought you were a child.\nHee hee... You are tough...
Don't call me a Veteran!\nA woman's mind is always blooming.
I'm not finished with love or Pokémon.\nI'll stay fit and ready all my life.
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and\nmy back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker.\nI have a lot of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack,\naren't I? Aren't I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag!\nWait, my Bag has a hole...
I am not traveling for freedom.
You're carrying bulky luggage,\nbut do you really need it?
My Bag is as wide as the sky.\nIn other words, my Bag is empty.
I haven't eaten anything for days.\nSpots are floating before my eyes...
Those aren't spots floating before my eyes.\nThose are glorious glimmers of victory!
Ah, I'm sinking fast. All I can think about\nis where my next meal is coming from...
Neither my husband nor I have money,\nso we are hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
Newly married, and such a big trip...\nI'm worried about our future.
On top of that, I have lost track of him...\nWhere can he be wandering?
Hey! Hey!\nPlease check out my cute Pokémon!
How about that?\nI'm proud of these Pokémon.
Oh no, don't bother them like that!\nPlease leave my Pokémon alone.
Being a Waiter is my disguise,\nand it helps me live quietly.
On my days off, the real me is ready.\nI'm an Ace Trainer!
I'm struggling to make a living,\nso I've been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest.\nI don't think I will lose.
Do you think you can win against me\nwith such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It's hard.\nIt sure is frustrating to lose.
Don't you think a restaurant\nfor Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will like\na full-course meal for Pokémon.
It's a restaurant for Pokémon,\nnot a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Haroooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the mountain range of your life!\nCross me if you can!
Haha! I am the summit, and the road\nto reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed the mountain!\nThis is my summit!
If I lose, I'll spill the secret of fishing.\nIf I win, I'll tell you the essence.
The essence of fishing is to pull\nand reel in the fish--nothing else.
The secret of fishing is to wait without\nthinking, as if you were dozing off.
I always aim for a big fish!\nStay out of this if you are a small fish!
Reeling you in was hard work.\nYou put up a good fight!
Oh! What a great hit!\nBoth my arms and heart are electrified!
You look kind of mature.\nI like people like you.
Still, you look mature for your age.\nAre you already an adult, or are you a kid?
A man with the heart of a boy\nis just a wheedling child.
How much did this parasol cost?\nWhy, it is a cheap disposable.
I am a Parasol Lady, but I cannot\nspend money for a parasol.
A parasol is just a tool. It's fine\nas long as it protects me from the rain.
I can really cut loose in Pokémon\nbattles without being scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That's why\nPokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don't ya?\nYou are my pal.
My computer friends said I wouldn't be\ntaken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared...\nMaybe I am not cut out for this.
Eeek... I should have played\nwith my computer in my room.
My ride and I\nare always together.
My ride helps me show off who I am.
My motorbike makes me feel better\nwhen I lose.
I don't have money to buy gas,\nso I have to push it with my feet.
I'm one of the Bikers,\nso my bike is crucial.
Ah... Dad, Mom.\nIt's hard to be a Biker...
Aah, I am so hungry that I am\ncompletely wiped out. What shall I do?
I'm working at a bakery, 'cause I want to\neat bread anytime I want.
Aah! I crashed from my sugar high!\nSomeone give me a pastry!
OK, I will do it!\nI am excited about this!
Bam!
I'll remember this!
I'll confuse you with my smooth moves.\nA-one, a-two, cha cha cha!
You could not focus on the battle,\n'cause you were watching my smooth steps!
And one, and two, and twirl, and...\nAh, that didn't work at all!
Sorry to keep you waiting.\nYour idol, Harlequin, Harlequin.
Thank you very much.\nIt was Harlequin, Harlequin.
It was Harlequin, Harlequin.\nThank you for your support.
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I'll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange.\nI feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of blah.\nI'm all achy...
I really feel blah.\nWell, I will go home now.
A child like you cannot understand\nthe beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a servant of beauty.\nUgly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I've been looking for...\nis you?
I paint pictures and live with Pokémon.\nI am enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will be a good\nmemory as you grow older.
Experience hardships when you are young,\n'cause old bodies cannot take them.
My schoolkids are sleeping.\nI'm shooting for the top during nap time!
Oh, no!\nLook at the time!
After nap time comes snack time.\nI have to go back to preschool soon.
Life is full of so many farewells,\nso I will enjoy the present.
I cannot see you again,\nso I will do my best.
This is a woman's life.\nCan a baby like you understand it?
If you work diligently,\nyou will get results.
You, keep trying.\nMaster the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently,\nthings don't always go well.
I've arrived from a distant island.\nMay I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I'd be\ngrateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon\nthat my wife is as mad as a hornet.
Pokémon battles are so much fun.\nNo way I can quit.
I don't want to go home, 'cause my wife\nis as scary as a legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary days.\nI gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me\nfrom boring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special person like you,\nI just melt.
I used to be like you.\nI was full of hopes and dreams.
Dreams are important.\nBut if all you have is your dreamworld...
Just having hopes and dreams is not enough.\nWhat is important is... Never mind.
I want to have an exhilarating battle.\nGot it?
Thank you!\nA battle is extremely exhilarating!
OK, OK, I got it...\nLet's call it a day.
It's OK if I have training wheels.\nIt’s OK if my Bike doesn't accelerate.
It's OK if you go your own way.\nYou'll reach your goal someday.
It's OK if you lose.\nIt's OK, as long as you have a Bicycle.
You ain't never even gonna see\nmy Pokémon's moves.
You're slow, ain't ya?
You're right quick!\nWho are ya, anyways?
I just got married, and we'll be\nexpanding our family soon.
You know what I need.\nCan you spare a few dollars?
Oh, I should really get home,\nbut Pokémon battles are so much fun...
Take a good look\nat this Clerk ♂'s sheer strength!
Keep training with the best,\nand you'll surpass the rest!
I put on a smile when I'm crying inside.\nThat's a Clerk ♂'s sad smile.
I will show you the harsh side\nof Pokémon battles.
That's not good.\nI was too generous today.
Did you burn the image of my Pokémon\ninto your mind?
Who do you think I am?\nI am a mighty Policeman!
That's for disobeying me!\nI am a big guy!
You won a battle against a Policeman...\nI will arrest you someday.
It's embarrassing, but I wasn't\nwell behaved when I was young.
You lack energy despite your youth.\nShall I train you?
Good, good. Misbehave while you're still\nyoung and you can get away with it.
Squeak! Squeak, squeak, squeak...\nHm? What? Wanna fight?
You're so impatient.\nI'm still in the middle of my work.
Ohh dear... You tracked dirt\non the floor I just finished cleaning...
There are only two roads in life.\nThe one you like, and the one you hate.
I'll choose the road I like,\neven though it is not the quickest route.
Actually, the road you hate\nmay be the shortcut to your goal.
I am a train.\nI will just run on the tracks.
You are a station where I don't stop.\nI will just pass you by.
I think the train is great, because it runs\nthe same route over and over.
You're good at your job\nand very strong.
I expected too much from you.\nYou are lucky that this is not business.
A person who can juggle\nwork and play is pretty cool.
I've been with these Pokémon\nsince I was a child.
Pokémon are like family to me.
I don't think I want to have children.\nI'd rather focus on my Pokémon family.
Hi, I am a physician!\nHey! Let me give you a shot!
Come now, let me give you a shot!\nDon’t worry. It won't hurt!
You have strong arms!\nSo let me give you a shot now!
Cough! Cough, cough! How many\nmore people will I be able to save?
Cough! I wanted to save more people.\nCough, cough!
Few physicians live well...\nCough! I can't go on any longer...
Do you want a shot?\nOr an IV drip?
You want both a shot and an IV.\nYou are greedy!
Argh. It's sickening!\nYou're such a drip.
In this job,\nI've seen a lot of strange things.
I don't know why, but Ghost-type\nPokémon seem attracted to me.
Ahhh, I lost... By the way,\nwho is that standing behind you?
I have raised them too long.\nThey are beyond my control...
It's over...\nNobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down...\nYou saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon\nyou have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do?\nI expected more from you...
Wow! You are awesome!\nWhat great Pokémon you've trained!
Take a look at these Pokémon--I raised\n'em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon.\nThey're my friends and my treasures.
You are a strong one, sure enuff.\nBut I don't intend to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder.\nI can tame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are very loyal,\naren't they?
They are too attached to me.\nThey are not fit for battling.
Arghhhh! Who is gentle?!\nI will bring you down!
Arghh! Arghh!\nI am NOT a Gentleman!
Arghh! You! You'll regret this!\nI will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once...\nEyes! Aim for the eyes!
What my brother told me was right...\nThanks... Bro...
I lost against a kid. Bro...\nI should have listened to you...
I can't drop my luxurious lifestyle just\nbecause I'm older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child,\nbut money makes the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits\nI learned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer.\nI'll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, bloom, and blossom!\nA woman who flowers and triumphs!
I want to blossom and fall\nrather than dying on the vine.
Hey, it's me. It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in the world!
No! That's no good!\nYou cannot reach the top that way.
Good. You're daring!\nI'll let you come fly on my plane.
Hey! Yo! It's me.\nI am the best Pilot in the world.
Listen! A Trainer should be No. 1.\nThat's it!
You're quite a Trainer!\nBe my apprentice!
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Thank you for riding\nthe Battle Subway today.\r\nI am the Subway Boss Ingo.\c\nI will choose the next destination\nbased on your talent.\c\nDo you understand Pokémon well?\nCan you hold on to your principle?\r\nWill you go on to victory or defeat?\c\nAll aboard!
Ah. Your battle was not bad at all.\c\nHowever, we seem to have done slightly\nbetter than you.\c\nWe would really like to battle with you again!\c\nPlease ride the Battle Subway again!
Bravo!!\c\nYour talent has brought you\nto the destination called Victory!\c\nHowever, your journey has just started.\c\nWhen you choose your next destination,\ngo full speed ahead!
Welcome! I've been waiting for you!\c\nLet me introduce myself...\nI am the Subway Boss Ingo.\c\nWhat can I see after winning,\nwinning, and winning?\c\nWhere is my destination?\c\nI've kept thinking, and\nI've learned one thing.\c\nThat is, you cannot know what happens\nafter winning without winning.\c\nTherefore, I will exert every possible\neffort to battle with you.\c\nAll aboard!
I have won this time, but\nyour talent is very strong!\c\nYour tactics...reading...\nYou have great skills.\c\nThat's right! I would like to\nbattle you again and again!\c\nPlease ride the Battle Subway again soon!
Bravo!\nExcellent!!\c\nI am glad that I fought so hard\nagainst a wonderful Trainer like you.\c\nThat's right!\nYou grow stronger by matching yourself\r\nagainst a strong opponent.\c\nPlease do your best and run\ntoward the destination--\r\nan even higher state.
I am Emmet.\c\nI am a Subway Boss.\c\nI like Double Battles.\c\nI like combinations of\ntwo Pokémon.\c\nAnd I like winning\nmore than anything else.\c\nSo let's start a great battle\nin which every Pokémon uses\r\nvarious moves.
I am Emmet.\c\nI won against you.\c\nBut I think I just got lucky.\c\nIn a Double Battle, if you misread one thing,\nthe rest will be totally different.\c\nYou know.\nPlease win 20 battles in a row, and\r\nfight with me!
I am Emmet.\c\nI lost against you.\c\nBecause you are the strongest Trainer\nI've fought lately.\r\nYou're a verrrrry strong Trainer!\c\nYup! It was fun!\nRide the trains some more!
Hi, do you remember me?\nI am Emmet.\c\nI am a Subway Boss.\c\nI like Double Battles.\c\nI like combinations of\ntwo Pokémon.\c\nAnd I like winning\nmore than anything else.\c\nThis time, I am really serious.\nReally serious.\c\nBecause if a battle is not serious,\nit is not fun.
I am Emmet.\c\nI won against you.\nBut this is not the end.\c\nI am sure you will show up\nhere again.\c\nI will wait for it and\nwin against you again.\c\nBecause I am a\nSubway Boss. I am Emmet.
I am Emmet.\c\nI am a Subway Boss,\nbut I lost against you again.\c\nBut I feel good.\nBecause it was very fun!\c\nYou want to win, and\nI don't want to lose.\r\nThat's real.\c\nWhen we clash in battles,\nI feel very excited!
I am a Subway Boss, Ingo.\c\nThe fellow over to the side is\nalso a Subway Boss, Emmet.\c\nWill a Multi Battle help us cover\neach other's weakness?\c\nOr will you show your\noverwhelming power?\c\nI look forward to seeing\nhow well you fight.\c\nHowever, it is difficult to win\nunless you and your partner\r\nare in total sync.
We make a good two-car train,\nIngo and Emmet.\c\nThis time, we worked together toward\na victory.\c\nHowever, your abilities are\nvery impressive.
Bravo!!\c\nWhat you showed us is\na spark as Trainers.\c\nHowever, let me say just one thing.\c\nWinning against us is a milestone\nin your life.\c\nYou can rack up more and more.\c\nPlease move on toward an even\ngreater goal!
Follow the rules.\nSafe driving!\c\nFollow the schedule.\nEverybody smile!\c\nCheck safety.\nEverything's ready!\c\nAim for victory!\nAll aboard!
I am Emmet.\c\nI won together with Ingo.\c\nBut if we fight again,\nwe won't know what to expect.\c\nThat's why we are waiting\nfor you to come back!
I am Emmet.\c\nI lost together with Ingo.\c\nYour combination is\nthe best--perfect!\r\nYou're verrrrry strong Trainers.\c\nYup! It was so much fun!
Let me introduce myself again.\nI am a Subway Boss, Ingo!\c\nWell, there is nothing else to say\nfor the person who comes\r\nall the way here.\c\nLet's have the greatest battle,\nbetter than ever before.
We, Ingo and Emmet, are a\ntwo-car train.\c\nThis time, we were able to work toward\na victory.\c\nWell, will you stop here?\nOr will you challenge us again?\c\nIt's up to you.\nBut let me say one thing.\c\nThere is no terminal called End\nin your life!
Bravo!!\nReally excellent!\c\nThe best combination of\nyou and your Pokémon.\r\nIt is incredible!\c\nWhen you and someone else combine,\nyour engine powers something special!\c\nIf you like, please challenge us\nwith a different combination.
What I do. What I say.\nAlways the same.\c\nFollow the rules.\nSafe driving!\c\nFollow the schedules.\nEveryone smile!\c\nCheck safety.\nEverything's ready!\c\nAim for victory!\nAll aboard!
I am Emmet.\c\nWe won, but\nI am not really satisfied.\c\nI can tell that you won't give up.\nBecause you will be much, much stronger.\c\nThat's why we are waiting\nfor you to come back!
I am Emmet.\c\nWe lost against you again.\c\nBut I am satisfied.\nYou are too strong!\c\nThe strength you have,\nyour trust in your Pokémon,\r\ntheir never-ending support!\c\nYep! It was the most fun battle ever!\nPlease come back soon!

I'm still a rookie, but someday\nI will be a great player!\c\nI'll improve by having a lot\nof Pokémon battles!\c
Ugh!\nI missed the rebound!
Hey, you might be a fan of mine.\nI'll give you this!\c
I won't make excuses for losing!\c\nWhy waste time dreaming up excuses?\nI'll spend that time getting stronger!
A young Trainer! It's important for the\nyoung to get lots of exercise, isn't it?\c
A healthy sweat...\nBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
Athletes like me are generous!\nHere, have this!\c
I want a Poké Ball that's\nas big as a basketball!\c\nI think it would be more comfortable\nfor the Pokémon inside it.
POWER!\c\nPower is essential for both\nPokémon and football!\c
Didn't I have enough power...?
I may not have enough power...\nBut I'm not lacking in kindness!\c
I am training to be the very best\nwith my Pokémon!
An elegant Smasher\nhas an elegant battle!\c
E-e-even though I lost,\nI won't panic.
I panicked!\nHere, I'll give you this!\c
Because I am a lady, I won't\nbe chagrined at losing the battle!
The qualifying round is coming soon.\c\nI will practice smashes\nby using you as a wall!\c
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\nThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\nLemme...catch...my breath...\c
You and I have just met!\nLet's start this game from the beginning.
I'm a little bit strong.\nI will work out!\c
I got worked over...
Thanks for coming to Big Stadium!\c
You're quite strong.\nYou have left the Little League!
Hey!\nHey, let's practice together!\c\nI have to warn you--I will go all out\neven if we are just practicing!\c
I was no match for you...\nThere is always someone better.
This is my thanks for training with me!\c
I promise you!\c\nI will learn from this experience\nand become an even better player!
Phew! I'll at least let my Pokémon take\nit easy on their days off!
Watching a practice makes you feel\nthat you are stronger, too,\r\ndoesn't it?\r\nSo let's have a battle!\c
Hawk: ...I could not\ndo it well at all.\c\nDar: ...I could not\ndo it right at all.
They can do even the hardest things\nas if they were so simple...\c\nThat's the great thing\nabout professionals.
We cannot have\na one-on-two battle.
We were watching various team sports,\nand we wanted to fight as a duo, too!\c
Playing as a team is difficult.\c\nWe could do more great things\nif we could understand what\r\nother people were thinking!
We would like to have\na Pokémon battle as a duo.
I get excited just by\ncoming to Small Court!!\c
Joe: I got super excited!\c\nRoss: What a thrill!\nIt's taking my breath away!
Just by being here! Just by watching it!\nI get really excited!\c\nIf I played a game here,\nI would be extremely excited!
We don't want to have\na one-on-two battle.
If we fight in this stadium,\ndon't you think we will understand\r\nhow our star players feel?\c
We had a battle with Pokémon\nin the stadium...\c\nI am happy 'cause I experienced\nwhat star players feel!
One-on-two?\nWe cannot fight like that.
Watching people practicing\nmakes me want to get moving, too!\c\nSoooooo, let's practice\nPokémon battles.\c
Masa: I laugh even though\nwe lost because it was fun!\c\nYas: Ah! I didn't cheer enough\nfor our Pokémon.
It's way more fun to have a battle\nourselves than watching\r\nother people practicing!
We cannot have\na one-on-two battle.
We usually cheer for other people,\nbut today we would like\r\nto gather our courage\r\nand have our own Pokémon battle.\c
I am not good at sports,\nbut I enjoy sports in my own way--\r\nby cheering my heart out for people!
You have only one Pokémon\nthat can fight. It's out of the question.
Watching athletes practice with Pokémon\nmade me want to have a Pokémon battle.\c
Kay: Great!\nYou are like a professional!\c\nAli: How did you know?
Ohhh... I knew it was difficult\nto fight with Pokémon as well as\r\nthe professionals do.
We are two!\nWe use two Pokémon, too!
Pokémon do\nwhat I cannot do.\c\nYou know how wonderful this is,\ndon't you?\c
Even existing sports shine\nwith new appeal\r\nwhen they team up with Pokémon!
Aren't you in trouble if you don't have\nmore Pokémon that can fight?
Which do you like better,\nbaseball or football?\c
Ami: The game ended\nbefore I knew what was going on.\c\nEira: The combination play of you\nand your Pokémon is great!
I love all kinds of sports!\c\nI can't choose just one of them, just\nlike I can't choose my favorite Pokémon.
What? You have only one\nPokémon that can fight?
We are always together!\nOur combination play must be great!\c
Be in sync with your partner,\nand with your Pokémon, too.\r\nTag Battles are tough!\c\nBut if you are in sync,\nit will be very exciting!
You have only one\nhealthy Pokémon...?
Kids! Please cooperate with the\nphysical therapy for me and my Pokémon!\c
My tackle was supposed to crush\neven Rock-type Pokémon...
This present might be more\neffective than a tackle!\c
I was injured in a rough game, so\nI am undergoing some physical therapy.
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I must still be green!\nI have plenty of guts, though!
So much guts!\nHere, I'll share with you!\c
Both my Pokémon and I\nstill haven't gotten enough practice...\r\nIn terms of levels, that would be five...
I am about to give a lecture\non the strength created by gathering\r\na proper balance of different Pokémon!\c
Bam! You lectured me!\nWhat a great Trainer!
Here's a lecture, right back at ya!\c
Team play with Pokémon\nbrought new fun to our sport.
Ugh!\nI can't take much more of this...
I am a Waiter who is good\nat Pokémon battles.\c
Wonderful battle! A learning experience.\n...Thanks for the tip!
Our specialty is the best\nPokémon battles.
Welcome!\c\nWould you like a cold drink\nwith your Pokémon battle?\c
That was a wonderful battle.\nBravo!
Invigorating Soda Pop for exhausted\nPokémon after a battle!\r\nAvailable in any vending machine!
The world is wide, and the road to glory\nis full of challenges!
To have a chance to battle with such\nstrong Pokémon...it was worth the wait!
Impressive display!\n...Shall we break for tea?
What great Pokémon you have!\nThanks so much! I had a great time!
Amazing! So that's what a Pokémon\nfrom the city is like!
Thanks for playing with me\nwhile my parents are busy!
Amazing...\nPlease, take me away with you!
First impressions are everything!
It's not over yet!\nI'll finish it my way!
I hope for a good ending! I hate endings\nthat leave a bitter taste in one's mouth!
Do you ever feel at a loss for words when\nsomething greatly moves you?\r\nTo tell the truth...\c\nI'm a writer, but right now I'm having\ntrouble putting my feelings into words.\c\nYou were just that impressive!
Now why would you use that move? If I can\nfigure that out, I may be able to win!
A beautiful loss is still a loss,\nand an ugly win is still a win!
Even in a tough situation like this,\nthere must be a way to triumph!
Where there's a winner,\nthere's also a loser.\c\nIt's pathetic to make a big deal out\nof losing if you weren't prepared.\c\nIf you're a true Pokémon battler,\nyou'll reflect upon your loss and\r\nthink about how to win next time!
I can feel it!\nYou and your Pokémon are strong!
This is my final Pokémon!\nIt all comes down to this!
Everything comes down to this next move!\nI'll use the last bit of my strength!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\nor sole best combination...\c\nThat's why it is difficult\nto keep winning.\c\nHowever, I think a heart that desires\nstrength and strives to grow\r\nstronger is a precious ideal.\c\nThat is why I respect you--\nbecause you have these things.
I have a feeling this battle will give my\nPokémon a chance to go all out!
I can't believe it's come to this!\nI must have gotten complacent.
Ohhh, that's it! I'll go all out if it'll get\nme a win!
You and your Pokémon are\nboth excellent and elegant.\c\nTo have been able to battle against\nsuch a splendid team...\c\nMy Pokémon and I learned a lot!\nI offer you my thanks.
I was expecting exactly that kind of move!
What's this?!\nThis is nothing like I expected!
Could it be?!\c\nMy plans for complete and total world\ndomination foiled yet again?\c\nNo!\c\nIt mustn't be!\c\nI couldn't have been defeated by some\nrandom Trainer from who knows where!
Our battle will surely be worth a\npage in the book of your journey!\c
If only I could have won, I would have\nbeen able to make an impression on you!
To be remembered by someone...\nThat may be what it means to be alive.
I can see the plea in my Pokémon's eyes.\nTo fight! And to win!\c
The eyes of your Pokémon\nare glimmering with strength!
I can see the plea in my Pokémon's eyes.\nThey're saying, “Get back up! I'm OK!"\c\nYep! I can understand my Pokémon's\nfeelings by looking into their eyes.
Wow!\nAmazing!
Tcha! That all you got?\nGuess it's enough...
Oh well...\nLooks like I lost!
Not bad...\nNot bad at all!
The ideal movement of living things,\nsuch pure beauty!\c\nAh, let me behold them!\c
I saw their beauty up close!
This is art!\nHere--a present for you!\c
You know, creatures that exert\nall their strength are always beautiful.
If you win against me,\nI will give you something good\r\nfrom this backpack!\c
You are great!\nAnd strong!
Here you are.\nI will give you this as I promised!\c
It feels great to run as fast as you can\nover mountains and through forests.\r\nRight?
I came here on my journey,\nbut it's kind of lively here, isn't it?\c
Is there a festival or something\ngoing on here?
This is what I found during my trip.\nI don't need it, so I will give it to you.\c
Everybody is dressed the same way.\nIs this some kind of ceremony?
I bet athletes are not satisfied\nwith their games.\c\nThat's how I feel\nwhen I watch them.\c\nThe reason? If you win against me,\nI will tell you why!\c
Are you pleased with your victory?\nOr are you unsatisfied?
This Moomoo Milk is tasty\nand so very satisfying!\c
No matter how great their play is,\nthere is always a greater play.\c\nI am never satisfied with my bread,\neven though I bake it very well.\c\nI always want to make the next\nloaf even more delicious!
A place where you can warm up!\nThat's what I heard and why I came here!\r\nLet's turn up the heat on this thing!\c
The heat here is too much.\nI'm just burning up!
Accept this symbol of my excitement!\c
My warrior's heart is burning!\nThank you for the hot battle!\c\nNext, I will stay on this hot streak\nand watch the game!
To raise healthy Pokémon, you need\nto keep their minds and bodies active,\r\nwatching games and having battles!\c
It's so frustrating to lose!\nBut it's also important to learn from it.
I just remembered something important.\nCome on now. No holding back!\c
You learn more when you lose\nthan when you win!\r\nI think it's the same for sports, too.
The Pokémon I raised are\nas good as professionals!\c
The Pokémon you raised\nare great, too!
You showed me your awesome Pokémon.\nHere, have this as my thanks.\c
There are so many ways\nto raise Pokémon.
I am not skipping work!\c
If I had known this would happen,\nI would have worked diligently.
OK!\nTime to get serious!\c
Taking a productive break\nis also part of any job!
Someone sent me a ticket, so I came.\nBut there's no game going on!\c
I have a lot of work to do.\nWhat am I doing here?
I'll give you this. That way,\nat least I'll have done something.\c
Athletes on off days are no better\nthan guys on days off.
I wonder if there are great children\nwho will become stars someday\r\nwho are now just kids at my preschool.\c
You are also quite brilliant, but\nreal stars are cool.
You seem to have potential as a star.\nSo, will you please be my friend?\c
Should I get autographs now\nfrom children who are likely to be stars?
I love sports and Pokémon most of all.\c\nHow about a battle?\nThey used to call me the Cleaner!\c
I could not stop all\nof your Pokémon's attacks...
Can you take this?\c
I used to be a Striker.\nI was responsible for scoring goals.\c\nNow I am a sweeper.\nI am responsible for sweeping floors.
The athletes' Pokémon are great!\c\nBut my Pokémon are also great!\c
Your Pokémon are also great!
In honor of our Pokémon,\nplease accept this!\c
I will strive to raise my Pokémon\nto that level!
Did you see today's game?\c\nThere was some great ballhandling by\nplayers and Pokémon!\c\nThe excitement gets me pumped\nfor a battle!\c
I lost, but I am still excited!
I'm really excited. Here,\nplease accept this gift!\c
The only place you can watch Pokémon\nenjoying sports is Nimbasa City!
When I come here, I get hyper!\nSo, let's have a battle right away!\c
I lost against you too quickly!
Here, have this!\c
When I am watching a game, I get hyper!\nI just can't sit still!
Doctor! Is there a Doctor\nin the audience?\c\nYes, I am a Doctor.\nLet's get into a battle.\c
Oh! My Pokémon is all worn out!
When Pokémon lose energy, Max Revive!\c
When I am watching a game,\nI just keep worrying about\r\nwhether an athlete will be injured.
You chose to speak to me from\namong so many people!\r\nYou have a good eye!\c
You are a worthy opponent!
The way you use moves...\nQuite honestly, I like it!\c\nHere, this is for you!\c
Heehee.\c\nEven when I am in the crowd,\npeople can tell I am strong.
I usually act like an Ace Trainer,\nbut I want to be an ordinary girl,\r\nat least when I am here.\c
I don't want to think about Pokémon\nvery much right now!
If I give you this,\nwill you leave me alone?\c
Even as an Ace Trainer, sometimes\nI just want to be an ordinary girl!\c\nI want to scream for the cool athletes,\nand enjoy my time.
Which team will score next?!\nIf you can win, I will tell you!\c
Aha!\nThat team will score next!
Aha! I've got it!\nI'll give you this!\c
My psychic power only works\nright before a player scores a point.
Heheh...\c\nThe team I want to win\nalways wins!\c
What...? Was everything up till now\njust a coincidence...?
I give this to everyone who\nmanages to beat me!\c
Feelings matter when you cheer!\nIf I believe, I feel my team will win!
Fishing is a perfectly respectable sport!\nWhy isn't there a fishing stadium?!\c
...Of course, fishing is fun\nwhen you enjoy it in nature.\c
Thanks for the fun time!\nHere's a symbol of my appreciation!\c
I like quiet nature,\nbut I like lively places like this, too.
A lot of sports started\nas Gentlemen's games!\c
Ladies and Gentlemen!\nThe game is over!
Because I am a Gentleman,\nI will present you with this gift.\c
Pokémon battles were born spontaneously\nwhen people and Pokémon\r\nfirst became friendly.
Hey, hey, did you see that? Awesome!\nA lot of famous people from TV are here!\c
Athletes are all coooool.\nI want to be like them.
You're so cool! I hope to be like you\nsomeday. Here, have this!\c
Aghhhhh. Why didn't I bring a camera,\nor a notebook for an autograph?
Sports and juggling are the same.\nYou must entertain the audience!\r\nI will show you the fruits of my practice.\c
While I am having a Pokémon battle,\nI catch 10 balls!
Here, catch this!\c
I have mastered the technique,\nbut I cannot use it!\r\nI just have to have real battles!
That incredibly flashy dorm,\nand squealing cheerleaders all around...\c\nGrrr...\nI am envious!\c
What is so great about popular athletes?\nWhat is bad about martial artists?
My feelings as a martial artist are\ncontained within this. Please have it.\c
A run-down dojo, and a lot of shouts like\nhai-ya and kee-up...\c\nIf I had known this before, I would have\nbeen a different kind of athlete.
When I grow up,\nI will be a pro athlete!\c
Waaaaah!\nI will never give you my autograph!
It's not my autograph,\nbut I'll give you this!\c
I will practice my autograph\nfor when I go pro!
My daddy is\nan athlete here!\c
Waaaaaah. Dadddddddy.
My daddy gave this to me...\nBut you can have it!\c
...I won't cry.\n'Cause I promised my daddy.
Even Socialites enjoy sports,\nin a very elegant way!\c\nA Pokémon battle is\na sport in a way!\r\nLet's fight elegantly!\c
O-ho-ho!\nI lost so elegantly.
Oh dear, I mistook this for a ball\nand ordered it. Now it's yours.\c
First of all, we should enjoy\nsports and Pokémon battles!\c\nIf you get hung up on winning and losing,\nyou lose sight of what is most valuable.
I will be strong in Pokémon battles,\nand I will marry a professional athlete!\c
Ah.\nI still have a long way to go!
Your Pokémon are strong. I will give\nsomething good to a strong person!\c
Strong people are always totally\nattractive. Don't you think?
A Hiker, an athlete,\nand a Pokémon Trainer.\r\nDo you know what is important?\c
Grrrrrrr!\nClearly you know it!
Since you know, I'll give you\nsomething nice!\c
Prepare thoroughly.\nIf you don't, you can't do anything!
I can't believe nobody has noticed me...\nI am a star!\c
Don't look at me. I lost!
Please! I'll give you this!\nJust please, don't look at me!\c
Whose autograph do you want?\nDon't you want one of mine?
You are energetic!\nI will punish lazy children!\c
You just don't quit!\nYou are so energetic!
OK! An energetic Trainer!\nTake this!\c
Nurses need plenty of stamina,\nboth day and night!
My darling is working here.\nHow about that? Are you envious?\c
My darling is seriously the best.\nHe puts athletes to shame.
Here, I'll show the greatness\nof my darling to you!\c
My darling is a Janitor!\nHe cleans this entire big place\r\nby himself every day. Cool, huh?\r\nNobody else can do what he does.
Games in the rain look extra tough,\ndon't they?\c\nI wonder what Pokémon battles\nin rain are like.\c
Well, this place is indoors,\nso they don't get rained out.
We may not get rainfall in here, but\nnice things can still pour down!\c
If a stadium has a roof,\nthey can play a game anytime!
Hey! It's me! It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in Unova!\c
You! You are daring!\nBe my apprentice!
Here! I'll give you this, so\nbecome my apprentice!\c
A once-in-a-lifetime flight!\nFly, fly, and fly away!
If you want to know what the VIP seats\nare like, you'd better beat me!\c
VIP seats are very far away\nfrom the athletes!
VIP! VIP!\nV...I...P!\c
I could see the game fine, but\nthe athletes looked like grains of rice.
You!\nYou are a fan of that person.\c\nI can tell!\nBut that person is mine!\c
Oh no, oh why?\nI am sorry...
I can't let you have that person,\nbut take this instead...\c
Come to think of it,\nthe more supporters there are,\r\nthe better.\c\nYou! Cheer until you lose your voice,\nand clap until your hands fall off!
When I am watching a game,\nI feel like I should be moving, too!\c
That was a good workout!
Oohh! I can't stop moving!\c
The stadium is nice, but I'd sure\nlove to play sports outdoors!
I want to drag people here\nand have them enlist as Pokémon Rangers.\c
Wow! Electrifying!\nYou are so goooood!
To the incredible “Y...O...U."\c
You! Be a Pokémon Ranger!\nI will give you a good workout!
Watch a game\nduring a study break!\c\nHave a battle\nduring a game break!\c
Gah!\nThis is so not relaxing!
I'll try doing this to see if\nI can't switch gears!\c
When I come here for fun,\nI can study more efficiently!
OK, I decided!\nIf I win against you,\r\nI will be a Gym Leader!\c
Ummmm...\nMaybe I'm not ready to be a Gym Leader?
You taught me a lot, so please\naccept this as a symbol of my thanks!\c
I have to consider what I will be\nby trying a lot of things!
I wonder if being good at sports\nand being good at battles are related?\c
It was very helpful...
Ummmm. You are\nquite interesting.\c\nPlease have this!\c
Both sports and Pokémon are\nlike a science for me!
I am stuck inside the lab,\nwith a medicinal smell every day,\r\nand then I get stressed out.\c
Waaaaaahhh! Frustrating!
Breaking out made me feel better!\nHere's a token of my appreciation.\c
Let's have another Pokémon battle\nsometime, so we won't be stressed out!
These are not shorts!\nThese are half pants!\c
You were so strong that\nmy half pants almost fell down!
You are awesome!\nHere's an awesome gift for you!\c
I envy basketball players.\n'Cause they wear shorts, not half pants.\c\nBut baseball and football\nuniforms are also cool!
Mmm!\nYou smell like an athlete!\c
I see. That is the smell\nthat strong people give off...
You seem to be getting even stronger...\nOK. Please take this.\c
I hope you will get even stronger\nby using it.
Wow, you have a lot of Badges.\nLet me see your skills!\c
That fighting style reminds me\nof the old days!
A person like you should use\ntop-shelf items--like this!\c
No matter how old we get,\nlet's stay Trainers!
Cheering makes us\nthirsty. Right?\c\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll give you a drink!\c
The battle made me\neven thirstier!
Here you are.\nI will give you something good!\c
At a place like this,\nit's good to drink a lot of water!
Cheering makes us\nthirsty. Right?\c\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll give you a drink!\c
The battle made me\neven thirstier!
Here you are.\nI will give you something good!\c
At a place like this,\nit's good to drink a lot of water!
Let's have a battle on these grounds,\nwhich I keep looking sharp!\c
The best battle\non the best ground!
And here is the best gift!\c
OK! I will keep the grounds\nlooking perfect!
This air of excitement brings back\nmemories. In those days, I was also...\c
It makes my old wound ache...
My wound aches...\c
I may not look like it,\nbut I used to be quite an athlete.
Are you a criminal?!\c
Oh, you are not a criminal...\nSorry! Lo siento!
Hey! Come on!\nI'll give you this, so cheer up!\c
I'm here because I heard someone\naround here was faking points.
What? A battle at a place like this?\nWait! Everybody is watching us!\c
Well, thanks to you,\nI overcame my stage fright.
Well... OK, then. I'll just have\nto overcome my anxiety... Here!\c
What? Nobody is watching me?\nNooooo. Look at me, please!
I want you to tell me something!\c
You showed me your full strength!
I got it! Here, have this! I bet you'll\nbe able to use it to its full potential!\c
I will work at the Battle Subway\nfrom now on, but...\r\nwhere is it?
I want to play tennis\nlike a strong athlete!\c
Joe: A no-point game\nagainst you 'cause you're strong...\c\nRoss: A no-point game\n'cause we could not win at all!
I want to be as good a Cyclist\nas a strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\nThen, we cannot have a battle.
I want to play ball\nlike a strong athlete!\c
I want to learn more from\na strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\nI prefer a doubles match.
Whoosh! Whoosh!\nI can fight like that!\c
Joe: Fffffft...\nFffffft, fffffft... The ball needs air.\c\nRoss: Faaaault!\nI missed a serve!
They can keep moving\nfor such a long time.\c\nSmashers are really great!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
Hah!\c\nDid you see my power serve?\c\nAnd my Pokémon is\neven stronger!\c
The person who controls his serves\ncontrols the game.\r\nI will practice my serves a bit more.
Hah!
I love to watch professionals play!\nYaaaay! I won't lose, either!\c
Ai: What?\nDid we lose...?\c\nCiel: Ouch... I knew watching a game and\nplaying it are different!
Watching a professional game\nmakes me strangely confident!
Exciting!
I want to move elegantly, too!\nHey! Have a battle with me!\c
When professionals are playing,\nit looks so easy...
Thrilling!
Oh!\c\nAthletes are looking over this way!\nLet's have a battle to impress them.\c
Masa: Agghhh!\nWe showed them an embarrassing scene.\c\nYas: Hurrah! Hurrah!\nMy Pokémon! What...?
I thought they were looking at us, but\nthey were looking at their opponents...
Is that athlete looking at me?\nNo, he's not.
If I win in a Pokémon battle,\ncheer for this team.\c
I lost, so I will cheer for you!\c\nHurray! Hurray! Go you go!\nHustle! Hustle! Go you go!
Ummmm. The cheering for this team\nis not nearly loud enough...
Look at this buff body!\nAnd the Pokémon that support it!\c\nLet's have a Pokémon battle\nto show off my greatness!\c
Masa: The greatness of basketball...\nI think you got it.\c\nYas: Shall we curl up\nlike balls?
The important thing in basketball\nis outstanding teamwork!
Hmph! Hmph!\c\nFirst-class athletes\nspeak with their backs.
The way the athletes scramble\nfor that ball...\c\nI wish they'd fight over me that way!\c
From the ball's point of view,\nit's like, please don't fight over me!
The way the athletes scramble\nfor that ball...\c\nI wish they'd fight over me that way!
If you win, I will tell you\nwhy I like basketball!\c
Kat: Come on!\c\nPhae: Look! Even though we lost,\nthe ball is still spinning!
When you are watching basketball,\nit reminds you of fruit in a basket,\r\nand it looks delicious. Right?
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,\nyou need to have two Pokémon.
My special skill is that I can\nspin a ball on my finger.\r\nI can spin it forever!\c
I want to have Poké Balls\nwith the same designs as\r\nthe balls used in sports!
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,\nyou need to have two Pokémon.
Look!\nMy defense is magnificent!\c
Hawk: It's strange. When professionals\nare playing, it looks so easy...\c\nDar: I guess we cannot play\nquite as well as the professionals...
Rock-solid defense!\nThat's a real thrill in football!
DE-fense! DE-fense!
Look!\nMy magnificent offense!\c
Offense that smashes in every direction!\nThat's a real thrill in football!
Offffffense!
The bond of football fans\nis stronger than any tackle!\c
Hawk: The bond between you and\nyour Pokémon is strong, too!\c\nDar: This feeling will go well past\nthe goal line...
Football is knockdown amazing because\nyou can feel the excitement--the bond\r\nbetween players and the crowd!
Our bond as fans\nis way stronger than this!
My cheer will go over the goal line\nand will be heard for a million miles!\c
When I cheer for my team\nuntil I get thirsty,\r\nFresh Water tastes even better!
Come on! Cheer louder!\nYell! Yell!
I mainly play on offense.\nMy friend is mainly defense.\c\nI will show you the teamwork\nof football fans!\c
Cam: The teamwork of your Pokémon\nis outstanding!\c\nAbby: I'm super impressed!
If what you want to do is different\nfrom what your partner wants to do,\r\nit's hard to win a Double Battle!
You know, football is a team sport!\nPlease prepare at least two Pokémon!
Double Battles!\c\nThis is the best way to feel\nthe heat of the game of football!\c
The right play can turn a game around...\nPokémon battles are the same, too!
Double Battles!\c\nYou need at least two Pokémon\nto feel the heat of the game of football!
Boom-boom-badum! Ha! Boom-boom-badum!\nListen to the fans' drumbeat!\c
Les: Thank you for listening to the beat\nof our spirit!\c\nWeb: Thank you for listening to the yell\nof our spirit!
Ha, pan-pan-papan, hey-hoo!!\nNext, we will use this rhythm!
Bam-bam-bam! Ha! Bam-bam-bam!\nI see the end coming?
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo Ta-raaa!\nListen to the fans shout!\c
Pan, pan-papan, hey-oo!! Right?\nOh, the rhythm is wonderful!
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo ta-raaa!\nListen to the fans shout!
Olé, olé, oléeee!\nThis is the fan song I wrote!\c\nThe Pokémon listening to this song\ntry harder than usual!\c
Kay: Olé, olé...\nHuh? It's over.\c\nAli: You are very strong!
“Olé!" means\n“Go!" or “Move forward!"
Olé, olé, oléeee!\nI am cheering now!\c\nIf you have two Pokémon,\nI don't mind battling with you!
My friend came here with me...\nShe comes 'cause she wants to sing\r\nmore than cheering for the team.\c
I am a fan of all the players\nwho are doing their best!\r\nSo, I want both teams to win!
With only one Pokémon,\nit's a bit hard to battle.
Hey, you!\nDo you know what offside means?\c
Kay: What we just saw is offside!\nI bet it's offside!\c\nAli: B... Baaaaah!\nI won't tell you anymore!
What? What is offside?\nEr... The girl next to me knows!
Off!
Hey, shall I tell you\nabout the offside penalty?\c
Offside is when...\nEr... The girl next to me will explain!
Side!
The bases loaded with two outs\nin the bottom of the ninth inning...\r\nAfter that... Isn't that obvious?\c
Alf: Strike!\nGame over! Yes, the end!\c\nFred: Ah, my Poké Ball!
A game-winning homer...\nWe always hope for that clutch play!
Striiiiike!!
I don't have a home-run ball,\nbut I do have a Poké Ball!\c
I wish I could catch a home-run ball\njust once!
Ball!
Hit a home run!\c
Ami: We're slammed.\c\nEira: I'm going home.
Elesa's fashion sense\nis funky, too.
A one-on-two battle is\ntoo funky!
Hey, what does “long ball" mean?\c
What I heard is\nit means a home run.\c\n“Homer" also\nmeans a home run!
We two battle together, so\nyou need two Pokémon!
Hey, you!\c\nDon't smile at my favorite player.\c
Ami: Argh! We lost,\nand it's your fault.\c\nEira: You should try harder.\nDon't drag me down.
The only thing we have in common\nis that we like the same team.\c\nBut really, isn't that the most\nimportant thing for a fan?
Argh, because of you,\nwe're in a big pinch.
Argh, annoying!\c\nIt's none of your business\nwho I cheer for.\c
Our teamwork is sooooo bad,\nexcept when we cheer during games.\c\nBut we really don't care\nabout any time but game time.
No way! Argh, we are losing\nbecause you are not really trying!
I am quite strong.\nI will work out today, too!\c
I... I got worked over.
Thanks for coming to Big Stadium again!\c
Your strength!\nYou pack quite a punch!
POWER!!\c\nIf you have power that nobody can beat,\nyou can win both Pokémon battles\r\nand football games!\c
I...still don't have enough power?
I may still not have enough power,\nbut I'm not short on kindness!\c
Mmmm... Maybe I should\ntrain more...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I am still such a rookie!\nBut I have more guts than anybody else!
I've got more than enough guts!\nTime to share it with others!\c
My Pokémon and I still haven't\npracticed enough...\c\nTo put it in levels, we're maybe a 10...
I am stronger than ever.\nI will work out today, too!!\c
I got worked over.
Thanks for coming to Big Stadium!\c
A swing and a miss...\nI can't keep up with your strength!
POWER!!!\c\nWith my ripped muscles,\nI will overcome everything!\c
I still don't have\nenough muscles...?!
I may not have enough power...\nBut I'm not lacking in kindness!\c
Maybe I should change\nmy training regimen...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I'm still such a rookie!\nI have more than enough guts, though!
It's sharing time yet again for\nmy copious amount of guts!\c
My Pokémon and I\nstill haven't practiced enough...\r\nTo put it in levels, we're about a 20...
I am the strongest.\nI will work out today, too!!\c
I...got worked over!
Thanks for always coming to Big Stadium!\c
Your strength is\nhome-run class!
POWER!!!!\c\nI will win! My superior power\ncan blaze any trail!\c
Is it possible that just having power\nis not enough...?
I may not have enough power...\nBut I'm not lacking in kindness!\c
Football games and Pokémon battles\nboth require power and technique.
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I am such a rookie!\nI've got more guts, though!
I've got enough of the strongest kind\nof guts. I'll share them with you again!\c
My Pokémon and I still\nhaven't practiced enough...\r\nTo put it in levels, we're maybe a 50...
I've practiced and practiced\nand become a great player!\r\nNow, let's play ball!\c
Game over!
Here's a gift to show my thanks to\nyou for coming!\c
Now, practice, practice, practice!\c\nPracticing over and over is the best way\nto be good at anything!\c\nMy hard work will make me a great player!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\nspecial training for my Pokémon!\c
My block was supposed to guard\nagainst even Steel-type Pokémon...
This gift might be more effective\nthan my block!\c
Physical therapy is over,\nso we're doing some special training.
Let me tell you about the strength\nof the team you create when\r\nyou put a strong Pokémon at the core.\c
...You taught me!\nYou are great!
I can give a pretty\ngreat lecture, too!\c
It looks like a team built around\na strong Pokémon--that is, an ace--\r\nhas advantages and disadvantages.
Together, my Pokémon and I\nare the world's strongest!!\c
Wow! I didn't think anyone could\ncatch my blazing fastball!
Try to catch this!\c
My fastballs are so fast,\nnobody can hit them.\c\nVery few can catch my fastballs\nexcept Pokémon.
I, I...\nI'm not fat, am I?\c
Ripped!
Ripped, I tell you!\c
I am ripped!\nI am not fat.
I have great footwork with the ball.\nPoké Balls, too. See?\c
After I let Pokémon out of\nPoké Balls... Well, I am still practicing...
Handling items is a piece of cake!\c
I should practice more\non Pokémon handling, too.
I play occasionally,\nbut I want to become a better player!\c\nSo I will fight\na lot of Pokémon battles, too!\c
UGHH!\nI couldn't even pass the ball!
Hey, you might be a fan of mine.\nI'll give you this!\c
I will do anything to play better!\nIt's over if you get complacent!
An elegant Smasher\nhas an elegant battle!\c
E-e-e-even though I lost,\nI will not panic.
I panicked!\nSo, here, have this!\c
Because I am a lady, I won't be,\nwell, you know,\r\nch-ch-chagrined at losing.\r\nWell, maybe a teensy little bit.
I am in the starting lineup now,\nbut I will be even better soon!\c\nI will practice with a lot\nof Pokémon battles!\c
UGHH!\nMy field positioning was terrible!
But my passing technique is great!\c
If I think about why I made a mistake\nand correct it, I'll make fewer mistakes.\c\nAnd if I work to improve my strength,\nI'll get even stronger!
As a proper lady, I am elegant\nall the way down to my toes!\c
Wahhhhh! What is this??
I even give gifts in an elegant fashion!\c
Oh! I am a lady,\nyet I have lost my nerve...
I've always played games,\nbut now I want to be the best player!\c\nI will practice with a lot of\nPokémon battles!\c
UGHH! I missed the basket!\nI was blocked!!
I'm gonna throw this item,\nso you'd better block it!\c
I won't give up games!\nI won't accept limits!\c\nNobody can stop me\nas long as I want to improve!
I am a lady. I will challenge others\nto battle elegantly!\c
You should...\nGo easy on me!
I even give gifts in an elegant fashion!\c
B-b-b-because I am a lady...\nwaaaah...\r\nI will admit my defeat gracefully...
No matter how much I sweat,\nI won't smell sweaty!\c
A healthy sweat...\nBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
Here's what us athletes\ndo as a greeting!\c
After a battle, take a bath!\nAfter eating, brush your teeth!
The world championships are coming soon!\nI will practice volleys\r\nby using you as a wall!\c
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\nThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\nLemme...catch...my breath...\c
You and I have just met.\nLet's start the game from the beginning!
Hey! Trainer!\c\nI will strike you from above.\nMy attack has a height!\c
That's right.\nThe Pokémon do the fighting, not me...
How about this one?\nIt's got quite a flavor!\c
We always play basketball\nwith Pokémon here!
I will show you a powerful serve!\nWatch this burn in at 120 miles per hour!\c
Your attack just now...\nMore powerful!
How about a powerful present?\c
Pokémon are sending over\nsome powerful serves so I can practice.
Oh!\nMy groundbreaking research...
You're not bad!
Nice!\nYou're really good!
Oh ooohhh...
Wow!
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.\nJust kidding!
Ahhh, that was fun!\nBut now I've got to get back to cleaning!
It's important to make a good first\nimpression on your opponent!
It's the final chapter!\nHere's my last Pokémon!
I really want a happy ending this time!\nI hate endings that leave a bitter taste.
Wow. I'm stunned.\c\nFor all the words I know, I can't figure out\nhow to say this... Putting my feelings\r\ninto words would just be a trap.\c\nAll I will say is I feel you're even greater\nthan I thought!
I never thought you would use that move...\nNot a bad choice at all.
Those who give up on themselves\ncan never claim victory!
There's got to be a way to win...\nEven in the most extreme of conditions!
Which Pokémon should I raise?\c\nWhich moves should I teach my Pokémon?\c\nWhat items should I give my Pokémon?\c\nYou need to think everything through very\nthoroughly if you want to win!\c\nIn that sense, you're a very\nimpressive battler!
Oh! Strong as usual.\nThat makes my heart dance!
I may have only one Pokémon remaining,\nbut its strength knows no limits!
I'll put everything I have into\nthis next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\nor sole best combination...\c\nThat's why it is difficult\nto keep winning.\c\nHowever, I think a heart that desires\nstrength and strives to grow\r\nstronger is a precious ideal.\c\nThat is why I respect you--\nbecause you have these things.
I will show you how harmonious\nmy Pokémon and I are!
Battling in extreme conditions\nlike this makes me stronger!
I will control my emotions and use them\nas energy to help me obtain victory!
As impressive as always...\c\nNo. You and your Pokémon were even\nmore elegant and excellent than before!\c\nTo have been able to battle against\nsuch a splendid team...\c\nMy Pokémon and I learned so much!\nI offer you my thanks.\r\nPlease battle me again sometime.
When was the last time\nI was driven into a corner like this?
You haven't won yet! I won't let\nsuch a fun battle end so easily!
My heart is pounding so hard because I had\nsuch a heated battle with you.\c\nYou are a really great Trainer!!
What do you think? This Pokémon Gym...\nHow should I say? Isn't it full of...\r\noutrageous and mysterious charms?\c
You've got quite a bit of charm\nyourself, don't you?
Look carefully at the direction in which\nthe string extends from the cocoon.\c\nFind the end of the string, and\nproceed in that direction!
...That's right.\nI was taking a nap inside the cocoon!
You thought you could get\nthrough here? Think again!\c\nOr so you thought!\nI'm just blocking your way!\c
My, my...\nAren't you a bit too strong?
Keep this a secret between you and me...\c\nDepending on which side you enter\nthe cocoon, you will come out somewhere\r\ndifferent on the other end.
You're just one step away from\nbeing able to challenge Burgh!\c\nBut, before that, I have to\ntry to stop you!\c
Your battling style is almost\nas artistic as Burgh!
Burgh remodeled this Gym in order to\nbetter understand the feelings Pokémon\r\nthat wrap themselves in cocoons have.\c\n...Unfortunately, we can never seem to\nfind our way around as a result.
Strong winds, right?\c\nIt represents the strength of us\nand our Gym Leader!\c\nThis is a Pokémon Gym! Let's have\nus a Pokémon battle!\c
I felt some intense pressure coming\nfrom you and your Pokémon!
I'll give you some advice.\c\nIf the floor is colored differently and\nyou're surrounded by walls, you probably\r\nwon't get blown away by the wind.
My Pokémon is stronger than the wind.\nIt's my pride and joy!\c
It may be stronger than the wind, but my\nPokémon isn't as strong as yours.
I became a Pilot so I could soar through\nthe skies alongside my flying Pokémon!
Sometimes you need to be bold,\nwhile other times you need to be careful.\c\nYou'll have to react accordingly if you\ndon't want to be blocked by the traps\r\nin this Gym!\c
I couldn't block your path...\nYou're an impressive Trainer!
If you see the devices around you\nstart to spin quickly, you should hurry\r\nand find a place to hide from the wind!
If you can beat me, you'll be able\nto face the Gym Leader...\c\nYou're too careless if you think that!\nDon't let your guard down yet!\c
How could this be?!\nI wasn't being careless at all!
Landing is the hardest part about\npiloting a plane. You'd better stay\r\nalert until the very end!
Right side clear! Left side clear!\c\nBattle flight is ready for takeout!\c\nErr... I mean takeoff!\c
Unfortunately...we are forced to land.
How far can you fly in the\nface of strong winds?\c\nHigh performance is important for planes,\nbut perhaps feelings are what's\r\nimportant for people and Pokémon.
To have chosen that move...\nI see! You'll be a powerful opponent!
As a Gym Leader, I aim to be a wall for\nyou to overcome!
This! This is what a real\nPokémon battle is!
I can feel your desire to win\npouring out of you!
It's not over yet! Time to turn\nthis show around for a victory!
Wait!\nI was right in the middle of the chorus!
Lights, please! Time to show you\nwhat Bug-type Pokémon are made of!
Mmm... I've got a bad feeling about this!\nCould I be in trouble?
Hmm... It's over!\nYou're incredible!
You and your Pokémon's moves\nare simply dazzling!
I've got to overcome this situation!\nI can't let my fans down!
You shocked me through and through!\nYou melted my heart!
Impressive!\nThat's some strength you've got!
No hard feelings, but\nI'm extremely stubborn!
Man oh man... It feels good to go all\nout and still be defeated!
When I think about how you might\nattack, it's like I'm walking on air!
Never give up! To do so is an insult to the\nPokémon who fight for you!
I won't forget this battle!\nI'm glad that I could fight against you!
Whatever move you chose, it fills me with the\nheat of battle!
My blood burns with even more fire at this\nage! I've still got some fight in me!
This bitterness that floods me after\na defeat...\c\nThe heart that does not succumb to such a\nfeeling is filled with energy and life!
Dude...\nYou're really into this, huh!
Awww, dude... I know I'm about done,\nbut I'm still just so pumped up!
You totally rocked that!\nYou're raising some wicked Pokémon.\r\nYou got this Trainer thing down!
I won't forget the pain you just\nput my partner through!
I've just got to trust my\npartner to pull off this move!
I couldn't achieve victory for my partner...\nI won't let myself forget this frustration!
I won't forget the pain you just\nput my partner through!
I've just got to trust my\npartner to pull off this move!
I couldn't achieve victory for my partner...\nI won't let myself forget this frustration!
I won't forget the pain you just\nput my partner through!
I've just got to trust my\npartner to pull off this move!
I couldn't achieve victory for my partner...\nI won't let myself forget this frustration!
You can tell how much your opponent\nwants to fight by looking into his or her\r\neyes, don't you think?\c
Wow! I could really tell\nthat you wanted to win!
I'm gonna keep battling to make\nmy Pokémon stronger!
Hey, you! Have you seen my cute\nPokémon? Take a look!\c
My Purrloin is cute even if it loses!
Maybe I'll try a wild Pokémon next time\nso that I can win...
Come on, partner! Shrug it off!\nYou're stronger than that!
We're still OK!\nWe can keep going!
It can't be!\c\nHow could I have lost?\nI need to apologize to my partner...
Come on, partner! Shrug it off!\nYou're stronger than that!
We're still OK!\nWe can keep going!
It can't be!\c\nHow could I have lost?\nI need to apologize to my partner...
Come on, partner! Shrug it off!\nYou're stronger than that!
We're still OK!\nWe can keep going!
It can't be!\c\nHow could I have lost?\nI need to apologize to my partner...
You sure are unlucky to have\nrun into someone as strong as me!\c
I guess it was I who was unlucky\nto have run into you!
Turning bad luck into good luck...\nI wish I knew how to do that.
Let's see who has the\nmost admirable Pokémon!\c
Even though we lost, my Pokémon\nare still pretty admirable...
If we can't win with these numbers,\nmaybe I should find my Pokémon\r\nsome more friends!
Oh! I haven't seen you before!\nWould you mind sparring with me?\c
Wow! Astounding! For one so young,\nyou're quite impressive, indeed!
Look carefully around the ranch and on\nthe roads, and you might find items on\r\nthe ground!
I need to get Alder to teach me\nsome more things...
I need to get Alder to teach me\nsome more things...
I need to get Alder to teach me\nsome more things...
What?! How could I have lost in a\ntype matchup like this?
What?! How could I have lost in a\ntype matchup like this?
What?! How could I have lost in a\ntype matchup like this?
You're strong! Or should I say\nyour Pokémon are strong?
For knowledge to truly become your own,\nyou've got to test it out for yourself!
I'm the strongest Trainer in\nVirbank City's preschool!\c
I guess I'm not the strongest in the world!
I know! I'll go home and take a nap!\nMom always says that I need to get lots\r\nof sleep if I want to be a big kid!
Hi there! Look at my awesome Pokémon.\c
I...I'm not mad!
My Pokémon will always be with me,\neven if we lose!
Two Pokémon!\c\nStrong and strong come together\nto become...very strong!\c
Lia: Wahh! My Pokémon can't fight\nany longer?\c\nLily: Uh oh... My Pokémon isn't\nlooking so well...
I don't know when I'm supposed\nto use Potions and stuff...
One Pokémon all alone?\nBut it'll be sad...
Ummm...\nOne plus one...isn't three!\c
I heard something really cool!\c\nThere are moves where two\nPokémon can attack at once!
One Pokémon all alone?\nBut it'll be sad...
I always give it my best when I'm\naround kids and Pokémon!\c
Oh no! I'm not being a very good\nexample to the kids, am I?
Every day is full of amazing, new\ndiscoveries when I'm with children\r\nand Pokémon!
Ahh!\nHow merciless...
Get in my way, and I'll knock you out!\nStay out of my way...and I'll knock\r\nyou out, too!\c
I'm the one who got knocked out!\nThat was exhilarating!
Hahaha! You're great!\nKnock 'em all out for me, OK?
I can always be straight and honest\nwith myself whenever I'm playing the\r\nguitar or having a Pokémon battle!\c
Argh! The happy times always end\nso quickly!
It's because I'm with my Pokémon that\nI can happily play my guitar.\c\nAnd it's because I play my guitar that\nmy Pokémon become strong. Get it?
Is this what it means to face reality?
I don't mind losing, but I\nfeel sorry for my Pokémon...
Speaking of which, it's been quite some time\nsince I last had a Pokémon battle.
Sure, I'll be your opponent!\nRight alongside my trusty Woobat!\c
Wow!\nHow powerful!
This is one of my favorite places!
All right! Time for a Pokémon battle!\nLet's begin!\c
Whew!\nYou're way too strong!
Time for some special Pokémon\ntraining in the dark tall grass!
I'm gonna get a lot stronger\nso I can impress Roxie!\c
Ah haha...\nIt can't be true...
I want to get a lot stronger\nso I can impress Roxie!
Welcome to the Nimbasa City Gym, where\nPokémon and Trainers come together to\r\nput on magnificent Pokémon battles!\c\nLet the fashion show begin!\c
The show has just begun...\c\n...What? It's over already?
You and your Pokémon were\npositively shining!
You can't get by with just beauty!\nYou need to be a strong Trainer, too!\c\nDon't get captivated by the magnificent\nbeauty of our battling style!\c
...Strong and beautiful!\nYou captivated me!
Beauty isn't just about one's\nphysical appearance!\c\nYour strength is part of your beauty!\nThat goes for both you and Elesa!
The show is approaching its grand finale,\nbut first I need to check if you've got\r\nwhat it takes to stand on the same\r\nstage as Elesa!\c
Such strength and beauty!\c\nYou've got what it takes to\nshare the stage with Elesa!
What a fantastically elegant show!\c\nThe Pokémon battle between you and\nElesa was absolutely magnificent!\r\nI was utterly captivated!
You've been caught by a powerful hook,\nwhich is me!\c\nI'll have a battle with you using\nmy freshly caught Pokémon!\c
I just can't help but flop about!\nFlip flop flip flop flip!
I like to think that I'm not catching\nPokémon against their will, but that\r\nthey cling to my hook because they\r\nwant to battle me!
OK! Good catch! Good catch!\nMy next catch will be called victory!\c
The victory that got away\nwas thiiiiiiiiiis big!
Life is just like fishing.\c\nYou can't catch what you don't aim for,\nbut even if you aim for something, you\r\nstill can't catch it!
Having lots of battles is the best\nway to train a Pokémon quickly!\c
Your training method is great!\nI'm going to copy it!
I want to battle you each time\nyou come here! Got it?
Ah, that smell?\c\nMy Herdier here seems to say that\nyou've got a dangerous smell about you!\c
I see... Your strength is\ncertainly quite dangerous...
Just because you're strong doesn't mean\nyou can look down on those who aren't!
Hey there! Trainer!\nLet's battle!\c
Thank you! This will prove to be\na great memory of my journey!
Stick up a thumb to stop a car.\nMake eye contact to stop a Trainer.
Hey, you!\nStop right there!\c
There's no stopping you!\nOne might call you unstoppable!
Go all out while you're still young!
What's a kid like you doing\nwandering around these parts?\c
To have bested an officer like me...\nWhat kind of kid are you?!
An officer's job is to keep patrolling\neven when nothing's going on!
This ain't no place for\nkids like you!\c
Just who are you?\nYou looked pretty timid...
All I know is that if you're a Trainer,\nyou're gonna get challenged!
My shiny head is a reflection\nof my fighting spirit!\c
My shine is set to blind!
My dumb little brother decided to follow\nin my footsteps and become a bad dude.\c\nI really wanted him to grow up\nand live respectably, though...
A motorcycle in the desert!\nDoesn't get much more wild than this, eh?\c
Motorcycles aren't compatible with sand.\nI'm not compatible with you!
Both bicycles and motorcycles get\ntheir tires stuck in the sand!
Starting yesterday, I decided\nto become a bad dude!\r\nNow people will know I'm strong!\c
I guess I can't just up and decide to be\na bad dude... It's tougher than I thought!
I want to be like my big bro\nand have a shiny head!\c\nYou don't have to waste time\ndrying your hair after a shower!
Hey, hey!\nWe'll take care of you!\c
Rob: My...my cute little Pokémon!\c\nSal: My baby lost!
Some cute Pokémon you've got there!\c\nYou aren't too shabby\nof a Trainer, either!
Hrmph! I don't want to fight someone\nwho has only got one Pokémon that's\r\nready for battle!
Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong?\nAre you lost or something?\c
Us bad dudes are getting together\nto boast about our Pokémon!
Come on! You're telling me that you've\nonly got one Pokémon ready for battle?\c\nI can't call myself a bad dude if I fight\ntwo against one! It's not fair at all!
My gorgeous Pokémon and I have come\nto frolic about Relic Castle! Here, take\r\na look at my Pokémon!\c
Your strength is quite high class, indeed!
Visiting famous landmarks with\nmy most favorite Pokémon is a\r\ntruly exceptional experience!
You there!\c\nI've become bored, so I shall\nlet you entertain me!\c
Well, you certainly know how to entertain.\nI thank you for your time.
All I see is sand all around me...\nI cannot understand the appeal of\r\nsuch a place!
A ruin buried under the sand!\nTo have run into another Trainer here!\r\nDoesn't this give you a grand sense\r\nof adventure?\c
Bittersweet defeat becomes\na bittersweet memory...
It's a lot of fun to imagine how people in\nancient times lived their everyday lives!
What kind of Pokémon is your\npartner on this journey?\c
Wow! What an amazing and\nstrong friend you've got!
They say that a good companion makes the\njourney pleasant, but it's really true!\c\nWhen you're with Pokémon, the fun factor\njust multiplies, don't you think?
This may be a bit sudden, but please,\ncheck out my Pokémon!\c
Even if my Pokémon lose,\nthey are still so cute!
Anytime, anywhere, no matter what,\nmy Pokémon are always the best for me!
Hee hee! Hey, you! Check out\nmy Pokémon before you go!\c
What brilliant Pokémon!\nThank you for the battle!
I feel a bit down when I lose,\nbut I also feel that each battle with\r\nmy Pokémon strengthens our bond!
Aynshunt!\nIt's aynshunt!\c
Tara: Wahh! But it's aynshunt!\c\nVal: No, it's a roo-in!
Aynshunt means a long time ago, right?\nDoes that mean yesterday is aynshunt?
You only have one Pokémon?\nYou need more! I like lots of Pokémon!
Roo-in!\nIt's a roo-in!\c
A roo-in is like someone's house, right?\nI wonder who lives here?
You only have one Pokémon?\nIsn't it lonely?
After watching a football game, we want\nto get rowdy ourselves!\c
Ava: You defeated us so soundly\nthat even I feel refreshed!\c\nAya: I cheered as best I could...
Keeping track of wins and losses is\nimportant, but don't lose sight of\r\neverything else as a result!
We can't have any teamwork if you've\ngot only one Pokémon ready for battle!
Knowing what a truly heated\nbattle is all about is the key to\r\ntruly passionate cheering!\c
A fan needs to be 100 percent serious\nabout both battles and cheering!
You can't show off your teamwork if you\nonly have one Pokémon ready for battle!
These Pokémon usually help me bake.\nToday, they'll help me battle you!\c
Oh, my! Battling sure is much\nmore difficult than baking!
I get on well with my Pokémon, and we\nbake bread together. It's so much fun!\r\nI don't mind getting up early every day.
Art is explosions! Life forces\ncolliding together!\c
Oh, I just got whitewashed!
Boom!\c\nColors collide to form new colors!
Turn around, and it's my turn. ♪\nTurn around, and it's your turn.\c
Turn around, turn around, turn around...\nThen turn around some more!
My Pokémon just love participating\nin musicals! They are masters of dance!
Whatever the case, it's best to\ntry something for yourself!\c
Hmm... I guess strumming instead of tapping\nwould have been best...
You're a strong Trainer!\nI'm a great Guitarist!\r\nWe're both pretty awesome!
I can feel it in the air...\nThis battle will be electrifying!\c
What electrifying strength!\nYou shocked me good!
Give this Berry to your Pokémon!\c
If a Pokémon holding a Cheri Berry gets\nhit with paralysis, it will eat the Berry\r\nand recover!
OK!\nTomorrow will be a home run!\c
Stu: We lost! Time to walk off...\c\nArt: Farewell! You won...
Your Pokémon certainly have\nwhat it takes!
You only have one Pokémon ready for\nbattle? It's more fun with more friends!
Baseball and Pokémon battles\nare dramas that don't need scripts!\c
To be a great baseball player, you have\nto be able to hit, play defense, and run!
In the spirit of sportsmanship,\nI must say you'd be at a disadvantage\r\nin a two-against-one match!
A spot of greenery growing right next\nto a big city!\c\nTruly an oasis! I feel so refreshed...\nAnd now I'd like to battle!\c
Oh... It no longer feels like an\noasis if I lose!
I think the big boulders in this oasis can\nbe moved using the Strength hidden move!
City Pokémon or\nPokémon that live in the forest...\r\nWhich do you prefer?\c
I love both kinds of Pokémon,\nbut I don't like losing!
The best place for humans to live isn't\nnecessarily the best place for Pokémon.\c\nOf course, the best place for me to\nlive is in my bed!
This is called the battle train!\nAll aboard!\c
You're the nonstop express line! I'm the\nlocal line that stops at every station...
Did you try out the Battle Subway?\nIt's in Nimbasa City.\c\nThere are a lot of unique Trainers\nyou can battle. It's very exciting!
When I'm riding my Bicycle, don't\nyou think I look stronger?\c
The cool breeze in my face stopped!\nSo did my Bicycle!
Cycling is a sport, too!\nFollow the rules and ride safely!
Ting-a-ling-ling. ♪\nFull-speed attack, coming your way!\c
Ting-a-ling-ling. ♪\nTing.♪ Ting-a-ling-ling. ♪
When people are running by, you\ncan't help but stop and look at them.
Testing out one's theory is all\na part of science!\c
Analyzing the current situation\nis also a part of science!
Just because a previous method worked\nbefore, doesn't mean it will again!\c\nThe process of trial and error!\nIs that what science is all about?
I shall uncover the mechanism behind\nTrainer and Pokémon relationships!\c
Why are Pokémon able to understand\ntheir Trainer's orders?
I wonder if Professor Rowan of the Sinnoh\nregion has managed to unlock the mystery\r\nof how Pokémon evolve.
To me, the battlefield is a\nplace for learning!\c
W-wait!\nI've got to analyze this defeat!
By losing, you can discover\nwhat your true strength is! Heh!
I need to research the Exp. Points of\nPokémon for my homework assignment!\c
It's not fair to use moves\nI wasn't expecting!
Hmm! I see! If a high-level Pokémon\ndefeats a lower-level Pokémon, they\r\ndon't receive very many Exp. Points!
Pouring rain... ♪\nFighting Pokémon... ♪\c
Ah, hear the sad melody\nof a total defeat...
Rain, rain! I love rain! ♪\nIf I'm crying, I can hide my tears with\r\nmy parasol!
Water fun with Pokémon!\nDo you want to play with us?\c
My oh my...\nI lost!
I'll go home and get my boyfriend to...\nNo, I'll get my Pokémon to cheer me up!
Nature!\c
Naaatuuure!
If I use this, will my Pokémon\nalso become energetic?\c
When we are surrounded by green,\nwe feel more energetic. Don't you think?\r\nThank you, Mother Nature! I love you!
Well, well, well...\nIf it isn't a lost Pokémon!\c
Sorry! I mistook you for a Pokémon!
Everyone loves playing hide-and-seek...\nI have trouble finding them!
Teacher?\c\nOh, you're not Teacher!\nYou're a Trainer!\c
The tall grass is too...tall!
There's a weird Pokémon hiding in the\nrustling grass!
Roar!\c\nI'm a Pokémon!\c
Quit it!\c\nI'm not really a Pokémon!
I hide in the tall grass and pretend\nto be a Pokémon.\c\nI'm what you might call a\nmethod actress!
The two of us make an amazing\ncombination! Let's battle!\c
Sola: Our amazing combination\nhad no impact on you!\c\nAna: I can't believe it! We should\nhave been perfect, but we lost!
If my sister is full of energy,\nthen I'm full of energy, too!\c\nIt's kind of like we have the\nPokémon Ability called Synchronize!
Oh, you only have one Pokémon...\nIt would be more fun if you had more!
The teamwork of Twins...\nA true example of perfection!\c
Even though we look the same,\nour parents can always tell us apart!
Only one Pokémon?\nI can't believe it... How could you?
A battle on a raised walkway!\nThat's kind of cool.\c
Losing is uncool.\nNo, no, you are cool.
Stand still on a raised walkway, and\nyou'll lose your balance and fall!
I love raised walkways!\c\nBalancing is fun,\nso I often come here to play.\c
I lost,\nbut I won't stop!
If you walk on a raised walkway, you can\nmove without encountering wild Pokémon.
I'll be your opponent, but only\nif you have three or more Pokémon\r\nthat are ready for battle!
We go three against three in\nTriple Battles...\c\nAre you ready?\nI am! Let's go!\c
What?! I never even considered\nlosing before going into battle!
If you don't have many Pokémon with you,\nyou can't enjoy Triple Battles\r\nand it's easy to get into trouble!
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle\nthat uses three Pokémon.\c\nPlease prepare at least three Pokémon\nfor battle!
Round and round the rotation goes!\c\nCan you keep up without having your\nhead spin? Rotation Battle, begin!\c
Ohhh... My head is spinning!
To have so easily emerged victorious\nfrom a sudden Rotation Battle...\r\nYou are cool! Too cool, in fact!
The sounds of gently crashing waves...\nThe smell of salt in the air...\r\nAnd a battle with a Trainer\r\nin the prime of youth!\c
Simply excellent!\nThat's what being young is all about!
I feel rejuvenated whenever I get the\nchance to have a Pokémon battle with\r\nsomeone younger than myself.\c\nIt's like I'm taking in that\nperson's youthfulness!
Hello there, young Trainer.\nPlease, battle with me for a spell.\c
My oh my...\nToo bad. Looks like I lost.
When I was young, I traveled all\naround, together with my Pokémon.\c\nOh, I was such a tomboy! Ah ha ha!
Hoo!\nHa!\c
Gah!
...I lost! I'm sorry,\nmy precious Pokémon!
Number! Four! Teen!\c
OK!\nThank you very much!
Whether they win or lose, Pokémon can\nbecome just a little bit stronger after\r\neach and every battle.
Check out my lively Pokémon, which\nI've gathered from all around the\r\nUnova region!\c
Mmm hmm! Looks like you are\neven more lively and fresh!
As long as you've got momentum,\nyou don't need experience or knowledge!
Onward, my friends!\nMy Bug-type Pokémon swarm!\c
Pretty cool, huh?\nMy Bug-type Pokémon are the best!
It's not like I'm collecting them, but\nwhen I'm with lots of Bug-type Pokémon,\r\nmy lust for adventure is fulfilled!
Right now, I feel like\nmastering Triple Battles!\c\nIt sure would be great if you had three\nor more Pokémon ready for battle!
Let me test what fighting style\nis more effective!\c
By any chance, are you a\nTriple Battle genius?!
If you'd like, please have\nTriple Battles with your friends.
I'm trying to get better\nat Rotation Battles!\c\nI'll battle you if you have three or\nmore Pokémon ready for battle!
Let me test what fighting style\nis more effective!\c
What are you, some kind\nof Rotation Battle genius?
You should try having Rotation Battles\nwith your friends, too.
Kids! Please cooperate with this\npractice session for my Pokémon!\c
But my running play was supposed to\nbe so incredible that even Flying-type\r\nPokémon couldn't keep up...
Maybe this gift will be more\neffective than my running play!\c
Having a powerful and speedy\nrunning play is key to being a\r\ngood football player!
I-I...\nI'm not chubby, am I?\c
Big and strong!
Big and strong, I tell you!\c
I'm not putting myself down...\nBig and strong is what I'm saying!\r\nI'm not chubby! I'm just big and strong!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\ntraining for my Pokémon!\c
But my passing technique was supposed to\nbe so incredible that even Psychic-type\r\nPokémon couldn't predict it...
Maybe this gift will be more\neffective than my passing technique!\c
Football is a thinking person's sport!\nYou've got to outmaneuver and outwit\r\nyour opponent if you want to win!
I-I...\nI'm not plump, am I?\c
Gotta go huge!
I'm gonna go huge, I tell you!\c
I'm trying to bulk up so I can\nshrug off any opponent's tackle!\r\nI'm not getting plump!
I-I...\nI'm not all sweaty, am I?\c
Gotta have passion!
It's all about passion, I tell you!\c
I'm just really passionate about\nbattling! I'm not just some sweaty dude!
My undefeated Pokémon and I\nhave our eyes set on you for\r\nour practice opponent!\c
I knew I had the right person!
I'm practicing my gift-giving technique\nfor my fans! Here, take this!\c
I got some great practice\nfrom our battle!\c\nI'll become even stronger!
Training or not, I don't hold back!\c
Impressive!\nYou've got some spectacular skills!
This is a token of my appreciation!\nTake it with you!\c
If I practice against strong Pokémon\nthen I can get even stronger!
If you're persistent in your efforts,\nyou'll eventually get stronger!\r\nThat's why I love practicing!\c
I especially love practicing against you!
Take this as my thanks\nfor practicing with me!\c
The more you practice, the better\nyou'll be in an actual match!\c\nI hope you keep practicing, too!
My partner and I have been through a\nlot together! Here we go!\c
I won't let consecutive losses get me down!\nThat's my policy!
This is a token of my appreciation!\nTake it with you!\c
Don't let losses get you down, either!\nDo things your own way!
My right shoulder is itching to throw!\c\nLet's see if you can catch my super\nfastball, right down the center!\c
Not even my super fastball was enough!\nWell, at least I can say I gave it my all!
This is a token of my appreciation!\nTake it with you!\c
Thanks to you, I feel like I can\nbe proud of my fastball!\c\nThanks so much!
My style is to use powerful Pokémon\nto keep up a winning streak!\r\nI'll teach you a lesson!\c
...You taught me!\nYou're so powerful!
This is my thanks for teaching me!\c
I'll research some more battle styles\nso I can learn to use this power\r\nmore effectively!
When it comes to handling the ball, leave\nit to me! Same goes for Poké Balls!\c
Oh! I guess being a skilled ball handler\ndoesn't have much to do with battles!
Items are your friend!\nUse them with care!\c
I'm still just a beginner in the\nworld of Pokémon battling!
I gathered a bunch of cool Pokémon\nto make my team. I'll teach you a\r\nthing or two about their strength\r\nin this lecture!\c
Bam! You lectured me!\nYou are so cool!
This is my thanks for the lecture!\c
No matter how cool the Pokémon is, it's\nup to the Trainer to lead it to victory!
When it comes to keeping the ball, leave\nit to me! My dribbling skills are perfect!\c
Of course...dribbling a Poké Ball\nwon't do any good!
You've got to be technical with\nhow you use items!\c
Soccer balls and\nPoké Balls...
Hey, check this!\nTrap and...shoot!\c
Hmm... My Pokémon don't come out any\nstronger even if I give the ball momentum?
Items are important, both in sports\nand in Pokémon battles!\c
I'm going to come up with a separate\ntraining regimen for when I practice\r\nPokémon battles.
The amount you sweat is a good\nindicator of how youthful you are!\c
I don't care if I lose. I'm still young!\nThat was a good sweat!
When you start to sweat,\ntry using this item!\c
My capacity for exercise is one of\nmy better points!\c\nIt's all so I can get a good sweat!
Hey there!\c\nThink you can overcome\nmy tricky dribbling style?\c
Hey! Come on, watch me!\nI was dribbling this whole time!
I'm gonna pass this item to you\nwhile dribbling at the same time!\c
I love Pokémon battles,\nand I love basketball!\c\nI'm so lucky to be able to do both!
Young Trainer!\nAre you getting enough exercise?\c
After you're done exercising,\ndon't forget to rehydrate yourself!
Here, I'll give you this,\nso sweat with me!\c
People lose water from their bodies\nsimply by breathing!\c\nThat means that to sweat is to live!
Hey! Trainer!\c\nCheck out my long shot!\nI've got serious range!\c
No one can beat me when it comes to taking\na long shot, but I still have a lot to learn\r\nwhen it comes to Pokémon battles!
Short pass of an item\ncoming right at you!\c
There's always more to learn when it\ncomes to improving one's technique in\r\nboth Pokémon battles and basketball!
Hey there!\c\nWhat do you think of this ball?\nI polished it until it shined!\c
I may have lost the battle, but no one\ncan beat me when it comes to shining balls!
I polished this item until\nit shined, too!\c
Taking good care of your ball is\nimportant both in sports and in\r\nPokémon battles. Don't you think so?
My practice match is coming up!\c\nI will practice smashes\nby using you as a wall!\c
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\nThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\nLemme...catch...my breath...\c
You and I have just met!\nLet's start this game from the beginning.
Be in awe of my leg strength, which\nI developed through relentless rallies!\c
I suppose leg strength doesn't matter\nmuch in a Pokémon battle...
Take this item as a gift!\nBe in awe of it!\c
Train alongside a speedy Pokémon, and\nleg strength will come to you naturally!
The interclub match is coming soon.\c\nI will practice smashes\nby using you as a wall!\c
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\nThat was some good training...
Huh huh huh...\nLemme...catch...my breath...\c
You and I have just met!\nLet's start this game from the beginning.
No matter how fast the ball is moving,\nit doesn't escape my vision!\r\nNothing gets past me!\c
Your strength has been preserved\nin my mind's eye!
I hope you'll preserve this gift\nin your mind's eye!\c
Sometimes it's best to let the ball go\nby instead of hitting it back.\c\nIn tennis, you need to be able to\nmake quick decisions on the fly!
My pinpoint smash is as accurate as\nthreading a string through a needle!\r\nThink you can handle it?\c
You happily handle any kind of attack!\nWhat a big heart you have!
I'll show that I have a big heart, too!\nHere, have this item!\c
You need to put everything you've\ngot into each and every hit of the ball!\c\nTreat each moment of your life as if\nit's a match point!
I need to practice more as a\nPokémon Breeder.\r\nPlease, be my opponent!\c
I've still got a long way to go...\nI'll be raising my Pokémon!
Thank you so much!\c\nI learned a lot from our battle.\nBe my opponent again sometime!
I'm always patrolling this area!\c\nI'll show you a Pokémon battle that\ntakes advantage of the terrain!\c
Argh! I couldn't take advantage of\nthe terrain... What went wrong?!
A Ranger always has one of these.\nI'll give it to you!\c
The forest and the Pokémon\nthat live inside are alive...\c\nSomething changes every day,\nso it's fun to patrol!
We are totally in sync!\c\nUsing our amazing connection,\nI will teach you all about Rangers!\c
In fact, we learned\nall about you!
Do you know this Berry?\c
Listen carefully...\c\nYou may hear the sound\nof breathing Pokémon and plants.
Check out my Alomomola! It took\nme 100 Poké Balls to catch it!\c
I guess the number of Poké Balls I used to\ncatch my Pokémon doesn't mean much in\r\na battle...
There are other Alomomola, but I feel\nlike I was destined to be with this one!
Argh! It got away!\nI almost caught it, too!\r\nTimes like this call for a Pokémon battle!\c
Phew! I lost again, but it was nice\nto take my mind off fishing for a bit!
You've got to remain optimistic if\nyou want to be a good Fisherman!\r\nEven if your catch gets away,\r\nthere's no use crying about it!
I am a wonderful Fisherman\nwho loves everything!\c
I even love a disappointing result!
I want to go deep-sea fishing\nusing the Royal Unova\r\nthat leaves from Castelia City!
Hey! What kinds of great Pokémon\nhave you caught?\c
Ho ho!\nThese are some impressive Pokémon!
My own Pokémon are the best ones\nfor me! I won't compare them with\r\nanyone else's!
A woman standing alone with a parasol\nin one hand at the beach...\r\nHi... Please have a battle with me.\c
The parasol can block ultraviolet rays,\nbut it can't block moves...
I heard a parasol is a must\non the beach...\r\nBut I'm the only one who has one?
If you've got three or more Pokémon\nready for battle, let's have a\r\nRotation Battle!
Forming a team of three Pokémon that can\nwork well together is key in a\r\nRotation Battle! Let's begin!\c
Oh no! The way I positioned my\nPokémon was terrible!
In honor of your great teamwork,\nplease accept this Berry!\c
You really need to be able to\npredict your opponent's moves\r\nin a Rotation Battle! It's a true\r\ntest of a Trainer's skill!
If you've got three or more Pokémon\nready for battle, let's have a\r\nTriple Battle!
The power of three come together as one!\nLet's have a Triple Battle!\c
Everyone coming together as one...\nWhat great teamwork that was!
Your great display of teamwork impressed\nme, so I'd like to give you this!\c
In a Triple Battle, your Pokémon have\nmore than triple the power!\r\nIt's a true test of a Trainer's skill!
Behold my impressive physique.\nIt's fitting of an Ace Trainer!\c
My Pokémon couldn't do my\nimpressive physique justice!
You can do all sorts of crazy stuff as\nlong as you've got energy!
To battle in a high-up place...\c\nThis is the perfect situation for\nan Ace Trainer such as I!\c
To tell the truth...\nI'm actually afraid of heights...
Overcoming one's fears is an important\npart of being an Ace Trainer!\c\nBut still, I hate being up so high...
Rio and I are of one mind!\c\nThat's why you're going to have to\nuse two Pokémon against us!\c
Cleo: Wow, what a surprise!\nRio: Wow, what a surprise!
I've got to get stronger so\nI can take care of Rio!
You've only got one Pokémon with you?\nYou can't battle both of us like that!
It's so fun to battle alongside Cleo!\c
Being able to combine your strength\nwith a great friend in battle is a truly\r\namazing thing!
You only have one Pokémon\nthat's ready for battle?\c\nToo bad! Two-against-two Pokémon\nbattles are really fun, you know?
Travel the uneven road to hone yourself!\nYou've got to train your guts!\c
You can't win just with guts!\nThat's the truth of it...
You can't win just with guts, but that\ndoesn't mean you don't need them!\r\nIsn't that right, Heracross?
You gotta have stamina!\c\nBurn the flames of life,\nand never stop moving forward!\c
I'm out of stamina!
I was just joking about never stopping!\c\nYou need to take a break every once\nin a while to rest your mind and body!
I have a request for you!\nPlease battle me!\c
I'm mad that I lost, but I'm happy that\nmy Pokémon got some good experience!
Battling with you is a truly\nmeaningful experience!\r\nPlease be my opponent again sometime!
I'm proud of my Pokémon, which\nI raised with love and care!\c
Looks like I lost to you in the\nlove-and-care department... You're amazing!
If you don't raise your Pokémon with\nlove and care, they'll grow up to be\r\nsad Pokémon that don't want to battle!
My Pokémon and I spend so much time\ntogether, we don't need words\r\nto understand one another.\c\nDo you think you can win against us?\c
You can understand each other\nvery well, too!
When you see this Berry,\nplease remember us!\c
The best part about being a\nPokémon Ranger is that you get\r\nto spend time with Pokémon!
I trained my body and mind\nby standing under a waterfall!\r\nNothing will faze me now!\c
What...\nI mean, how?
I admit your strength\nand give you this gift!\c
Maybe I should train my body and mind\nby standing under a waterfall!\c\nI can get clean while I'm at it!
I travel the world because\nI'm looking for danger!\r\nAre you dangerous, Trainer?\c
You're so dangerous that I was in\ndanger of giving up the match!
Why do I seek out danger?\c\nBecause it's exciting, that's why!\nIt makes me feel alive!
I might be lost right now,\nbut I'll battle you anyway!\c
I don't stand a chance if I\nfight while I'm lost.
I still have no idea what this\nplace is like!\c\nI never carry a map with me!
Join our team!\c\nActually, I will force you\nto join our team!\c
Our team doesn't need a Trainer\nwho is quite that strong!
We hang out here every day!\nEvery day until the end of time!
If I win, give me your Pokémon!\c
That was just a joke.\nEveryone's taking it so seriously!
Hmph! I take weak Pokémon and raise\nthem with tender care until they're\r\ngood and strong! That's my policy!
Do you want to pass through here?\c\nThen, you must greet me!\c
You!!\nWhat great strength you have!
Chase the sun during the day,\nand sleep all night...\r\nThat might be a good life for me.
Heheh!\nNobody can beat my speed and fury!\c
I have lost!\nI am such a loser!
Ahh! Maybe I should just pick up\nmy bike and charge outta here!\r\nNo one would doubt how wild I am then!
Hey, hey, what have we here, boys?\c\nYou have good Pokémon.\nLet me see!\c
Jim: Ah, I get it!\nThat's what you call friendship, huh?\c\nCas: Huh? You're saying the friendship\nbetween us bad dudes isn't good enough?
There are good Pokémon,\nbut there are no bad Pokémon.\c\nEverything is up to the Trainer.\nThat's what I think!
You've got only one Pokémon?\nBut Single Battles are too boring!
Hey, hey! A bad one teamed up\nwith another bad one!\c\nDo you know what it means?\c\nThat means we are very bad!\c
Even bad men like us\ncan be friends!\c\nWhat a great thing!\nFriendship between men\r\nand friendship with Pokémon...
What? You've only got one\nPokémon that can fight?\c\nI cannot take a cheap shot,\nfighting two against one!
Our sweat and tears go into this Gym...
And to think of all the walls we've broken\ndown up until now... To hit a wall like this...
The distance between winning and coming\nclose to winning is so close, yet so far!
Everything went dark all of a sudden!
Looks like the conveyor brought\nin a strong Trainer like you!
I might have lost, but I'm going\nto continue to believe in my Pokémon!
You didn't notice the pitfall at\nmy feet while we were battling?!
Hey there, young Trainer!\c\nIf you're unsure about something,\nI'll happily act as your opponent!\c
Excellent!\nThis was a defeat I can't disagree with!
I'm ashamed to admit it, but\nI'm actually lost right now...\c\nNow, which way did I come from again?
If you have the move Dive,\nyou can dive and sink!\c
Blub, blub, blub...\n...I am sinking.
Have your Pokémon\nlearned the move Dive?\c\nDive is good! Great!\n'Cause it's Dive!
I've been challenging the Pokémon Gyms\nall across the world!\c
I couldn't defeat them all, but I learned\na lot at the Gyms and became stronger!
It's fine! I just want to have fun\nwith Pokémon battles!\c\nPeople who want nothing but to win should\nkeep trying until they are satisfied.
We spend our lives swimming!\nOf course we battle while swimming, too!\c
I lost. But I'm still cool, because not many\npeople can say they battled while swimming!
My Pokémon and I saw it\nwith our own eyes!\c\nI'm talking about the ancient ruins at\nthe bottom of the sea near Undella Town!
Seeing a Pokémon use its best moves\nagainst another Pokémon\r\nis really an adventure!\c
The adventure is over already.
It appears that my vacation\nshall never end.\c\nI wonder if that's OK...
Time for an aquatic battle in\nthe sea near Undella Town!\c
I'm going to just float on by...
Sometimes Jellyfish Pokémon are\nfloating in the water around here!
I'm showing off the sea\nto my beloved Pokémon...\c
Wow!\nHow powerful!
I want to see all kinds of scenery!\c\nYou can only truly have hope for\ntomorrow when you learn how big\r\nthe world is and how small you are!
You see this enormous puddle?\nThey call it an ocean!\c
Whoa!\nYou're enormous, too!
Big things are awesome! Why?\nBecause they're big!
I trained with Marlon,\nthe Gym Leader of Humilau City!\c
I still have room to improve!\nThanks for teaching me a lesson!
They say that Marlon, the Gym Leader\nof Humilau City, can stay in the ocean\r\nfor seven days and seven nights!
What?! You're a Trainer?\nAwesome! Come on, my Remoraid!\c
Oh well... Time for my Remoraid to\nreturn to their Poké Balls...
Pokémon just wait inside their\nPoké Balls until they are needed...\c\nPokémon sure are convenient\nfor us humans.
Catch this! My Pokémon is huge!\c
Wow! Impressive Pokémon!\nEven more so than I expected!
Wailord is over 47 feet long,\nbut it still fits inside a Poké Ball!\r\nThe power of science sure is incredible!
I'll have a battle with you using\nmy freshly caught Pokémon!\c
I had no idea how my Pokémon would fight.\nI mean, I caught them just a moment ago!
I may have just caught them, but\nI'll raise them to be strong!\c\nOur time together has just begun!
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!\c\nI'm practicing my punching technique\nin front of the sea! Give it a try!\c
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!\nI won't stop punching just because I lost!
I'm training to not be fooled by\nthe swimming ladies...\c\nI'm not just looking at them!
It takes a lot of strength to\nswim in the ocean.\r\nAre your Pokémon OK?\c
I see!\nWhat energetic Pokémon!
OK! I'll replenish your\nPokémon's energy!\c
Everything's OK now!\nCome back anytime!
Welcome! Do you have\na reservation for a battle?\c
Oh my!\nIt appears you reserved a victory, too!
You are great!\nI want to hire you.
I just keep running around!\nI've got the whole field to myself!\c
I know... I know...\nI shouldn't take it all for myself.
I ran around a ton and got the\nHeavy Walker Medal!
A high-level battling technique\nis art in its own way!\c
Your strength cannot be\nput into words!
I'll draw how I want to draw!\nI'll live how I want to live!\r\nThat's the best way!
We've just got to do what we can!\c
I feel like I understood what I could\ndo and what I couldn't.
I'll try to increase the things I can\ndo and challenge you again!
Shut up and battle with me!\c
...!
You're strong!
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.
You can learn all sorts of things from\na long day spent fishing.\c
No matter what the outcome of a battle,\nyour Pokémon will never leave your side.
Thinking that people and Pokémon will\nrespect you if you're strong is\r\njust a bunch of baloney, really.\c\nThe moment you lose, all those people\nwho were cheering for you will disappear.
How do you like riding on leaves?\c\nIf you manage to beat me, I'll teach\nyou something good. You'll see!\c
I lost? Now I just want to climb aboard\na leaf and be swept away somewhere...
When two leaves collide, the leaf that\nwas moving is stopped and the leaf\r\nthat was struck begins moving...
To be as clear as water...\nThat is the style that I seek!\c
When I lose, I feel as if I\nmight just disappear...
I may have been the one to lose, but\nI'm still going to go ahead and say it...\c\nYou should definitely seek a style,\nbut everyone has his or her own style!
Oh! To think that you would deliberately\nseek me out for a battle!\c\nI'm so tickled that I won't hold\nanything back as a reward!\c
What oppressive force...\nWhat a Trainer!
Losing will only make me stronger.\c\nI will use this frustration as a\nstepping-stone to rise again!\r\nFor that I thank you.
It is said that water will not grow\nstagnant as long as it keeps flowing...\r\nSo as long as I keep moving onward...\c
I won't give up, even if I am defeated!\nThat toughness is the pride of an\r\nAce Trainer!
When riding leaves, the direction they\nfloat in will depend on which side you\r\ngot on from.\c\nDon't worry! If you keep trying, you'll\nfind our Leader sooner or later!
When I win, and even when the impossible\nhappens and I lose, I analyze every one\r\nof my battles to grow stronger.\c\nDo you really think you can beat\nsomeone like me?\c
I want to ride away on my Pokémon\nso that I might ponder why I lost...
Riding on a beloved Pokémon and thinking\nabout things is so nice that you'll find\r\nyou come up with all kinds of good ideas.
The thing about water is that it's\nalways changing...\c\nFrom the piercing strength of a jet,\nto the crushing power of a wave...\r\nThat's what I'm about to show you!\c
What strength...\c\nYou're just as strong as Marlon...or\nperhaps even stronger...?!
You know... Each Trainer has different\nPokémon, and Pokémon all have their\r\nown strengths.\c\nI've got to learn more about the\nstrengths of my own Pokémon!
Ugh! I'm getting really\nsick of losing over here!
This Pokémon I stole...\nIt's no help at all!
Ah... I see...\nThat was quite well thought out.
Splendid!\nYou are quite the Trainer!
Don't let it go to your head...\nBut you put up a good fight, kid!
What's the big idea? This Pokémon\nI stole is useless!
Bravo!!\c\nWhat you showed us is\nthe spark of Trainers.\c\nHowever, let me say just one thing.\c\nPlease move on to an even greater goal.\c
I am Emmet.\c\nI lost together with Ingo.\c\nYour combination is\nthe best. Perfect!\r\nYou're verrrrry strong Trainers.\c
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.
Ho! You fight as if you really understand\nyour Pokémon!
You! So you're a Trainer who fights\nwhile believing in your Pokémon, are you?
Plasmaaaa!\nPlasmaaaa!!
The Gym Leader is tough, but you...\nAre you even human?!
I tried to use the same combination as\nyou, and yet...
No! At this rate, I... I won't be\nable to protect the Plasma Frigate!
P-P-P-Plasmaaaa!
Let's do it, partner!
I'm counting on you!
I couldn't even draw out my team's\nreal strength... How pathetic!
Let's do it, partner!
I'm counting on you!
I couldn't even draw out my team's\nreal strength... How pathetic!
Let's do it, partner!
I'm counting on you!
I couldn't even draw out my team's\nreal strength... How pathetic!
The fierce energy I feel from you...\nIt is just like that of a soaring dragon!
Such energy on the offense...\nYou are truly without equal!
The three Pokémon you picked...\nThey gave me a run for my money!
Such defense...\nIt is beyond comparison!
The Pokémon you picked...\nThey supported each other well.
Those footsteps I have heard drawing\nnear... I have been waiting for you!\c
I knew as soon as I heard your footfalls\nthat you were a force to be reckoned with!
I had actually been meaning to\ngive you something.\c
I was imagining how a Burmy must feel\nwrapped in a cloak of fallen leaves!
Keep going with the momentum!\nReady, set...fight!\c
What's with this still calm?\nI couldn't win with just momentum?
I found some Berries among the fallen\nleaves, so... Here.\c
I wanted to know how Pokémon must feel\nwhen they bury themselves underground,\r\nso I buried myself, too!
Surprised? That's when I'll make my move!\c
Just as I'd expect!\nYou're ready for anything, aren't you?
If you are prepared,\nyou don't have to worry!\c
I burrowed under the fallen leaves\nto become one with nature!
I'll show you the Ranger spirit that\nburns with a crimson flame!\c
Oh! I see your Trainer spirit also burns\nwith a crimson flame!
I'll offer you this in recognition of\nyour spirit.\c
My red costume really goes with the\nleaves over here!
What's this? A visitor? Ooh, I'm so happy\nto meet someone else here!\c\nCould I ask you to be my opponent in a\nlong-awaited Pokémon battle?\c
It's all well and good fighting wild Pokémon,\nbut there is a certain thrill to be found in\r\nbattling against another Trainer!
This house... Doesn't it seem like the\nfurniture just moves itself?\c\nNo! It's not me! I'm seriously not\nmoving it!
You... Who are you?\c\nThere is another person here besides me?\nWe don't need any Trainers here!\c
So you are a normal person...\nA normal ⒆⒇ Trainer...
This house...\nIt brims with fear, sorrow, defeat...\c\nSo many feelings fill these walls, giving\nrise to a mysterious energy.
Feel this boiling spirit!\nMy Patrat is gonna amaze you!\c
Oh, this wilting spirit...\nIt wasn't supposed to end this way...
This indomitable spirit!\nI won't be brought down by losing!\r\nMoving forward is all that matters!
A Triple Battle is a special battle you\ncan hold using three Pokémon!
Behold the strength I have perfected\nthrough Triple Battle!\c
How could this be...\nI thought I'd perfected it...
If you want to be the best, you need to\nknow the best moves and tricks for\r\nTriple Battles!
In a Rotation Battle, you will battle\nusing three Pokémon!
It's a Rotation Battle!\nWill you go right? Will you go left?\c
Is it just a lack of experience that makes\nme unsure which way to rotate?
You have to make up for your lack of\nexperience with intellect and reasoning.\c\nIf you don't, you will never be able to\nwin against more experienced Trainers.
I feel invincible because I am surrounded\nby the smiles of children and Pokémon!\c
Wow! Great, great!\nYou are very strong!
Speak while making eye contact, and\nexpress your feelings to each other...\r\nIt's the same for people and Pokémon.
Hey! Trainer!\nHave a battle with me!\c
Oops. I have no healthy Pokémon\nleft to fight...
Argh! You went all out against a kid!\n...Actually, that's a good thing. Thanks!
Take this!\nHyper Beam!\c
Whoops...
A Hyper Beam? Hmm...no.\nMaybe I want to do a Giga Impact now?
Trainer!\nI wanna play with you.\c
Trainer!\nYou too strong!
Guess what! Guess what! When I grow up,\nI'm gonna ride on Reshiram or Zekrom!
When it comes to fishing, I'll do anything\nand go anywhere to learn more!\c\nThat's why I'll be asking you for\nthis battle!\c
You and your Pokémon make a pretty strong\nteam, huh?
That's right! I'd check behind every sign\nin the city if it was for fishing!
If I don't live with my Pokémon, a\nFisherman like me won't be able to fish.\r\nI won't be able to battle either!\c
Right now I just feel like we're so lucky to\nhave Pokémon!
Team Plasma...\c\nThey reminded me how important the\ntime is that I have with my Pokémon.\r\nI'd almost begun to take it for granted.
A Trainer catches another Trainer's eye.\nThat is the start of a Pokémon battle!\c
What?!\nYou are too strong!
And I've done nothing but train my\nPokémon ever since I lost to that\r\nTrainer from Nuvema Town two years ago!
Now dance gracefully!\nBring forth your beautiful moves!\r\nLet us perform, my lovely Pokémon!\c
Even though they lost,\nmy Pokémon are still cute!
I'll make my cute Pokémon even stronger\nby having battles with lots of Trainers!
I've asked myself if it really is natural\nfor Pokémon to live with people.\c\nI still haven't come up with an answer.\c\nBut we can still battle together!\c
All sorts of feelings are stirred up\nby battling.
Lose...and then accept all of the sorrow\nand frustration that comes with the loss.\c\nThat's what it means to be a Trainer--\nwhat it means to live with Pokémon.
Two years ago I parted ways with\nmy Pokémon...\c\nYet in my heart, I've never stopped being\na Pokémon Trainer!\c
This is the type of defeat that only a\nPokémon Trainer can experience!
Those lives that come into our world\nas Pokémon...\c\nFor me, being unsure if they really\nwanted to live with humans, I parted\r\nways with my Pokémon.\c\nBut as it turns out, the time we spent\ntogether seems to be the best of all.
Beedrill! Volbeat!\nGo, my beastly Bug-type Pokémon!\c
Your Pokémon uses those kinds of moves?!
Different Trainers use\ndifferent kinds of Pokémon!\r\nThat's fun to see, isn't it?
I always lose...\c\nBut I just want to see my Pokémon use\ntheir moves and do their best!\c
Phew...\nYour Pokémon... That was amazing!
I always lose...\c\nBut after battling so many times, I seem\nto have become a little stronger!
Backpackers are exactly what they\nsound like.\c\nThey set out on the road with only\nthe packs on their backs and the Pokémon\r\nin their Poké Balls!\c
I wish I could pack some wins in my\nbackpack, too...
The purpose of the journey is found in\nthose that I meet!\c\nIsn't it great to encounter all the\ndifferent Pokémon there are in the world?
Hm? You're headed for the Juniper\nPokémon Lab, are you?\c\nWon't you have a bit of fun first?\c
You were not an opponent one could\ndefeat without trying!
I came all the way here wanting to hear\nProfessor Juniper talk!\c\nShe was also a Backpacker once, so I bet\nwe'd have a great time swapping tales!
I am not running now,\nbut I usually barrel through\r\nas quickly as I can!\c
I have not crossed\nthe finish line of victory!
I'm going to use this little rest\nto give you this present!\c
Run and run in cities\nand on mountain paths!\c\nRun, and feel the world around you\nwith your whole being!
I choose a move, and\nmy Pokémon will do the move.\c\nIn a moment, that move will\nreach your Pokémon!\c
I lost, but during the battle,\nwe were connected. Right?
This Berry may connect\nyou and your Pokémon.\c
From today to tomorrow...\npeople, Pokémon, and the world...\c\nThey're all connected, you know?
I wanna be like the Trainers on Route 1!\c
S-so...this is Route 1!
Pop quiz! What's so good about Route 1?\c\nEverything! It's number one, after all!\nGet it?
Pokémon and people...\nAnd now you and I...\c
Pokémon and people...\nThat's what this world is made up of.
A world without Pokémon?\nI can't even imagine such a thing!
Fishermen read the flow of water\nor the flow of a battle!\c
The flow of the battle...\nIt's too wild to follow!
The flow of water here on Route 17\nis very wild.\c\nIf you don't tap into it well,\nyou cannot go where you want!
If I just dangle this fishing line here, it\nlooks like I'm doing something, right?\c\nTruth is, I'm not doing a single thing!\c
I got caught up in it...\nCaught by my own bait...
In fishing, you'll have good days and\nyou'll have bad days.\c\nBut hey, losing is the mother of\nall invention!
I am good at backstroke,\nfreestyle, butterfly...\r\nAnd, of course, Pokémon battles!\c
Did I just lose a Pokémon battle,\neven though I'm so good at them??
Shall I practice my swimming?\nOr shall I train my Pokémon?\c\nHmmmm, it's hard to decide,\nso I will swim with my Pokémon!
Grrrmmm... All I do lately is grumble...\c
Mrrr... Mmmrrr...\nShould I try to mumble “I lost"?
I wonder what is left after all my\ngrumbling and mumbling?
I learned all the good points of my\nClamperl and Shellder by swimming\r\nwith Pokémon!\c
What a fresh Trainer!\nReally fresh, fresh!
I'm a girl with everything...\c\nWell, everything but a place to\nput my Poké Balls!
I was taking a little break, but hey,\nI always have time for Pokémon battles!\r\nLet's enjoy it as much as possible!\c
Wooosh!\nSsshhhh!!
I'll tell you why I was taking a break.\c\nI have trouble with my bikini.\nIt could be washed away...
When I look down from a high place,\nI feel very good!\c\nPokémon battles are the same!\nI will fight looking down from the heights!\c
You're great!\nI can't help but look up to you!
We climb mountains because,\nno matter how hard it is,\r\nthe higher we climb,\r\nthe closer we get to the sky!
Down in a valley...\nyou and I face each other...\c
If you were the challenger, I'm sure even\nTeam Plasma would fall before you!
Even if Team Plasma had succeeded in\nreleasing all of the Pokémon...\c\nI'm sure that people would have just\nfound other ways to fight.
I would love it if you would join me in\na Rotation Battle.
Your Pokémon and your strategy!\nI'll be taking notes on both!\c
Now that I am a Veteran, I find there is\nso much more to learn...
Stronger Pokémon than anyone else...\nAn unbeatable strategy...\c\nThere are no such certitudes in Pokémon\nbattle...and that is why it is so deep!
I come to bear upon you now like a dragon\nfrom above...!\c
Salamence... Even in defeat, you are the\nmost noble of Pokémon.
A lone island in a distant sea...\nA steep and treacherous ravine...\c\nYes, this is what the noble and powerful\nDragon-type Pokémon is like.
What's this? You don't seem to have\nthree healthy Pokémon.
I may have been a Trainer for a very long\ntime, but I haven't gotten rusty!\c
I couldn't battle the way I pictured it in\nmy head...
My skills may not be rusty, but it seems\nmy spirit might not be up to snuff...\r\nGetting too used to things is frightening.
Oh no, I won't let a precious training\npartner get away that easily!\c
A battle against a Trainer really is the\nbest training!
Looking for training partners over here!\c\nI wouldn't say no to a girlfriend, either!
Fights have their own rhythms!\c\nI wonder whose Pokémon\ncan fight rhythmically.\c
Your Pokémon!\nTheir movements are right on the beat!
If my rhythm and the Pokémon's rhythm\nare in sync, then I'm plenty happy!
Ahhh! I've got my precious Litwick, so how\ncould I possibly lose?
Target acquired!\nTermination will now begin!\c
I was terminated...?\nWhat a Trainer!
We in Team Plasma are trying to keep all\nthe world's Pokémon for ourselves!\c\nIf we succeed in doing that, then world\ndomination wouldn't be a stretch!
Our king is gone...\nBut we are still here!\c
...Ugh.\nSeasickness is the worst...
We changed our uniforms so if the king\ncame back, he would know without\r\na doubt that he didn't belong here!\r\nThat traitorous little punk!
How about we see how well I can use this\nPokémon I got!\c
Plasmaaaa!\n...Hmph! No good, huh?
They said that if I joined Team Plasma, I\ncould get powerful Pokémon and do\r\nwhatever I liked!\c\nBut this Pokémon I got...\nIt's useless!
Aren't you pretty confident, waltzing\nright into the enemy's stronghold!\c
Argh! No wonder you're so confident with\nthat kind of strength!
Those idealistic fools who thought they\nwere saving Pokémon are all gone.\c\nAll of us left here are real thugs\nwanting to take over the world!
Hi there! I'm a Pokémon thief by trade!\c
Hmph!\nI missed my chance to grab your Pokémon!
I will continue poaching Pokémon! I've\ngot to be at least a little stronger!
...I trained myself endlessly for two\nyears to get justice for Team Plasma!\c\nI won't lose to anyone anymore!\c
...But if I lose, I won't be able to carry\nout my justice!
My plan for justice!\c\nI will carry it out no matter what anyone\nsays! No matter what!\c\nNot that you'd know anything about that!
The fighting furies:\nwe are Team Plasma!\c
What's a strong Trainer, huh?\nJust someone who uses their Pokémon?!
Strong Trainers don't care anything\nabout their Pokémon!\c\nThey're just bullies who force them to\nget stronger no matter how hard it is!
I will use Team Plasma's science to bring\nout my Pokémon's greatest power!\c
Why are you strong? You're just a normal\nperson...not even that! You're just a kid!
We in Team Plasma force our Pokémon to\nuse their powers to the max!\c\nRelease Pokémon? Why would we do\nsomething so bothersome as that?
Pokémon Trainers are nothing more than\nrestraints on the legs of their Pokémon!\c
What?! You can actually draw out the power\nof your Pokémon?!
...If Pokémon stay with Trainers, they'll\nbe soft and won't ever be able to draw\r\non their true power.\c\n...Do you think that is true?
Everyone who isn't in Team Plasma is\nan enemy!\c
...I hate you!
I hate the world! I don't need a world\nthat doesn't recognize me!\c\nThat's why I'll mess with you all as a\nmember of Team Plasma!
Intruder sighted!\c\nI'll have you know that the Pokémon I'm\nabout to use was stolen from a child!\c
...What a weak Pokémon.\nI'll just have to go steal some better ones!
If we steal Pokémon, the number of\nTrainers in the world will go down.\r\nThen we won't have any more enemies!
In my own way, I'm a strong part of this\nTeam Plasma group!\r\nPeople call me the Bisharp woman!\c
Great plans are\nalways interrupted.
You getting in our way means that you\nfind us worth the time, doesn't it?\c\n...Being ignored would make us feel\nawfully lonely.\c\nEr, no, I mean even if you get in the\nway, we'll take over the world this time!
Even if we don't have our hero anymore,\nwe still won't lose!\c
Plasmaaaa!\nGlory to Team Plasma!
Maybe if Team Plasma can take over the\nUnova region, our king will come back...
I won't tolerate people\nwho have different ideas!\c
Argh...\nI won't forgive you!
I repeat! We won't tolerate people\nwho have different ideas!\c\nIf Team Plasma takes over the world,\nthen everyone will think the same way!
It's not just our outfits that have\nchanged around here!\c\nWe're not living for the Pokémon anymore,\nbut for ourselves!\c
Whyyyy...?
Our king abandoned us...\c\nWe couldn't survive unless we changed\nthe way we thought...
Target acquired!\nTermination will now begin!\c
I was terminated...?\nWhat a Trainer!
We in Team Plasma are trying to keep all\nthe world's Pokémon for ourselves!\c\nIf we succeed in doing that, then world\ndomination wouldn't be a stretch!
Our king is gone...\nBut we are still here!\c

Whyyyy...?
Our king abandoned us...\c\nWe couldn't survive unless we changed\nthe way we thought...
Where do you think unfulfilled dreams go...?
That's right... We can't force Pokémon to\nbattle out of hatred...
What... Can it be that love is even stronger\nthan hatred?
Why? How could this be?\nHow could you try hard for someone else?!
Cleaning actually takes a lot\nof strength...\c\nIn other words, I've been training real\nhard by doing all this cleaning!\c
Oops! Who cares about winning or losing!\nThat spot over there is what's on my mind!
When you clean, do you ever feel like\nit's never going to end?\c\nWorks for me! That means I can clean\nforever, and I sure love cleaning.
Hey! Trainer!\nI'm cleaning here, so out of the way!\c
Why, I'll be!
As long as folks live, they make messes.\nAs soon as they do, I clean 'em up!
Sine, cosine, tangent!\c
Hmm. A tautology.
What a catastrophic theorem!
I'm a researcher studying about the\nsmell here!\c
If I were to express this disappointment in\nscent, I'd put it on par with a Gloom.
Even odors that might seem awful to\nhumans might be perfume to a Pokémon.
Whooooa!!\c
I loooost!!
Isn't it fun how shouting out in a sewer\nor a tunnel makes your voice echo?
Humans need sewers, but what\nabout Pokémon?\c\nTake that question, and take this battle\nchallenge with it!\c
There appears to be no barrier between you\nand your Pokémon!
Since we built this sewer, all kinds of\nPokémon have gathered here.\c\nIt's like there's no boundary between\nPokémon and people, right?
Yahoooo!\nIf you call, I'll come right away!\c
I'm on fire, baby! On fire!
Riding a Bicycle is fine, but I want\nto ride away on a Pokémon!
Shift gears and Bob's your uncle!\nYou'll be going full speed in no time!\c
No matter how I shift gears, it looks like\nI'll never be able to match your speed!
Whee! Mountain biking is tough--but\nthat's why it's so fun!
The path of karate is the path of\nhumanity...and the path of Pokémon!\c
Oof! It is not by chance that you have won!
Winners win because they deserve to win!
I, Black Belt Rich, will never turn my\nback and run!\c
...Ugh!\nSometimes you must retreat to win!
I will reexamine my own weaknesses.\c\nAt times I may hate myself for doing so,\nbut I cannot run from myself!
Greetings!\nSo...shall we do this?\c
What an upset!
Hmm... I just can't act naturally when I\nfocus on winning!
My training will never betray me. After\ntraining this much, I am certain to win!\c
...How can that be?\nEven after I trained so much!
Defeat leads to enlightenment.\nI realize now my own deficiency...\c\nBut I will not make excuses! I will use\nthis knowledge as fuel for tomorrow!
Hey, hey, hey!\nIt's all because of havin' love for\r\nPokémon, right?\c\nYeah, you know what I mean.\nCome on! I'm gonna have you battle!\c
Man, your love for your Pokémon hit me\nlike a ton of bricks!
Wouldn't it be nice to give your Pokémon\na little something?\c
Pokémon are always standing by their\nTrainers, right?\r\nYou have no idea how lucky we are!
I hold no grudge, whether I win or lose.\c\nThe point of battle is to train\nmy Pokémon, after all.\c
...Awww!\nBut I really wanted to win!
Gimme a Berry, gimme a Berry!\nGimme a Persim Berry!\c
My Pokémon really go into a funk when\nwe don't win, though.
Oh! A person!\nI haven't met another person in so long!\c\nYou're a Trainer, aren't you?!\nThen let's battle!\c
Huh? Maybe my instincts have grown dull\nafter so long...?
The roads around here are really very\ncomplicated, so hardly anyone ever comes\r\nthis way.
I've been waiting for this!\nWaiting for this very moment!\c
I had been waiting for such a strong Trainer\nas yourself!
I've been waiting for this!\nWaiting to give a gift to someone!\c
I've been lying in wait for ages beside a\nhidden item.\c\nAn Amoonguss couldn't have pulled off a\nbetter ambush...right?
O Trainer, embarking on the path to\nVictory Road!\c\nWon't you show me your true power?!\c
You didn't have to show me quite that\nmuch power...
If you have that much power, though, I'm\nsure that you can use one of these!\c
If you climb the stairs, you'll reach the\nBadge Check Gates...\r\nVictory Road lies right before you.
An Ace Trainer like me has pride,\nso I won't lose!\c
I could not protect my pride.\nI'm mortified!
Pride does not mean acting arrogantly!\c\nI'm really proud of what\nI have achieved in my life!
Challenging the Pokémon League, huh?\c\nIt's no wonder you might feel a bit\nnervous, but you've just got to believe\r\nin your Pokémon and do it!\c
Am I really going to be all right with only\nthis trifling power...?
When you feel uneasy or afraid, just hug\nyour Pokémon real tight!\c\nIf you do that, you'll be fine.\nIt'll just melt away all of your worries!
Cute Pokémon or tough Pokémon...\c\nWhich kind do you go for?\c
See, I like the cutely tough ones!
Most people think that Rock- and Steel-\ntype Pokémon are all tough looking.\c\nBut there are some cute little round\nones as well, you see!
The tunnel to Twist Mountain is complete!\nI heard that and came running!\c
I never heard that there were Trainers\nthis strong, though...
Apparently the soil here in this tunnel is\nquite like that in the ruins in Hoenn...
Ex! Ca! Vate!\c
Jack! Ham! Merrrr!
Excavate! Jackhammer!\nThey're manly sounding words, right!
We dig and we dig until we break through!\nWhat could be waiting on the other side?\c
You broke through!
Sweat dripping, chips flying,\ncrushing through rock and stone!\r\nThis is when I really feel alive!
Even after we finish constructing this\ntunnel, my Drill Pokémon won't ever stop!\r\nThey can't be stopped!\c
You stopped my Drill Pokémon?!
Watch our Pokémon's dynamic forms as\nthey crush through the bedrock!\c\nI can't imagine ever building another\ntunnel without the help of Pokémon!
Chili: Augh! You got me!\nYou and your Pokémon are on fire!
Cress: Lose? Me?\nI don't believe this!
Cilan: ...Huh.\nLooks like my timing was, um, off?
I get it! Ohhh, I really get it!\nBut then... So that's how it is!
I get it! So a Pokémon's strength really has\na lot to do with its Trainer, doesn't it?
The research that I spent my whole life on\nwas all for naught?!
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what is this?!\nP-P-P-P-P-P-Plasmaaaa!
The longer you live, the more opportunities\nfor failure.
It is the same for anyone...\nAs long as you are dreaming, the dream\r\nwill never reveal itself to you.
It doesn't bother us a bit if\nthe stolen Pokémon cry or beg.
It doesn't bother us a bit if Pokémon\nwin or lose.
It doesn't bother us a bit if we have to\nuse another Pokémon after one is defeated.
You may not find treasure by digging, but\nyou've still made a new road in the end.\c\nAugh, you caught me saying something\nmushy! Battle will hide my shame!\c
Phew...\nThat was enough for me to overlook it.
I've been thinking... If we dig too much,\nwill the whole Unova region collapse?
Keep on digging! We'll keep digging until\nwe reach the underworld!\c\nHey, you! If I beat you in battle, you've\ngot to help with the digging!\c
Urk!\nYou don't pull your punches!
If we keep expanding down here, Clay\nwill literally be an underground boss!
We step now into a new world...\nWhat kind of dangers await?\c\nWill you be able to make it through?\c
Well, shoot!\nKeep going then!
You, who have the strength to move on...\nTake these with you.\c
I wonder if order is being preserved\nbetween Pokémon and humans.
You will keep moving forward to wherever\nyour curiosity leads, won't you?\c
You've got an inexhaustible supply of\ncuriosity, haven't you!
To curiosity without end!\nHere's your reward. Wonderful.\c
Surprise! Excitement! Awe!\c\nCan you even imagine what must be waiting\nfor you up ahead?
Just being here fills me\nwith magical power...\c
You seem to be\nfull of magical power, too...
In ancient places, magical\nenergy remains...\c\nI can understand it.\nSo much sorrow and joy...
My Psychic-type Pokémon\njust started making noises.\c\nIs that because we're in the ruins...\nor is it because of you?\c
So...strong!\nWho are you?!
Relic Castle...\c\nApparently people and Pokémon came\ntogether here to create Unova.
...When I am here, I feel like I might\nbe crushed by sorrow.\c\nYou there...\nLet us have a bout!\c
This bout...\nI will not forget it...
This castle will be buried by the sands\nand forgotten in time...\c\nWhenever that sad fact strikes me, tears\nnaturally course down my face...
I'll knock you down with mountain power!\c
Your power is off the charts!
As great as a mountain... That's right!\nI'll become a mountain man!\c\nOh, wait, I suppose I already am!
Whooo!\nMoun-TAAAIIIN!\c
Let the scales fall from your eyes!
Mountains are sacred places.\nI am here to purify my heart and mind.
If you had three Pokémon, then we could\ndo a Rotation Battle!
I will read your mind and predict your\nevery move!\c
Your moves...\nThey are entirely unpredictable!
I am a Trainer who fights as freely as the\nclouds drift in the sky!\r\nDo not stiffen up on me!
A Triple Battle is a three-against-three\nPokémon battle!
Heh heh! I wonder what would happen if I\nhad all three Pokémon attack at once?\c
I couldn't pick a target to focus on...\nOr, rather, you never let me pick one!
A flood of attacks from three Pokémon...\c\nI know! “Jetstream" attack!\nLet's call it that.
Hold on. You there...\nAre you looking for the Magma Stone?\c
How about I tell you everything I know\nabout the Magma Stone?
Well, there's this Magma Stone in\nStark Mountain, yeah?\c\nYou move that, yeah? Then if you put\nit back where it belongs, they say the\r\nlegendary Pokémon Heatran will appear.
You see those pointy stones you find\nhere and there? Are you aware of them?\c
That marvelous power of yours...\nI was not aware of it!
Droplets of water containing lime keep\ndripping down for hundreds of years...\r\nThen they harden into stone cones.\r\nThose are what we call stalagmites!
I can feel the energy that overflows\nfrom the earth!\c
I felt the energy that overflowed\nfrom your Pokémon!
Take this!\nEarth's energyyyy!\c
Geothermal heat and abundant minerals...\nYes, volcanoes hold the planet's energy!
Battle in a volcano!\c
You're super strong!
Here! For you!\c
Volcanoes are called “kazan"\nin my language!
Hold on. You there...\nAre you looking for the Magma Stone?\c
How about I tell you everything I know\nabout the Magma Stone?
Well, there's this Magma Stone in\nStark Mountain, yeah?\c\nYou move that, yeah? Then if you put\nit back where it belongs, they say the\r\nlegendary Pokémon Heatran will appear.
I can feel the energy that overflows\nfrom the earth!\c
I really felt the energy that overflowed\nfrom your Pokémon!
Take this!\nEarth's energyyyy!\c
Geothermal heat and abundant minerals...\nYes, volcanoes hold the planet's energy!
Battle in a volcano!\c
You're super strong!
Here! For you!\c
Volcanoes are called “kazan"\nin my language!
How is magma created?\nCan you answer that?!\c
That power! That pressure!\nThat is the answer!
So strong pressure deep underground\nliquefies stone and turns it into magma...
When I am surrounded by rocks,\nmy spirit goes up!!\c
When I lose,\nmy spirits sink...
My spirits rise and fall.\nI'm just charmingly unpredictable!
Why do I dig?\nWhy do you fight?\c
Your past experience...\nIs that the source of your strength?
The more you fight,\nthe stronger you'll be.\c\nThe more you dig,\nthe bigger the hole will be...\c\nIf you have a purpose,\nthere's no wasted effort!
I've found a strong-looking Trainer\nduring my patrol!\r\nGo, Sigilyph!\c
It is just as I had thought!\nA monstrously strong Trainer!
You see my Sigilyph?\c\nIt always seems to want to take the\nsame exact route, but why is that?
Let's see you take a powerful attack\nfrom veteran Workers like us!\c
We've trained by doing physical work.\nSo even when we lose, we're powerful!
This Worker is happy to have a job that\nlets him be with his favorite Pokémon!
Twist Mountain changes in every season,\nand this old man changes in every battle!\c
Go easy on...\na grown-up?!
This old man likes winter.\c\nSnow on Twist Mountain...\nhas an indescribable beauty.
See the combination of my cool Ice-type\nPokémon and my hot fighting spirit!\c
It looks like you can also make an\nice-and-heat combination!
Twist Mountain is cold all year round!\c\nIt's a great place for Ice-type Pokémon\nthat are happy in the depths of winter!
Hold up, youngster!\nA battle will help you warm up!\c
Hah! Battling gets me so warm that I'm\neven sweating!
You can feel my face if you don't\nbelieve me. See? Dripping with sweat!
Heavy labor is a breeze when you let a\nPsychic-type Pokémon take care of it!\c\nNow I can slack off and take it easy!\c
Oh, I see... If a Trainer starts slacking,\nit'll be his or her Pokémon that suffer.
A real Worker works together with their\nPokémon!\c\nYou cannot just make Pokémon do all the\nwork while you slack off!
It has been two years since I secluded\nmyself here on Twist Mountain...\c\nNow I will take this chance to test the\nresults of my training!\c
Even the most intense training does not\nnecessarily guarantee victory...
If there are those like myself who\ndedicate their lives only to training...\c\nThen there are those like you who\ngrow through your journey?
Triple Battle is a new kind of battle\nwith three Pokémon!
OK! I will show you the results\nof my daily workouts!\c
The result of my daily workout...\ndidn't really show up.\c
I'm going to train my Pokémon properly\nand make sure they grow balanced.\c\nBwahaha! It's the challenges that make\nlife worth living, whatever your age!
Twist Mountain's number one tactician!\nThat's me!\c
Maybe I shouldn't have been satisfied with\njust being number one in Twist Mountain...?
Thank you...\nWith our battle, my eyes have\r\nbeen opened.\c\nBeing number one of Twist Mountain\nis only a stepping-stone on my journey!
A Rotation Battle is a battle using\nthree Pokémon!
In Rotation Battles, it's also important\nto know when NOT to rotate.\c
I've been training for Rotation Battles for\ntwo years now, but it's still not enough...
I'm sure that Grimsley would've\nknown when to rotate...
A lake that spreads beneath the earth...\nAnd the Hiker who waits beside it!\c
You have seized victory with ease,\nyoung Trainer...
This lake was formed by the water from\nunderground rivers...\c\nSuch a clear, flawless blue...
Hold up! Did you know this path was\nsupposedly made ages and ages ago?\c
S-sorry...\nI just got so excited...
Did people really make a tunnel this long\nall those ages ago?\c\nNo, they must have had many Pokémon\nhelping them with the work.\c\nOr they might have been forcing the\nPokémon to help...
It's “The Waving Weaving Walk"--\nWawalk for short!\c\nI wonder what kind of Pokémon\nwe'll meet today?\c
Your Pokémon have good Abilities,\ndon't they?
I totally loved the Wawalk TV show, but\nthey took it off the air.
First, one big last gulp...\c\nHold your breath!\c
Puaaahhh!\n...Holding your breath is really tough!
The air that I just breathed in...\c\nIt could actually be really ancient air\nthat hasn't changed for ages, you know?
Hello, lo, lo!\c
I, I, I...\nLost, lost, lost!
Echo, oh, oh!\c\n...\c\nYour voice really echoes in a path like\nthis one, huh?
My path and yours...\nThey cross here and now...\c
Now that I think about it, I've come\nquite far...
I am going wherever I can have glorious\nbattles against new people...\c\nIt sounds quite daring, doesn't it?
The fact that you are here means...\nthat you are also part of the sewer?!\r\nAll right! Then I will survey you, too!\c
Huh...? Where am I?\nWho are you?
What?! You mean that I got so\ncaught up in my survey of the sewer\r\nthat I ended up in the Relic Passage?!
The sewer and this Relic Passage...\c\nIs it really simple coincidence that they\nexist so close to each other?\c
No, there must be a reason why...\nOh! When did I lose?
Modern men make sewers,\nancient man made these paths...\c\nHave there always been people who just\ncouldn't get enough of digging holes?
I'll borrow this ruin's power to...power\nup my own psychic...powers!\c
So I couldn't just expect that to make my\nPokémon more powerful, too...
The one thing you CAN borrow to get\nstronger is a Rental Pokémon!\c\nOops. Did I just say something I\nshouldn't have?
It's coming... It's coming!\nThe ancient spiritual power!\c
The ancient power!\nThe sacred power!
I feel an extraordinary power emanating\nfrom up ahead!\c\nYes! It is a power that burns as warm and\nbright as the sun!
All right, let me introduce you\nto the other super-cool and cute\r\nmember of my band!\c
If we don't recruit more members,\nthe sound won't have enough depth.
You're a strange kid!\c\nEven though we lost, I think my Pokémon\nhad fun. Look, it's even smiling!
Here I go!\c
Your style is electrifying!
You know what? At first I would practice\nreal quiet so I wouldn't be a bother to\r\nthe Pokémon living here...\c\nBut then guess what happened! Lately\nthe Pokémon come and listen to me play!
This Hiker wandering the expanses of\nthe world will teach a child like you the\r\nharshness of life and the difficulty of\r\nPokémon battles!\c
The teacher was schooled...\nYou're very strict, aren't you?
Sometimes Pokémon are inside dust clouds!
It is the way of greeting high in the\nmountains and down in the caves.\c\nThat's right! We each get out our\nPokémon, and then we begin!\c
Farewell...\nFarewell, my victory...
Long ago, Pokémon and people\nlived separately.\c\nAnd now we live all together like this...\c\nI don't know if it is a good thing or not,\nbut it will surely lead to many changes.
This cave is full of rocks\ngenerating electricity!\r\nThe electricity is charging me up!\c
Yowch, a lightning spark!
The sources of my energy are\nmy precious Pokémon!\r\nThis has been scientifically proven!!
I love this place! The electricity\ncharges up my inspiration!\c
Aha!\nThat made a lightbulb go on in my head!
When a person moves,\nelectric signals travel in the body!\c\nAlso, when a person has an inspiration,\nelectric signals travel to the brain!
I am a Pokémon Ranger, here to gather\nup some electric power!\c
Whoa! Can I still not draw forth my\nelectrifying powers?!
Take this.\c
I don't know if it's unfair or just plain\ncool when Pokémon use electricity!
There was a whisper on the wind that told\nme of your coming!\c
I will become the wind and blow...
Oh! I almost forgot!\nI found some Chesto Berries, so...\c
Wind blows into caves when you're\nclose to an entrance or exit.
The magic number is three! You need\nthree healthy Pokémon who can fight!
Behold the destructive force created\nby my three prized Pokémon!\c
Your combined force as a team is greater\nthan ours!
Perhaps I need to meet my Pokémon head-\non... Then we could be a stronger team!
I researched on the PC the best way\nto battle, and now I'm sure to win!\c
Seriously?
What I found on the PC was just someone\nelse's idea and not an answer that I had\r\ncome up with myself...
For a Rotation Battle, you've got to\nhave three Pokémon, you know!
My three beloved Pokémon will make their\ndebut in a perfect, weaving triangle.\c
You were the one who had the stronger\ncombined power as a team?!
With Rotation Battles, do you think that\nmaybe you need some Pokémon that can\r\ntake attacks, not just deal them out?
Hey! My Pokémon are great.\nLook, look!\c
Argh!!
I am called an Ace Trainer, but\nthat doesn't sit well with me.\c\n'Cause I just love Pokémon,\nand I just want to be strong!
When Pokémon Trainers meet,\nwhat we do is, of course,\r\nengage in a Pokémon battle, don't we?\c
Oh no...\nI'm pathetic...
Perhaps I meet people here because of\nguidance from my Pokémon.
Oh?\nYou want to have a battle with me?\c\nAll right!\nI have a strong Pokémon.\c
That's right.\nThe Pokémon is no longer with me.
...That's not true.\nAs long as I remember,\r\nit will be with me forever.
Let us have our Pokémon battle with\ngentlemanly reserve!\c
Ho, ho, ho! Quite the affront!
I have enjoyed every day I spend with\nmy Pokémon.\c\nIf only my Pokémon feel the same way,\nthen I can die happy!
Oh my, what a young Trainer.\nIf it's all right, why don't we battle?\c
There at the end, I nearly called out my\nlate Pokémon's name...
Is it a good thing to forget your Pokémon\nafter they are gone?\r\nOr is it better when you cannot forget?
Let's show the resting spirits\nthe dazzling splendor of life!\c
Hm...?\nWas that a spirit just now?
When I come to Celestial Tower,\nstrangely, I feel the urge to fight.\c\nDoes it broadcast some sort of signal\nthat makes me want to fight?
I'm here to understand the end\nof the world, but I don't quite get it.\c\nIf I have a battle,\nwill I be enlightened...?\c
The end...\nIs that it?
People, Pokémon...\nEven if the world is gone,\r\nthat is not the end.
Indescribable energy\nis flowing to me!\c
The energy is escaping...\nAww...
The thoughts and wishes of the Pokémon\nthat rest here also provide energy!
...I still want to fight!\c\nThe wandering spirits are\nstill commanding me!\c
Hah... Hah...\nThe spirit just left me.
So many voices fill this tower,\neternally silenced...\r\nIf only someone would just listen...
I love Bug-type Pokémon, and I love\nbug catching!\c\nOf course I looove Pokémon battles, too!\c
I won't lose to anyone when it comes to bug\ncatching, yet I...
If I catch all of the Bug-type Pokémon in\nthe Unova region, I can get a Bug-type\r\nCatcher Medal!\c\nThat's what I'm aiming for!
My Pokémon's poison really stings!\c
What a defeat!\nI guess I got a taste of my own poison!
A little sting, and then the slow\ndrain begins...\c\nThe super-technical way that Poison-type\nPokémon attack is so cool!
I was taught by Master Cheren himself\nhow to battle with Pokémon!\c
Nooo way!\nYou're stronger than Master Cheren?!
The more that you study Pokémon, the\nmore you'll understand them.\r\nIt's, like, way too much fun!
We'll put together our power to fight!\nTwo is better than one!\c
Rae: You're even more in sync than we are!\c\nUla: Boo-hoo-hooo! We lost!
I have to watch out for my sister's\nPokémon when we battle.\r\nI'm the big sister, after all!
We're still pretty small, so we can only\nstand up to others by working together.\c\nThat's why we battle with two Pokémon\nat the same time!
Two! Two! Two is better!\n...But what's “better" mean?\c
I still don't get a lot of things...\c\nBut Pokémon are cute, and battling sure\nis fun!
Mommy and Daddy told me that I have\nto play fair.\c\nSo you've got to have two Pokémon to do\na Double Battle!
My Pokémon are gonna steam you out!\c
We haven't lost in terms of dampness...\nI'm gonna keep believing that!
It sure is great to be all sodden.\c\nWho was the one who got to decide that\nbright, airy places are best?
Is that a Pokédex?!\c\nI'd love it if you would show me\nlots of different kinds of Pokémon!\c
...!\nI've never seen a Pokémon like that.
Hmm... I wonder if I would meet some new\nPokémon if I went to the swamp?
Rotation Battles are battles\nwith three Pokémon!
The splish-splosh sounds! Those were\nyour footsteps, weren't they?\r\nSo cute!\c
You are so strong--too strong to be cute!
According to footstep fortune-telling...\c\nThose whose footsteps make a splish and\na splosh are Trainers that Pokémon like.
Triple Battles use three Pokémon!
If you turn a parasol around,\nit's like a flower blossoming in the rain!\c
Whee! I'll spin around my parasol and send\nsome water droplets flying your way!
On rainy days, use a parasol,\nwear a coat, or get wet.\r\nDo as you like!
Real Fishermen are impatient!\nSo we must battle immediately!\c
I lost!\nIt's the end!!
How do I know that real Fishermen\nare so impatient?\c\nBecause we change places frantically\nif we cannot catch Pokémon!
Knowing oneself, knowing the other,\nand knowing the surroundings...\r\nThat's a Ranger!\c
Knowing your opponent is a difficult feat!
Do you know about this?\c
If you know what kind of wild Pokémon\ninhabit an area, you can bring along\r\nPokémon who are strong against them and\r\nwill have no problem moving ahead.
Pokémon Trainers nurture friendship\nwith their battles!\c
This feeling of defeat...\nis like a bottomless swamp...
Lum Berries make a great token\nof friendship!\c
Stay still and listen carefully!\nHear the sounds of nearby Pokémon...\r\nthe breath of trees and swamps.
If there are Trainers,\nI just have battles with them.\c
I've never seen\nsuch a strong Trainer!
I'll battle with anyone.\c\nBecause they may show me Water-type\nPokémon I've never seen.
Just a little bit more...\nI just need that spark!\c
...I've done it!\nThis haiku will be my magnum opus!
I see myself there,\nreflected in the still lake.\r\nA silent defeat...
Strength that goes beyond mere Abilities...\nYou there! You're a real tough one, huh!
More!\nLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I still have my last friend...\nWe won't ever give up!
I will accept my friend's pain as my own and\ndo this!
The love for your Pokémon permeates\nevery cell of your body. I felt it!
More!\nLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I still have my last friend...\nWe won't ever give up!
I will accept my friend's pain as my own,\nand the move I will choose is this!
The love for your Pokémon that permeates\nevery cell of your body. I accept it!
Why don't you prove to me how much you\nand your Pokémon are capable of!\c
You are capable of far more than we are!\nThat has certainly been proven!
There actually wasn't any need to prove\nhow strong we are.\c\nI already know how capable my Pokémon\nand I are!
I'll use my psychic powers to release my\nPokémon from its Poké Ball!\c
Well, that didn't go the way I wanted it to!
I hear that Caitlin of the Elite Four is\nan amazing Psychic.\r\nI'd sure love to face her head-on...
You... Who's brought you this far?\c
It's your reliable Pokémon who brought you\nthis far, isn't it?
You know what I think? All people know\nwhat they can do alone, but...\c\nThere are a lot of things you can only do\nwith Pokémon, too!
You are no ordinary opponent...\c\nThat is what my Ghost-type Pokémon is\nwhispering to me.\c
My premonition was spot on!\nI knew you were no ordinary opponent!
Could it be that you and your Pokémon\nare the ones emitting that strong aura?!
It's not enough for me just to be\ntogether with Pokémon!\c\nI want to win!\c
Ugh! How... How...\nHow could you defeat me this utterly?!
It's not enough for me just to be\ntogether with Pokémon! I want to win!\c\nBut I do know that some people feel at\nease just by being with their Pokémon...
Our unity won't be bested by anyone!\c
We couldn't win...\nBut that's all right.
My Pokémon was once stolen by\nTeam Plasma.\c\nI'm just so grateful that we can be\ntogether like this now.
Wait!\nYou, young Trainer over there!\c\nLook at my Pokémon.\c
Not bad!\nI like your strength.
I'd love to brag about my Pokémon, but it\nwould take too long, so I'll resist!
I am a Doctor!\c\nIf you have Pokémon in bad shape...\nLet me see your Pokémon in battle!\c
Your strength is fathomless!\nI am deeply impressed.
Whether your Pokémon are healthy\nor not, I'll restore them to full health!\c
I aim to be the best Doctor in the world!\c\nBut my first step will be to become the\nbest Doctor in Unova.
Behold the blinding brilliance of my many\nGym Badges!\c
Your skill is too brilliant to behold!\nIt's so bright that I can't see anything!
That Badge you have there...\c\nNo, it is your skill and the Pokémon with\nyou that are so brilliantly shining!
Something about you reminds me of that\nTrainer from two years ago...\c
Yes, that mix of kindness and power is just\nlike that Trainer!
I wonder where that Trainer is now...
The people who pass by here\nhave such different moods!\c\nIt's fun to watch, and even more fun\nto fight against them!\c
Mwa haha!\nIt's fun!
Your Pokémon was in a really good mood\nthe moment that you won!
Are you sure? I'm strong, you know.\nYou still want to take me on?\c
Yes, I'm sure... I'm weak, you know.\nWhy did you want to take me on?
Not wanting to admit my own limits,\nI am continuing to battle on...\r\nThat's right! At least I'm persistent!
Are you sure you want to seriously take\non someone like me, who seriously fights\r\nwith her Pokémon?\c
This is the pain that comes from seriously\nfacing someone head-on...
I battle seriously, because I am after\nserious strength.\c\nThere's nothing worse than a\nhalfhearted opponent.
All right! You look like an opponent who\nwill really highlight my weaknesses!\c
Now I see my faults clearly! If I can work\non them, I'll be even stronger!
Accept your own weaknesses. That\nis the first step to getting stronger.
All I want are powerful Pokémon!\c
I can't comprehend this!\nHow could my partner lose?!
All I want are powerful Pokémon!\c\nOnly a Pokémon that understands that\ncan become one of my partners!
Life is all about overcoming hurdles!\nCould you be a hurdle for me?\c
I couldn't overcome the hurdle you\npresented to me...
If you can't overcome a hurdle, you can\nalways just go around it.\c\nHead up here, and you'll find the\ngreatest hurdle for Trainers:\r\nthe Pokémon League.
One, you are a Pokémon Trainer.\nTwo, I am an Ace Trainer.\c\nPut them together, and it's obvious that\nwe are going to battle!\c
One, you won!\nTwo, I lost...
One, I'm strong.\nTwo, you're stronger.\c\nPut them together, and you are clearly\na stronger Pokémon Trainer than I am!
I want to show how much I love Pokémon\nby winning!\c
I can't show my love for Pokémon if I go\nand lose!
I-I can't express my gratitude toward\nmy Pokémon except by winning.\c\nWhat should I do?
The endless cycle of wins and losses...\nWill it always continue?\c
Every win and loss is a precious memory.
Fighting together with a young kid like\nyou makes me feel young again myself.
I'm gonna numb you and your Pokémon!\c
Unbelievable!\nI was the one struck numb...?
This is the best thing for when you're\nreally numb.\c
A fighting style overflowing with power or\na strategy that excels technically...\r\nIt depends on the Pokémon, see!
A heated battle is good, but get too hot\nand you might end up getting burned!\c
Amazing...\nI think I got a bit singed.
If you get burned, be sure to use this!\c
Burning competitiveness and cool logic...\c\nYou'll need both if you're going to go\nup against the Pokémon League.
I just felt a great wind...\nAre you the one who kicked it up?\c
This defeat will also be blown far away...
You are the wind.\c\nA supple and comforting wind blowing\nthrough Victory Road!
I am...\c\nEx-Team Plasma!\c
Eek! You are like that Trainer from two\nyears ago!
There are some people who don't love\nPokémon even if they're strong.\c\nAnd there are some people who love even\nthe weakest Pokémon.
You bothered to come all the way here?\c\nGood! I will reward your hard work by\nbattling with all of my strength!\c
A battle with a good Trainer fills my heart\nwith warmth.
The fact that you made it out here...\c\nThat's it! It must have been thanks to a\nPokémon carrying you with a hidden move!
Hey, since you worked so hard to get\nhere, how about I be your opponent?\c
Thanks a bunch.\nIt was a lot of fun!
My Pokémon lets me ride on its back as\nit uses Surf or Waterfall.\r\nI really feel its love at those times!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\ncommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\ncommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\ncommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\ncommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
This Pokémon battle... It will forever\ncommemorate my visit to Castelia City!
I hate to admit it, but...\nYou're a good Trainer.
Have you gotten even stronger than you\nwere in Lacunosa Town?\r\nHow, in such a brief amount of time...
You little...\nYou knocked out my stupid pawns!
Even if I lose, I will not give up on justice\nfor Team Plasma! That's all!
Argh! Lame! Stupid! Fool! Plasmaaaa!
The pain of my Pokémon...\nI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\nmy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\nNo! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...\nI did my best, but we lost...
Why was I so conceited as to think I could\nshow you anything?
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll on!\nRoller coaster!
What!\nMy victory was taken away from me!
As a Doctor, I will be examining your\nPokémon's strength!\c
Oh! What's this?\nIt is the very picture of health!
Before you go, let me give your Pokémon\na little booster shot!\c
Feel free to drop by anytime your\nPokémon need a little TLC!
I'll battle Pokémon even if I can't find\na pulse!\c
It wasn't just a pulse I couldn't find...\nI couldn't get the prize either...
I may have lost the prize, but I'll still\nmake your Pokémon healthy and hearty!\c
To make people healthy,\nDoctors go where they are needed.
You need a Nurse's help?\c\nSure, if you can win against me,\nI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\c
Come on!\nYour team is really healthy!
OK! Then...\nTime to give your Pokémon some energy!\c
Making Pokémon feel better--that's what\nI am here for!
People with a strong life force look so\nvibrant and alive!\c
Your life force is positively blinding!\nUgh! What is this?!
All right, here I go!\nLife force to the max!\c
You guys push your life force to the max!\nJust keep on pushing boundaries!
I'm wandering the world trying to find a\nplace where I belong...\r\nHow about you?\c
I lost...\nSo this isn't where I belong either...
You don't just find your place in\nthe world. You've got to make it!
If you want to know what I've got in my\nbackpack, why don't you try to beat me!\c
Whoaaa!\nI'm going to be buried!
My backpack is full of sand from\nthe desert.\c\nIt's my job to dig out Relic Castle before\nit gets completely buried!
A desert is like one giant sandbox, right?\nSo come on, let's let our Pokémon play!\c
Since this is for play, whoever has the most\nfun is the winner!
How about I just make a huge sandcastle\nin the place of that old Relic Castle\r\nthat's getting buried?
No matter how desperately I try to scoop\nup the sand, it flows through my fingers.\r\nIt's kind of sad somehow...\c
Victory slips away...\nYes, just like the sand...
These words are meant for you...\c\nBe careful, but never be afraid of\nthe journey.
I will show you the harshness\nof the desert through a battle!\c
Desert...hot... Mouth...dry... Grfrrrfl...
Be careful of burns!\c
If a Pokémon gets a burn,\nit also weakens physical attacks.\r\nThis works quite well!
Scorching desert!\nA passion for adventure!\r\nAnd a heated battle!\c
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!!
Speed is crucial\nto treat a burn!\c
Whether it is hot or cold,\nthere is no problem if you have passion!
I will use my supernatural powers to\nhelp my Pokémon!\c
Wow! That's amazing!
Drawing out your Pokémon's power\nlike that...\c\nI think that is a real\nsupernatural power.
Hrmm... You're strong, aren't you?\c\nIt's kind of tough when you know that\nbefore you even start to fight.\c
Urk! It's almost as if I didn't have ESP...\nI can't do anything against you.
I like to play tag with my Pokémon\nwhen they use Teleport.
I am a Trainer before I'm a Nurse!\c\nI am itching for a Pokémon battle!\c
I was so itchy that I couldn't\nfight properly!
OK, let's get you all fixed up!\nJust leave it up to me!\c
Be careful of sandstorms as you explore\nthe Desert Resort!
My great loves in life are...\nMountains! Food! Pokémon!\r\nBut food deserves to go in there twice!\c
Oh, ho ho!\nYou got me!
When you pick the simplest-looking path,\nit often turns out to be a dead end.
I'm chasing my dream,\nand I'm fighting for a victory!\c
I can't catch that dream!
There was once a legendary Pokémon\nhidden away in this cave.\c\nWhat do you think it felt?\nWhat do you think it was hoping for?
If there is a steep cave in the east,\nI go there and train my Pokémon, and\r\nif there is a strong Trainer in the west,\r\nI go there and challenge that Trainer!\c
My Pokémon clearly lack\nproper training!!
Pokémon training Pokémon...\c\nIf they live in rugged wilderness,\nthat can happen naturally.
Wait a sec!\c\nLet me grip my Poké Ball a little\nbit tighter.\c\n...Yeah, like that! Now I'm good!\c
Squeeze!
If you hold your Poké Ball tight when\nyou're feeling unsure, your Pokémon will\r\ncheer you on!\r\nThat's why I'm OK!
I will unveil my Pokémon to you!\nThey are the best in the world!\c
Your Pokémon are also cute,\nbut my Pokémon are charming!
Listen. My love for my Pokémon\nis the best in the world.\r\nNobody can beat it.
I'm planning on transferring a Pokémon\nusing Poké Transfer.\r\nBut before I do...\c
Phew... I should have just transferred\nmy Pokémon after all, huh?
To meet your Pokémon beyond the\nconstraints of time and distance...\c\nThe desire to meet like that has sure led\nto some amazing inventions, huh?
Huh? Your Pokémon...\nThey escaped from Poké Transfer?!\c
Sooorry!\nI took you for someone else!
The Poké Transfer is an amazing device\nthat allows you to transport Pokémon.
When you embark on a journey, you\ndiscover many joys...\r\nWhat will I discover fighting you?\c
The joy of victory and sorrow of defeat--\nboth gone in an instant...
I learned this lesson when I got to the\nend of my journey.\c\nJoy can be fleeting.\nBut true happiness never ends...\r\nJust as your Pokémon will never leave.
I've got lots of items in my backpack!\nI'll use them well to secure victory!\c
When you have too many moves and items, you\ncan actually end up a bit overwhelmed...
If you're overwhelmed, throw 'em away!\nYou don't want to be weighed down when\r\nyou're traveling.\r\nAll you really need is your Pokémon.
Hi, hi! Trainer!\c\nI will let you see\nwhat kind of Pokémon I have!\c
Oooh, quit bugging me!
I'll bring out all the great sides of Bug-\ntype Pokémon for everyone to see...\r\nI'm gonna be just like Burgh someday!
Hi, hi! Trainer!\c\nPlease show me what kinds of Pokémon\nyou are training!\c
Great, great! I didn't know\nthat way to raise Pokémon!
When you let a Pokémon evolve, it will be\nstronger, but if you don't let it evolve,\r\nit will learn moves quicker.
Hey, Trainer! Let's have a refreshing\nbattle and blow away all my troubles!\c
You guys...\nYou feel like an unbeatable combination.
I've been thinking lately.\c\nEven if I were somehow separated from my\nPokémon, would they choose me as their\r\nTrainer again...?
Oh my! My Pokémon really seem raring\nto go today!\c\nSo I guess that means I'll be asking you\nfor a battle!\c
It seems my Pokémon weren't\nas ready as I thought!
Pokémon are alive, just like you or me, so\nit's no wonder that they might feel down.\r\nWhen that happens, just let them take\r\nit easy.
I trained and trained like a madman,\nand my Pokémon trained even more!\c
Yeah! Yeah!\nEven though I lost, I'm energetic!
My Fighting-type Pokémon!\nI train it to smash the challenge rock!
I test the challenge rock\nwith my fist every day!\c\nIt is important to make steady progress,\nlittle by little.\c
I still have not\ntried hard enough!
I test the challenge rock every day\nwith my Pokémon!\c\nWhy don't you check out\nthe challenge rock\r\nwith a Fighting-type Pokémon?
I'm the one who patrols Pinwheel Forest\nfrom one end to the other!\r\nA battle here is a piece of cake!\c
What a huge mistake to lose\na battle in Pinwheel Forest!
A Ranger always has one of these.\nI'll give it to you!\c
The forest is alive...\c\nSomething changes every day,\nso it's fun to patrol!
Melding into the wild landscape...\nThat's what a Pokémon Ranger does!\c
I am such a weakling!\nI will disappear back into the wilderness!
I'm sure you can fully\nutilize this.\c
If you blend into the wilderness too well,\nyou won't be noticed by Pokémon,\r\nlet alone by people.
Haaah... Whoooosh...\nHaaah... Whoooosh...\c\nOK! After deep-breathing exercises\ncomes the time for a Pokémon battle!\c
All that I can do now is sigh in sorrow...
But I can also do this!\c
Different Pokémon can be found\nin different places.\c\nDoes that mean there is\na perfect place for everyone?
Get great powers drawn from nature\nwithout opposing it.\r\nThat is the strength of Rangers!\c
What great power!\nYour Pokémon are marvelous!
This is one of the powers\nI got from nature.\c
Pokémon are just too amazing, so we\nend up depending on them for everything.\r\nGreat power can be dangerous.
I came here because this place feels\nquite nostalgic to me...\c\nBut now I'd rather battle with you than\nstroll down memory lane!\c
I see... So that's it.\nI used to also be that focused long ago.
I am reminded of my childhood and chasing\ninnocently after Bug-type Pokémon...\c\nIt was that day, in this very place, that\nI started on the path to “Trainerhood."
Let me show you the Pokémon that I\nmet by fate!\c
The Pokémon that you've met are quite\nformidable, aren't they?
Young kids sure have it good.\nThey get to meet all kinds of Pokémon!
Shorts and Pokémon!\nThis is the ultimate combination!\c
It's not my Pokémon's fault!\nIt's not my shorts' fault either!
I'm wearing shorts to help toughen up\nmy kneecaps! Do you want to feel them?
My Pokémon's strong points!\nYou'll see them if you fight!\c
Hey! Did you see\nmy Pokémon's strong points?!
My Pokémon's strong points?\c\nHmmm...\c\nI don't know, 'cause there are too many!
You...are a rather adult-looking kid...\nA kiddish adult... Oh, jeez!\r\nI'll just find out when we battle!\c
You are a childish and adult and altogether\nmysterious Trainer!
A precocious child or a childish adult...\c\nBoth can be hard to deal with, but both\nare also cute in their way!
The forest is full of little hollows and\nhillocks, and walking in it is so fun!\c\nAnd you know, having Pokémon battles is\neven more fun!\c
Your Pokémon are soooo cool!
I want to ride through the forest on a\nPokémon!
Oh! And I just heard a Pokémon, too!\nOh, boo...\c
Your Pokémon seemed kinda happy, Trainer!
There are Pokémon hiding beyond\nthose bushes!
Instead of a Dragon-type Pokémon, I've\nfound myself a spectacular Trainer!\c
You were spectacular and, more than that,\nso strong!
I'm going to like Dragon-type Pokémon\nbecause I want to talk to Drayden!
We're best friends!\nOur Pokémon are best friends, too!\c
Ally: Even if we lose...\c\nAmy: ...We'll still be best friends!
We're gonna be best friends forever and\never, right?
Bring two Pokémon here, OK?\nPretty, pretty please!
Our Pokémon are best friends, too!\c
We play with two Pokémon!\nIt just won't work with one!
After all, the two of us are like\none person!
We feel filled with power when we're\nsurrounded by our beloved stone!\c
Oh stones!\nThis can't be stooone!
I'm not the only one who gets excited by\nall this stone--my Pokémon do, too!
Oh! Trainer!\nDo you want to learn a bitter lesson?\c
Training complete!\nI think I may've improved a bit.
No need to rush!\c\nI'm just a normal person, so there's no\nway I can become the best all at once!
...Are you sure you want someone like me?\nOne moping around in a place like this?\c
If only he was also as strong as you are...
When you like someone, you try to show\nthem your good points, don't you?\c\nWell, I went and thoroughly beat the guy\nthat I liked in a Pokémon battle...
I've overcome my fear of Pokémon!\c
Mm-hmm! You really love Pokémon, don't you?
There are people who are afraid of\nPokémon, too.\r\nThough everyone seems to forget that.
Just three more people!\c\nI won't leave this spot till I win against\nthree more people!\c
Whoa!\nYour Pokémon were amazing!!
Heh! If beating an opponent is also a kind\nof strength then...\c\nI guess sticking to something you've\ndecided to do is also a kind of strength!
These Pokémon were born\non the same day and raised together!\c
Oh!\nYou're pretty good!
Our days with Pokémon\nare full of happiness, and\r\nour joys will grow as we live together!
...So what.
I'm just a shadow, after all...
How disappointing...
Plasmaaaa!\nI lost! This is awful!
I may look like a regular Clerk ♀, but\nin fact I am a glamorous female spy!\r\nCan you feel it? How strong I am?\c
Oh! This spy has failed her mission!
I am investigating the new CEO as part of\nmy work as a female spy.\r\nI'll find out what he's hiding!\c\nBut he couldn't really be a child,\ncould he? That's just ridiculous!
I've got to reach my quota.\nThat's why I'm challenging you.\c
Ohhh... I lost, but I've also come up with\na brilliant proposal!
As part of the Battle Company, we office\nworkers have to complete many Pokémon\r\nbattles and fulfill our quotas!
I saw that move coming from miles away!
We will put everything on the line for this\nmove! Right, partner?!
...Phew!\nYou're really something!
I saw that move coming from miles away!
We will put everything on the line for this\nmove! Right, partner?!
...Phew!\nYou're really something!
I saw that move coming from miles away!
We will put everything on the line for this\nmove! Right, partner?!
...Phew!\nYou're really something!
Battling against you always gets me\nriled up!
Like I'd lose to you!
This bitter...yet refreshing feeling.
Battling against you always gets me\nriled up!
Like I'd lose to you!
This bitter...yet refreshing feeling.
Battling against you always gets me\nriled up!
Like I'd lose to you!
This bitter...yet refreshing feeling.
My Pokémon seems to be in pain!\nMy partner's pain is my pain!
I can feel it! Our minds are one right now,\nme and my partner's!
Just as I'd expected! You are really\ndrawing forth your Pokémon's power!
My Pokémon seems to be in pain!\nMy partner's pain is my pain!

Just as I'd expected! You are really\ndrawing forth your Pokémon's power!
S-s-still... That's fine.\nWe're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,\nI am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!\nIt was a lot of fun!
S-s-still... That's fine.\nWe're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,\nI am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!\nIt was a lot of fun!
S-s-still... That's fine.\nWe're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,\nI am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!\nIt was a lot of fun!
I will use everything that I've learned in\nmy life until now!
My Pokémon and I will\nput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\nYou are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned in\nmy life until now!
My Pokémon and I will\nput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\nYou are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned in\nmy life until now!
My Pokémon and I will\nput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\nYou are really great.
That pressure I felt from you just now...\nWhat was that?!
What a blunder to have made\nin front of Zinzolin...
My goal is to outperform Gym Leaders!\c
My Pokémon fought well, didn't they?
When those triplets at Striaton\nRestaurant go back to being Gym Leaders,\r\nI'll be the first in line to challenge 'em!
Real battle is the best way to learn!\c
I'll learn from losing, as well!
If you're working toward a goal, then\nanything can be a chance to learn!\c\n...That's what Cheren said before he\nbecame the Gym Leader.
I'm going to review everything I learned\nin the Trainers' School!\c
I'll have to work on that move some more...
What kind of person is that Cheren guy\nat Aspertia City's Trainers' School?
This is a power spot!\nIt awakens your dormant power!\c
Did you spot my weakness?
Long ago there was this Pokémon called\nMusharna here that could eat dreams...\r\nand even make dreams real, or so\r\npeople say.
Eeek! Why? I foresaw your move,\nand I was running away from you.\c
Eeek! I foresaw your thoughts,\nbut I lost!
You can't help but to chase after what\nruns and to want what you can't have!
Let us conduct some Pokémon research.\nYes, let us show each other our Pokémon.\c
Mm, mm! A new discovery and an\never-deepening mystery...
The more you research, the more you\ncan discover.\c\nBut with Pokémon, you can become friends\neven without understanding everything.
The mysterious psychic power! You cannot\nsee it, yet it is definitely there!\c
Argh! It's always like this!\nI cannot see what really matters!
The hole in a donut... There is nothing\nthere, and yet it exists. I love that!
Going through trials is the best for\ngrowing stronger!\c
You were the perfect trial!\nI mean, come on, you're so strong!
We raise our Pokémon by having\nthem battle!\c\nThat's why I'll be asking you for a\nPokémon battle every time you come here!
My serve is 120 miles per hour!\c\nThat's the kind of killer attack I'm\nabout to show you!\c
Ohhh, I wanted to continue the rally just a\nlittle bit longer!
A rally that goes on for ages--it's\ntough but still so fulfilling!
Watch my furious tennis footwork!\nYou get it now? We're really tough!\c
But...but I'm tough enough to go all day\nand all night...
Someday I want to play a doubles match\nwith pairs of people and Pokémon.
If only you had three Pokémon that were\nready for battle!
Oh! You look pretty good!\nLet's play some pickup!\c
That's game!\nYou totally crushed me.
I wanna play at Small Court in\nNimbasa City someday...
You don't even have three healthy\nPokémon? That's just odd!
Fooling you fair and square!\nThat's what we call a trick play!\c
What the hoops?\nI was the one who was tricked!
How are you gonna get past an opponent?\nThat's vital for battles and basketball.
See my extraordinarily pretty Pokémon!\c
Ahh! Its fire has been weakened?!
When you feel a Pokémon breathing, you\ncan really feel how alive they are!
L-E-T-S-G-O! Let's go! Let's go!\c\nWe cheer on any Trainer who tries\nhis or her best!\c
May: Go, go, Pokémon!\nMal: Fight, fight, Trainer!
The Trainer's commands call out!\nThe Pokémon's moves are decided!
There're two of us, right?\nSo we wanna fight with two Pokémon!
Let's go! Let's go! L-E-T-S-G-O!\c\nWe cheer on every Pokémon that fights!\c
If the Pokémon and the Trainer don't\nboth do their best, they won't win!
We love Double Battles! Understand?
I fight for my love of Pokémon!\c
Your love of Pokémon really came through...
That's your love of Pokémon!\nHere's my love of Pokémon!\c
My love of Pokémon will always make them\nfeel better.
Are people from the outside all so strong?
Have we just been ignorant of the world?
There's nothing left for me to say after a\nbeating like that!
More!\nLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
For the sake of my friend who saved me, I\nwill never give up!
You've got to value this time that you\nhave to get to know each other!
Your Pokémon are happy...\nThey are happy to be with you.
More!\nLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
For the sake of my friend who saved me, I\nwill never give up!
You've got to value this time that you\nhave to get to know each other!
Your Pokémon are happy...\nThey are happy to be with you.

More!\nLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
For the sake of my friend who saved me, I\nwill never give up!
You've got to value this time that you\nhave to get to know each other!
Your Pokémon are happy...\nThey are happy to be with you.
To have chosen that move...\nI see! You'll be a powerful opponent!
As a Gym Leader, I aim to be a wall for\nyou to overcome!
This! This is what a real\nPokémon battle is!
I can feel your desire to win\npouring out of you!
It's not over yet! Time to turn\nthis show around for a victory!
Wait!\nI was right in the middle of the chorus!
Lights, please! Time to show you\nwhat Bug-type Pokémon are made of!
Mmm... I've got a bad feeling about this!\nCould I be in trouble?
Hmm... It's over!\nYou're incredible!
You and your Pokémon's moves\nare simply dazzling!
I've got to overcome this situation!\nI can't let my fans down!
You shocked me through and through!\nYou melted my heart!
Impressive!\nThat's some strength you've got!
No hard feelings, but\nI'm extremely stubborn!
Man oh man... It feels good to go all\nout and still be defeated!
When I think about how you might\nattack, it's like I'm walking on air!
Never give up! To do so is an insult to the\nPokémon who fight for you!
I won't forget this battle!\nI'm glad that I could fight against you!
Whatever move you chose, it fills me with the\nheat of battle!
My blood burns with even more fire at\nthis age! I've still got some fight in me!
This bitterness that floods me after\na defeat...\c\nThe heart that does not succumb to such a\nfeeling is filled with energy and life!
Dude...\nYou're really into this, huh!
Awww, dude... I know I'm about done,\nbut I'm still just so pumped up!
You totally rocked that!\nYou're raising some wicked Pokémon.\r\nYou got this Trainer thing down!
First impressions are everything!
It's not over yet!\nI'll finish it my way!
I hope for a good ending! I hate endings\nthat leave a bitter taste in one's mouth!
Do you ever feel at a loss for words when\nsomething greatly moves you?\r\nTo tell the truth...\c\nI'm a writer, but right now I'm having\ntrouble putting my feelings into words.\c\nYou were just that impressive!
Now why would you use that move? If I can\nfigure that out, I may be able to win!
A beautiful loss is still a loss,\nand an ugly win is still a win!
Even in a tough situation like this,\nthere must be a way to triumph!
Where there's a winner,\nthere's also a loser.\c\nIt's pathetic to make a big deal out\nof losing if you weren't prepared.\c\nIf you're a true Pokémon battler,\nyou'll reflect upon your loss and\r\nthink about how to win next time!
I can feel it!\nYou and your Pokémon are strong!
This is my final Pokémon!\nIt all comes down to this!
Everything comes down to this next move!\nI'll use the last bit of my strength!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\nor sole best combination...\c\nThat's why it is difficult\nto keep winning.\c\nHowever, I think a heart that desires\nstrength and strives to grow\r\nstronger is a precious ideal.\c\nThat is why I respect you--\nbecause you have these things.
I have a feeling this battle will give my\nPokémon a chance to go all out!
I can't believe it's come to this!\nI must have gotten complacent.
Ohhh, that's it! I'll go all out if it'll get\nme a win!
You and your Pokémon are\nboth excellent and elegant.\c\nTo have been able to battle against\nsuch a splendid team...\c\nMy Pokémon and I learned a lot!\nI offer you my thanks.
It's important to make a good first\nimpression on your opponent!
It's the final chapter!\nHere's my last Pokémon!
I really want a happy ending this time!\nI hate endings that leave a bitter taste.
Wow. I'm stunned.\c\nFor all the words I know, I can't figure out\nhow to say this... Putting my feelings\r\ninto words would just be a trap.\c\nAll I will say is I feel you're even greater\nthan I thought!
I never thought you would use that move...\nNot a bad choice at all.
Those who give up on themselves\ncan never claim victory!
There's got to be a way to win...\nEven in the most extreme of conditions!
Which Pokémon should I raise?\c\nWhich moves should I teach my Pokémon?\c\nWhat items should I give my Pokémon?\c\nYou need to think everything through very\nthoroughly if you want to win!\c\nIn that sense, you're a very\nimpressive battler!
Oh! Strong as usual.\nThat makes my heart dance!
I may have only one Pokémon remaining,\nbut its strength knows no limits!
I'll put everything I have into\nthis next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\nor sole best combination...\c\nThat's why it is difficult\nto keep winning.\c\nHowever, I think a heart that desires\nstrength and strives to grow\r\nstronger is a precious ideal.\c\nThat is why I respect you--\nbecause you have these things.
I will show you how harmonious\nmy Pokémon and I are!
Battling in extreme conditions\nlike this makes me stronger!
I will control my emotions and use them\nas energy to help me obtain victory!
As impressive as always...\c\nNo. You and your Pokémon were even\nmore elegant and excellent than before!\c\nTo have been able to battle against\nsuch a splendid team...\c\nMy Pokémon and I learned so much!\nI offer you my thanks.\r\nPlease battle me again sometime.
This is my path!\c
This is everyone's path!
Go forth on your path!
Ai! Ai! Ai!\nHi-yaaah!\c
Aww...\nIt was my turn next...
If you like sparring with Pokémon, you've\ngot to see Drayden in Opelucid City!\r\nHe's my idol!
Hi-ho!\c
Hi-ho...
Once you've reached the top of a peak,\nthere's no place to go but down.\c\nLife is full of ups and downs.
Hey there, future Champion!\c
Gwahaha! When someone wins, their opponent\nhas to lose. Isn't that right?
If there were no Pokémon, we wouldn't\nworry about who's strong or who's weak.\c\nBut we also wouldn't have had the chance\nto meet and battle like this, I suppose.
Let's fight!\c
You took a win from me!\nArrrgh! It's so frustrating!
I'll use the bitterness of this defeat\nto reach even greater heights!\c\nThat's right! There'd be no progress\nin the world without loss!
Your Pokémon must be really something if\nyou're here on Route 23!\c
Hahaha! Pokémon are so much fun!
It's lots of fun here, 'cause there're\nonly awesome Pokémon. I'm so pumped!
I keep a tally of all of the times that I\nhave won or lost up until today.\c\nIf I battle against you, I wonder which\nnumber will be increased.\c
So my number of losses went up...
I'm not interested in anything\nbut Pokémon!\c\nIt may not be balanced, but I'm satisfied\nliving like this!
This is the concerto I perform with my\nmost beloved Pokémon!\c
Your side is much more in harmony!
I have been together with Pokémon since\nI was born, and I've battled my\r\nwhole life.\c\nI hope we're together even at the end\nof all things.
I may be a Backpacker, but I'm also\na Treasure Hunter!\c
I missed my chance for that elusive\ntreasure called “victory"!
Have you heard of the Magma Stone?\c\nThey say it lies in a volcano somewhere\nand has something to do with Pokémon.\c\nYou put it somewhere...or remove it from\nsomewhere...and it'll summon\r\nsome Pokémon.\r\nNo one's that clear on the details.
Let's train!\nWe'll get stronger with our Pokémon!\c\nThen we can challenge the Gyms in places\nlike Opelucid City and Humilau City!\c
Not yet! I still haven't shared my true\nstrength with you!
My Pokémon are really, really important\nto me.\c\nThey've always been by my side to see my\nsmiles of joy and tears of frustration!
I'm the Treasure Hunter pretending to be\na Backpacker!\c
I missed my chance for that elusive\ntreasure called “victory"!

Not yet! I still haven't shared my true\nstrength with you!
My Pokémon are like my really important\nbrothers and sisters.\c\nEver since I was born, they've been with\nme, sharing my smiles and tears!
Hear the cry of my heart!\c\n“Everyone, SIT DOWN and SHUT UP!"\c
Hah... Hah... Hah... I feel a bit better now\nthat I've let that out.
I like kids and Pokémon both, but I'm\njust not that nice!
Hey, you!\nYou're gonna lose and cry!\c
...Grrr!
That's it! I'm gonna become Champion, and\nthen I'll blow you outta the water!
...You look tough.\c\nAll right! My Pokémon are burning for\na fight against a tough opponent!\c
Arg!\nI wasn't able to give good orders.
What do you think would happen if we had\nour Pokémon fight without any orders?
Ta-da!\nHere's my cute Pokémon!\c
Oh maaan!
...It's OK. My precious Pokémon will\nmake me feel better when we get home.
Come on! More!\nBring out your Pokémon's power!
I'm more psyched than I've ever been!\nI can still go on!
So this is what it means to draw forth the\npower hidden in your Pokémon!
I just won a battle back there, so I'm\nfeeling good!\c
Oh, whatever!\nI'm in a terrible mood now!
I think I'm gonna go to bed...\c\nI'm not enough of a man to be able\nto get right back up and try again.
And I was so excited, too...
The pain of my Pokémon...\nI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\nmy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\nNo! We can fight on!!
Phew...\nI gave it everything I had, but still...\r\nI just couldn't win...\c\nThanks, though!\nWe're going to keep aiming higher!
Come! Satisfy my urge to battle!
Marvelous! I shall believe in my Pokémon!
If-if I'd believed more, could I have\ndrawn out my Pokémon's power?
The bonds between us... Does the fact that\nwe can't see them make them more real?
If that is the move you chose\nafter serious consideration, that's fine!
Woooo! Your inexhaustible fighting spirit!\nImpressive!
Good! That strength is good!\nBut I'm going to send it back at you!
After the battle, a fresh wind\nblew through my heart...
Ah... I see...\nThat was quite well thought out.
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.\nJust kidding!
Ugh!\nI can't take much more of this...
Phew! I'll at least let my Pokémon take\nit easy on their days off!
To have a chance to battle with such\nstrong Pokémon...it was worth the wait!
The world is wide, and the road to glory\nis full of challenges!
Amazing! So that's what a Pokémon\nfrom the city is like!
Thanks for playing with me\nwhile my parents are busy!
Amazing...\nPlease, take me away with you!
What great Pokémon you have!\nThanks so much! I had a great time!
Impressive display!\n...Shall we break for tea?
Ahhh, that was fun!\nBut now I've got to get back to cleaning!
Huhhh?!\nWhat happened, Excadrill?
Huhhh?!\nWhat happened, Hippowdon?
Oh! Plasmaaaa!\nGlory to Team Plasma!
Plasmaaaa!\nWhat a pesky little kid!
The pain of my Pokémon...\nI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\nmy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\nNo! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...\nI did my best, but we lost...
The pain of my Pokémon...\nI feel it, too!
I'll hone my mind and become one with\nmy Pokémon!
No! Not yet!\nNo! We can fight on!!
Phew...\nI gave it everything I had, but still...\r\nI just couldn't win...\c\nThanks, though!\nWe're going to keep aiming higher!
Knave!\nI do ambush thee!\c
W-woe is me...
If that be the case then... Farewell!\nForgive me!
Oh-ho-ho!\nYou've been ambushed!\c
I lost!\nNo! Plasmaaaa!
Lose! J-just go and lose already!\nA kid like you should definitely lose!
Stupid intruders!\nI'm gonna blast you into space!\c
But...aren't I one of Team Plasma's stars?
First Team Galactic fell apart...\c\nThen I come all the way to Unova to join\nTeam Plasma, and now you!
What's this? You think you can beat me,\nthe one they call queen of Team Plasma?\c
Your face...it really drives me mad!
See, I'm going to take over the world and\nthen make that idiot N pay!\c\nThat traitor...\nJust his face makes me so mad!
If Team Plasma takes over the world,\nthere should be fewer Pokémon injured.\c
Grr... Tell me! Please!\nJust what is a Pokémon battle?!
Injured Pokémon have both enemies\nand friends!\c
Don't you think there will be less war if\nTeam Plasma takes over the world?
Hey there!\nHave you seen any intruders?\c\nWait, you're not...?!\c
What an audacious Trainer you are, to waltz\nright into our Plasma Frigate!
Tremble in the face of the skill that\nmade this Plasma Frigate! Then leave!
You people! Don't get cocky just because\nyou've got Pokémon!\c\nWe've got Pokémon, too!\nPokémon that we've stolen from all over!\c
What makes your Pokémon so different\nfrom mine?
What is this! Who would come after us with\nonly two people?!
You're getting annoyed by the Plasma\nFrigate's gimmicks, aren't you?\c
Arghhhh!\nI'm so super annoyed!
We spent so much money on all the Plasma\nFrigate's gimmicks that we've none left!\r\nAll we get to eat every day is bread!
I'm the fighting sweeper!\nI'll clean up garbage like you!\c
Oops...
The fact that I let you sneak in here\nmeans I'll probably lose my Pokémon, huh?\c\nThe Pokémon we stole with that plan two\nyears ago are running out, after all.
I am the one they call the Liepard of\nTeam Plasma!\c\nI will defeat you without getting a single\nscratch on me!\c
You are 100 percent perfect intruders!
See, I'm going to take over the world and\nthen make that idiot N pay!\c\nThat traitor...\nJust his face makes me so mad!
I'm going to go ahead and say it:\nPlasmaaaa!!\c
Do-over!\nCome on, let me have a do-over!
Pokémon are like our puppets!\c\nThey are bound by their Poké Balls and\ncontrolled by our orders!
This is our place! We aren't going to\nlet anyone mess with it!\c
Ahhhh! The floor is covered in mud after all\nthat fighting!
There are people who can't live anywhere\nbut here! You got a problem with that?!
Come! Satisfy my urge to battle!
Marvelous! I shall believe in my Pokémon!
If-if I'd believed more, could I have drawn\nout my Pokémon's power?
The bonds between us... Does the fact that\nwe can't see them make them more real?

Hi there!\c
How are things going with the Pokédex?\c\nSorry, I can't help but ask.\nBe sure to enjoy your journey, though!\c
You get more detailed information\nin the Pokédex by catching Pokémon!\c
Filling up pages in the Pokédex\nis very important, but don't forget...\c\nInteracting with Pokémon is a hundred--\neven a thousand--times more important!\c
I'm working with Pokémon Professors\nfrom other regions and trying to solve\r\nthe mysteries of Pokémon.\c\nEven with their help,\nwe can't find every answer.\c\nBut, if we learn things little by little,\nit may leave clues for the researchers\r\nwho follow us.\c
What can I do to improve the\nPokédex that will make everyone happy?\c
Looking at you reminds me of when\nI was a Backpacker, and it really\r\nmotivates me!\c\nThat's right! I also traveled the\nUnova region with a Pokédex!\c
I met your mother\nwhen I was a Backpacker!\c\nWe got to talking at the\ncounter in the Pokémon Center,\r\nand a huge line formed behind me!\c
I'm sure there are still Pokémon\nthat no one in the world has seen!\c\nDoesn't just imagining them make\nyou excited?\c
Dream big!\c\nI want to see every\nPokémon in the world!\c
In order to get along with others,\nyou must be understanding and accepting.\c\nI mean, Pokémon and people live\nby different rules!\c\nIf we just push our expectations on them,\nthere's no way it will go well.\c
OK, then! Take care.\nBye-bye!\c
Yeah?\c
You have to protect what's important\nto you on your own!\c
People who are strong in Pokémon\nbattles aren't automatically right.\c\nBut losers don't even have a leg\nto stand on, know what I mean?\c
When it's night\nand everything's quiet...\c\nIf you listen carefully,\nyou can hear the footsteps of Pokémon.\c\nI really like that.\c
If you believe in yourself\nand have Pokémon by your side,\r\neven being lost is fun!\c
I'm thinking about what Pokémon\nI should have to make up for\r\nmy other Pokémon's weaknesses.\c
I don't care what the reason is.\nIf you take other people's stuff,\r\nyou're nothing more than a dirty thief!\c
I like spending time thinking\nabout how to raise my Pokémon\r\nand make them stronger.\c
I guess if I had to pick a trait I prefer,\nI like Pokémon that are fast...\c
Hey, sorry!\nThere's something I want to do right now!\c
Um...\nI don't have much to say right now.\c
See ya!\c
Where am I now?\c\nI'm searching every corner of\nCastelia City for Team Plasma!\c\nYou haven't found them either, right?\nWe HAVE to find them!\c\nGot it?!\c
The sewers, huh...\c\nIf Team Plasma's hiding there,\nwe have to find them.\c\nOtherwise, I'm sure they'll cause trouble\nfor the Pokémon living there.\c
Thanks for helping back there!\c\nI'm going to keep looking for\nTeam Plasma in Castelia City.\c\nWhy don't you head to the Pokémon Gym?\c
You won the Insect Badge from\nthe Castelia City Pokémon Gym?\c\nWell then, you should go to\nNimbasa City and take on\r\nthe Gym Leader there!\c
What do you want?\c\nHave you challenged the\nDriftveil City Pokémon Gym yet?\c\nIf you haven't yet, just go already!\c\nHey, apparently the Gym Leader\nuses Ground-type Pokémon!\c
Clay just told you to participate\nin the Driftveil Tournament, right?\c\nI hear the tournament takes place\nto the south of Driftveil City!\c
The Pokémon World Tournament!\c\nA Trainer who wins on the first try\nmust be really good!\c
No matter what kind of tournament\nit is, winning's impressive!\c
It's Team Plasma!\c\nThere's a suspicious-looking ship\ndocked in the area south of the\r\nPokémon World Tournament arena!\c\nMeet me there!\c
Hey, how nice!\nWe're having a nice friendly chat!\r\nAt a time like this...\c\nGet off the Xtransceiver already!\c
Actually...\c\nYou're strong enough that\nyou can probably even beat\r\nMistralton City's Gym Leader.\c\nWell, I've already won my\nJet Badge, though!\c
I've got one word for you...\c\nReversal Mountain.\c\nOh, wait, that's two words...\c
Are you somewhere near Undella Town now?\c\nMaybe I'll go there and battle with you.\c\nIt's been a while!\c
Opelucid City's Gym Leader\nwas really tough!\c
Good! You're OK!\c\nI'm in Humilau City,\nso I can't get there right away,\r\nbut I'm sure you can handle it!\c
I'm looking for Team Plasma,\nbut I can't find a trace of them!\c\nGo to Humilau City.\nThe Gym Leader's named Marlon.\r\nHurry up and go beat him!\c
Didn't I just tell you?!\c\nLet's split up and look\nfor the Plasma Frigate!\r\nYou check Route 22!\c
...\c\nWhy would you think this would be a good\ntime to chat on the Xtransceiver?!\c
The Pokémon League is\njust past Victory Road.\c\nVictory Road itself is\njust beyond Route 23!\c
Hm... So you're on\nVictory Road.\c\nThen you're almost to the\nPokémon League!\c
Don't worry about me!\c\nYou're at the Pokémon League, right?\nThe only thing you need to think about\r\nis winning!\c
I'm in Undella Town.\nIf you're bored, come hang out.\c
I'm in Driftveil City.\c\nIf you have time, head over.\nI'll spar with you.\c
I'm still in Driftveil City.\c\nYou can just do what you want\nto do, you know?\c
                                                                
                                                                             
                                                                        
                                                                                                       
                                                                   
                                                                                           
                                                                        
                                                                                         
                                              
                                                  
                                                       
How're things going over there?\c\n...\c\nReally...\nGive me a hand, then!\c\nGo check out Seaside Cave!\nThat's right! The one on Route 21!\c\nOK! Counting on you!\c
We're heading down into the Giant Chasm!\nI'm not letting Team Plasma get away!\c
You know the next Pokémon Gym\nafter Nimbasa City is Driftveil City, right?\c
Leave it to me! I won't let Team Plasma\nescape from Nimbasa City!\c
You were a big help back there!\nGuess Driftveil City's next!\c
There was one more Team Plasma member.\nHey, go listen to what he has to say!\c
Brilliant!\nNice work getting the Gym Badge!\c
It's just a rumor, but I heard\nTeam Plasma was in Lacunosa Town...\c
Huh! You even beat Drayden!\nYou're really something!\c
Have you beat Marlon yet?\nDon't keep me waiting too long!\c
They were headed for the\nGiant Chasm, weren't they?\c
Come to the sewers!\nLet's look for Team Plasma!\c
OK! Got it!\nWaiting in the sewer isn't fun!\c
You know Celestial Tower?\c\nIt's on Route 7!\nGo train there if you want!\c
It's OK! I won't let Team Plasma\nescape from Lacunosa Town!\c\nSo do whatever you need to prepare!\c
I don't mean to brag...\c\nBut I'm not such a\nbad Trainer myself!\c\nAnd you're even better!\c\nAll right! Go and knock around\nthose chumps at the Pokémon League!\c
Oh yeah! I'll come meet you. There's\nsomething I want to talk to you about.\c
Did you like amusement parks?\nI forget...\c
What's up?\c
Listen...\c\nMake sure you never run out\nof Poké Balls!\c\nYou never know where you'll\nrun into what Pokémon!\c\nYou have to be ready and believe\nan opportunity will come your way!\c
The only real defeat in\nPokémon battling is giving up.\c\nIf you think about why you lost\nand compensate for it,\r\nthe next time you face a challenge,\r\nyou'll improve yourself.\c\nBut if you don't do anything,\nthere's no way you'll win.\c
Hmm...\c\nIt's important to teach people\nmany things about Pokémon,\r\nbut what I really want people to know\r\nis that being with Pokémon is fun!\c
Truths...\nIdeals...\c\nThere are as many of these as there\nare people...\c\nI'm sure there are even as many\nas there are people and\r\nPokémon together.\c\nThat's why you can always say\nthere must be right answers somewhere.\c
I stopped wearing glasses,\nand Bianca is wearing glasses now...\c\nI hadn't seen her in a long time,\nand I was sure surprised when I saw that.\c
When I was a kid,\nI did an experiment where I\r\nwore a blindfold all of the time.\c\nI thought by doing that...\nI could train my senses.\c
Don't you think it's strange that a guy\nlike me is a Gym Leader!\c\nOh!\nI'm sorry.\c\nDidn't mean to put you\nin an awkward position there.\c
When you don't have self-confidence,\nit's easy to want to fall back on\r\na title like “Champion" or something,\r\nbut that's really superficial.\c
Even if you have knowledge,\nyou have to have wisdom as well.\c\nKnowledge is mere information.\nNow, understanding how to use it,\r\nthat is what's really important.\c
You have to check out what you're\ninterested in and confirm it for yourself.\c\nIf you only try to understand\neverything on an intellectual level,\r\nyou're gonna run into a lot of trouble.\c
Be seeing you.\c
Hellooo!\c
How are things going today?\c\nIf everything is going well,\nI'm sure you're having fun!\c\nIf it's not great, then I'm\nsure tomorrow will be better!\c
Walking into the tall grass\nto go look for Pokémon\r\nnever gets old!\c\nI will never forget how\nthat feels as long as I live!\c
I've been reading a ton of books\nwhile helping Professor Juniper,\r\nso I started wearing glasses!\c\nI think they look pretty good\non me!\c
So when you buy 10 Poké Balls\nat one time...\c\nA-MAZ-ing-ly!\nYou get a Premier Ball as well!\c\nIsn't that fantastic?!\c
Know what? This just popped into my head,\nbut a friend is always a friend,\r\neven when you can't see each\r\nother for a long time!\c
Hm... I just remembered something\nthat happened in the past.\c\nWell actually, it isn't really the past,\nit was more something that happened\r\nreally recently, I guess.\c\nI'm talking about when I got my Pokémon\nand the Pokédex and went on my journey!\c
Hey!\c\nWould it make you happy if\nPokémon could talk?\r\nOr would it cause you problems?\c\nI'm always talking to my Pokémon,\nbut I wonder what I would do\r\nif they actually replied...\c
The most mysterious thing\nabout Pokémon...\r\nis that they stay with people!\c\nI'm thinking about making that\nthe theme of my research.\c
So, I've just started my research\ninto Pokémon.\r\nActually, I'm still just an assistant.\c\nBut it's probably impossible to\nunderstand everything about Pokémon.\c\nProfessors know this but still continue\ntheir research.\r\nI find that astonishing...\c
...\c\nOh! I'm sorry!\c\nA Pokémon I'm interested\nin just popped out!\c
See you!\c
Oh!\nYou sound full of energy!\c
Did you find more Pokémon\nto travel with you?\c\nJourneys are definitely more\nfun when they're lively!\c
Hmm, I wonder what I should\ndo for dinner tonight...\c
There are many different Pokémon,\nand even the same kind of Pokémon\r\nhave individuals with completely\r\ndifferent Natures!\c\nI wonder what kind of Pokémon is a\nperfect match for you.\c
The first thing you need to do to\ngain a Pokémon's trust is walk with them!\c\nBy doing that, they will come to\nknow a lot about you!\c
Don't worry about the house.\c\nThe sheets on your bed will be clean\nand washed so they're ready whenever\r\nyou come home!\c
If I can be serious for a moment...\c\nPokémon have existed since\nbefore you were born, right?\c\nYou've never thought to question\nwhy they're there, right?\c\nBut isn't questioning what you know\nan important part of being on a journey?\c
Pokémon Center receptionists remember\nTrainers better than you might expect.\c\nOf course, they remember the\nPokémon that were with them, too!\c
Have you caught lots of Pokémon?\c\nOK, but be sure to have a look at your\nPC Boxes in the Pokémon Center.\c\nMaybe there's a Pokémon in there\nwho wants to travel with you!\c
The Pokémon Center is\neveryone's home!\c\nYou should just make yourself\nat home like you belong there!\c
Do you have enough money?\c\nI just thought I should ask,\nbut a sensible kid like you is OK!\c\nStill, don't waste your money!\nYou might not have it when you need it!\c
OK!\nTake care of yourself!\c
Hello!\nIs this [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\n...\c
...Hello!\c
Hello!\c
Hello?\c
...Hello?\c\nAh, it must be [VAR 0100(0000)], right?

Rock is great!\nI was listening to music just now!\c\nMusic is wonderful!\nIt gives me energy!\c\nI wonder what your favorite music is.\nOops!\c\nMy colleague is calling me.\nI have to get back to work!\c
Guess what!\n[VAR 010F(0001)] Pokémon are\r\nquite popular among many of my friends!\c\n...\c\nReally?\c\n[VAR 010F(0001)] Pokémon happen\nto be your favorite, too? That's great!\c\nOops!\c\nMy colleague is calling me.\nI have to get back to work!\c
Guess what!\nCool Pokémon are quite popular among\r\nmany of my friends!\c\nI would feel great if you liked\ncool Pokémon, too!\c\nIt'll mean coolness is the\n“in" thing, you know!\c\nOops!\c\nMy colleague is calling me.\nI have to get back to work!\c
[VAR 010F(0001)], for me,\nis a good way to spend the holiday!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\nhow do you spend your... Oh!\c\nHow rude of me to ask such a question\nof a lady!\c\nOops!\c\nMy colleague is calling me.\nI have to get back to work!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)], what will you do on\nyour holiday... Oops!\c\nHow rude of me to ask such a question\nof a lady!\c\nI'm usually at work, unfortunately.\nThat's why I still haven't picked up\r\nmy Xtransceiver from you...\c\nOops!\c\nMy colleague is calling me.\nI have to get back to work!\c
You know what I had a chance to\ndo recently?\r\n[VAR 010F(0001)]!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], how about you?\n[VAR 010F(0001)]s?\c\nOops!\c\nMy colleague is calling me.\nI have to get back to work!\c
What comes to your mind when you hear the\nidea of communication through Pokémon?\c\nTrades or battles?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\nI'd like a trade with you\r\nif you like to trade Pokémon!\c\nOops!\c\nMy colleague is calling me.\nI have to get back to work!\c

Actually, I'm off work today!\c\nI'd like to pick up my Xtransceiver.\nThe one you've been keeping for me!\c\nWill you please come to the Ferris wheel\nin Nimbasa City?\c\nOh, if you can, of course!\c\nSee you there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c
Thank you so much for the other day!\c\nI was surprised you were my age!\nI was guessing you would be older\r\nthan me by your voice.\c\nIt made me a little nervous\non the Xtransceiver, you know?\c\nI'm relieved that I can relax\nfrom now on when we talk.\c\nI should get back to work now.\nTalk to you later, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c

I may have said this before, but\nI like Electric-type Pokémon a lot!\c\nWhen they give off electricity,\nI feel like I'm energized!\c\nDon't you agree they have that\nkind of charm?\c\nBesides, there are so many cool Pokémon\namong them!\c\nI should get back to work now.\nTalk to you later, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c

The stars last night were\nso beautiful...\c\nDid you see them by any chance,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI saw lots of shooting stars, too.\nIt really was a pretty night.\c\nI saw so many that I made\nmany wishes.\c\nWhat?\c\nAhaha!\c\nI can't tell you what I wished for...\c\n...\c\nOops!\c\nI better get back to work!\c

I was using the Dowsing Machine the other\nday and got something really awesome.\c\nI gave it to my dad, and he was\nreally pleased.\c\nI'm glad you told me about the\nDowsing Machine a while ago,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\n...\c\nOops!\c\nI better get back to work!\c
Oh!\c\nSorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt's almost time for work...\c\nI have to hang up...\c\nSo sorry...\c
I'm on my break right now.\nCouldn't help answering\r\n'cause I wanted to talk to you!\c\nIt's voice only, sorry!\c\nAhaha!\c\n...\c\nMy job keeps me busy, and\nI was just about to collapse...\c\nBut hearing your voice is\ngiving me energy, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nOops!\c\nMy break is over.\nI have to go back to work.\c\nNext time, I want to be looking at\nyour face while we talk.\c
I found a nice walking spot\nwith a wonderful view the other day.\c\nThat spot may look totally\ndifferent depending on the season.\c\nMaybe we could go for a walk together\nsometime soon...\c\n...\c\nOops!\nI have to get back to work.\c
I found this shop that bakes really\ngood cakes the other day.\c\nThey bake things that taste mysterious.\nI've never tasted anything like them.\c\nMaybe we could go there together\nsometime soon...\c\n...\c\nOops!\nI have to get back to work.\c
I was just thinking about you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\n...What did I just say?\c\n...\c\nAhaha!\c\nEr...\nWell... I have to go back to work now.\c
I've been too busy and\nsleep deprived lately.\c\nIf it wasn't you I was talking to,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nI'd have fallen asleep by now.\c\nAhaha!\c\n...\c\nOops!\nI have to get back to work.\c
The weather is bearable today, isn't it?\c\nI'd go for a walk if not for my work...\c\nBut I'm OK for now, because\nI got to talk to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nTee hee!\c\n...\c\nOops!\nI have to get back to work.\c

Stop that!\c\nHey!\c\nSigh...\c\nSorry...\c\nThat was my sister and brother\nbothering me...\c\nThey seem to get jealous\nwhen I talk to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAhaha!\c\nThey are usually bratty, but I guess\nthey can be cute sometimes.\c\nArg! Hey, I said “stop"!\c\nSigh...\c\nSorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt seems that I have to spend time with\r\nthem today...\c
Cough, cough.\c\nSorry...\nI got a cold, it seems...\c\n...\c\nYeah...\nI'm really sorry. Cough... I guess so.\c\nI'll stay home\nand rest for now.\c\nBut...\nSeeing your face should help\r\nme recover sooner, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAhaha!\c
I bought a Soda Pop from this\nvending machine the other day.\c\nGuess what!\c\nI got an extra as a bonus.\c\nIt's great, isn't it?\nHave you got a bonus before, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI would have shared it with you,\nhad we been together then...\c\nOops!\nI have to get back to work.\c
Oh, sorry I've kept you wai...\nUh-oh.

Wow, Nuvema Town?\c\nYou must be going to the\nJuniper Pokémon Lab then, right?\c\nOr could you be going to\nvisit my friend's house?\c
Accumula Town!\c\nI remember hearing the pretty sound\nof someone playing an instrument there.\c
I recommend the restaurant\nin Striaton City!\c\nIt's run by former Gym Leaders,\nso I'm sure it's amazing!\c
I really like Nacrene City's warehouses,\nespecially Café Warehouse!\c\nBut, actually, the place you absolutely\nmust visit is the Nacrene Museum.\c
Castelia City!\nThere's just too much to see there!\c\nYou might want to participate\nin the Castelia Harlequin Hunt!\c\nThat's a great way to see the sights.\c\nOther than that...\nTry exploring on your own!\c\nExploring is one of the most fun\nthings about arriving in a new city!\c
Nimbasa City is the city of entertainment!\c\nWorking at the Pokémon Center\nthere was sure a lot of fun.\c\nWell, now...\c\nBig Stadium and Small Court are\npacked with tough Trainers.\c\nThere are so many other things\nto see and do! Enjoy yourself!\c
Driftveil City!\c\nRecently, hotels have been\npopping up there like crazy, so I hear.\c\nBoy, other than that, I sure\ndon't know much about it!\c
Mistralton City always makes me\nthink of Skyla!\c\nPeople who had been hurt by\nthe device in her Pokémon Gym\r\nwould come to the Pokémon Center.\c
Icirrus City, huh...\c\nThe way the seasons change there is nice.\nI particularly like how it looks in winter.\c
Opelucid City!\nThat's a great city!\c\nI heard that the mayor, Drayden,\ncan teach an amazing Dragon-type move!\c
Route 1...\nUm, now, what was there?\c\nOh, that's right! Using Surf will\ntake you to an unexpected place!\c
Route 2, eh...\c\nI vaguely remember there being\nsome ledges on that route!\c
The Day Care is on Route 3.\c\nThere's a preschool there too, right?\c\nAnd what was that other place called?\nWellspring Cave, was it?\c\nIt's on that same route.\c
Wow! Route 4!\nAlways a lot going on over there.\c\nThings like construction and\npeople finding ruins.\c
I used to slip out of the\nPokémon Center from time to time\r\nand go watch the performers on Route 5.\c\nWhile I was there, I met many people,\nsuch as a girl who would buy items.\c
Did you visit the Season Research Lab\non Route 6?\r\nAlso, wasn't there a cave around there?\c\nAnd... Oh, yes. Watch out!\nYou might get fooled by something!\c
Route 7 has those raised walkways.\nIf you stop, you fall right off!\c\nAlso, I seem to remember an unexpected\nPokémon popping out of the tall grass.\c
Route 8's puddles freeze in winter.\nI liked how you could slide on them, but it\r\nwas a bit hard to make forward progress!\c
Route 9, huh.\c\nThe toughs that hang out there might\nchallenge you to a Pokémon battle.\c\nBut you're a tough Trainer yourself,\nso that works out great for you!\c
Ah, I liked Route 10.\nThere was something lyrical about it...
Route 11 is just like Route 14.\nWaterfall time!\c
Route 12's gently sloping hills\nroll up and down, up and down.\c\nStrolling across them is a nice feeling!\c
My impression of Route 13\nis that it's rather long!\c\nI remember the main route's\nbeing hard to find, but it's nice\r\nbecause you can go many places!\c
You're on Route 14?\nThen...use Waterfall, right?!\c
Wow, Route 15...\c\nThe highlight is the\nPoké Transfer Lab.\c\nAnd I think there was a lady there\nwho would trade Pokémon.\c\nHmm... Could I have misremembered?\c
Route 16, huh...\c\nYou sure don't expect to find\na forest like that so close to\r\nNimbasa City, do you?\c\nI wonder what the Lostlorn\nForest is like these days.\c
Route 17, is it?\c\nThe current was so fast,\nI couldn't go where I wanted...\c
Route 18!\c\nThe most interesting thing about it...\c\nWhat could it be?\c
The Dreamyard...\c\nI've heard that rarely seen\nPokémon go there.\c\nA mysterious power remains\nthat draws them there.\c
Bug-type Pokémon can\nbe found all over Pinwheel Forest.\c\nBy the way, it never bugs me to\nsee Bug-type Pokémon!\c
Watch out for sandstorms\nin the Desert Resort!\c\nSome types of Pokémon\nwill take constant damage in them!\c
The Relic Castle, you say?\nYou'll get buried in sand!\c\nYou already know this, right?\c\nIf you run onto pits in the sand,\nyou'll fall through them!\c
The Pokémon World Tournament?\nOh, so you are in Driftveil.\c\nWhat are you going to do?\nDid you enter the tournament?\c\nI'll be cheering for you on TV!\c
What's this? I'm hearing a buzzing noise.\c\nWhat? Chargestone Cave?\c\nWow! The Xtransceiver works in there?\nI never knew that!\c
I'm having a hard time hearing you...\c\nTwist Mountain?\c\nOh, now I see!\nYou're in Clay's mountain, then.\c\nI've heard you can find Fossils there!\c
Dragonspiral Tower!\nWow! You can go inside?\c\nIsn't that the place where they say the\nlegendary Pokémon is resting?\c
Victory Road!\nThe road that puts you to the test!\c\nYou'll be fine! You've got\nPokémon by your side!\c
Lacunosa Town... Oh, my word.\c\nWhat made an impression on me when\nI visited that town was that it was\r\ncompletely different from day to night.\c
Undella Town, Undella Town.\c\nA very rich family used to live there,\nbut it looks like everyone moved.\c\nI hear the Marine Tube\nis totally amazing!\c
Anville Town!\c\nWhat?\nWere you a big fan of trains?\c\nStill, I understand how you feel.\c
The Pokémon League!\c\nOh, my goodness!\c\nSo, you just have to challenge\nthe Elite Four, and then...\c\nBelieve in your Pokémon\nand move forward!\c
Pardon me? Where?\c\nN's Castle?\c\nI'm sorry...\nI've never heard of it.\c
The Royal Unova?\c\nA cruise ship from Castelia!\nYou're getting pretty fancy!\c\nSo, which is it going to be?\nAre you going to have fun battling...\r\nor enjoy the sights?\c
Gear Station, then?\c\nThe trains to Anville Town get overlooked\nmore often than you'd expect!\c\nIf you have time, you should take a ride!\c
Battle Subway!\nYou sure like challenges.\c\nKeeping a winning streak\ngoing is really hard.\c\nBut the knowledge and experience you\ngain from battle will make you stronger!\c
Musical Theater!\nHee hee hee!\c\nI used to go there often, too!\nI only went to watch, though!\c\nThe Pokémon look so cute\nwith their accessories and dancing!\c
Black City, huh?\nI wonder how it has changed.\c
White Forest, huh?\nI wonder how it has changed.\c
Unity Tower!\c\nIf you've traded Pokémon\nwith people from other countries,\r\nyou should definitely visit!\c
Wellspring Cave...\c\nIt's small, but exploring deep within\nthe cave is surprisingly difficult.\c
Mistralton Cave, huh?\c\nMany Trainers go there\nto catch a Pokémon called Axew!\c
Rumination Field?\c\nOh, yes!\nDeep in Pinwheel Forest, as I remember.\c\nNow, what are you doing in a\nplace like that?\c
The Celestial Tower...\nA final resting place for Pokémon.\c\nI'm sure some kind soul will\nring the bell today.\c
Moor of Icirrus...\c\nMoor of Icirrus...\c\nWhat is it?\c\nI've heard of it,\nbut I've never been there...\c
A Shopping Mall?\c\nHm. Now, I wonder why the first thing\nthat came to mind was the storeroom!\c
         
The Poké Transfer Lab!\c\nHelping Professor Park\nis a lot of fun, isn't it?\c
The Giant Chasm?\c\nWhere is that?\nWhere the meteor fell?\c\nWhat? Is that not it?\c\nI think I heard something like that\nfrom Professor Juniper once, though...\c
Where are you now?\c\nIn Liberty Garden?\c\nTwo years ago, it became really famous\nwhen a mythical Pokémon was found there!\c
P2 Laboratory?\nI don't know much about that.\c\nCould that be the lab on Route 17?\c
The Skyarrow Bridge is sure amazing.\c\nWhen I saw that the first time...\c\nThat's right, saw it, not crossed it.\c\nI guess, at the time,\nI was just astonished.\c
The Driftveil Drawbridge, eh?\c\nI've always wanted to see the\nbridge opening and closing.\c
Did you feel the vibrations of the Tubeline\nBridge on the bottom of your feet?\c\nIt feels like those vibrations give you\nenergy. I just love that feeling!\c
Recently, the Village Bridge\nhas changed a bit, and there are\r\nthings like tennis courts there.\c\nThere's no Pokémon Center, though.\nI haven't really gotten used to it yet.\c
The Marvelous Bridge has\na futuristic design.\c\nBut I've heard rumors of a ghost there...\c
Entralink?\c\nI don't know about that...\c\nIs there a place like that\nin the Unova region?\c
Now, hm, the Abundant Shrine?\c\nThe shrine honors the weather Pokémon\nthat is said to watch over harvests...\c
Undella Bay is a famous place to dive!\c\nAnd, on the bottom of the sea...\nWell, you should see for yourself!\c
Lostlorn Forest?\c\nI think it may have been the work\nof a Pokémon...\c
The Trial Chamber?\c\nA Trainer might have told\nme about it a long time ago.\c\nWas it the little room on\nVictory Road?\c
The Guidance Chamber...\c\nOh, I remember!\c\nWasn't it in the deepest\npart of Mistralton Cave?\c\nSome people think it's a place\nwhere hard-to-find Pokémon live.\c
Entree Forest?\c\nI'm not familiar with it, I'm afraid.\c\nYou say there's a place like that\nin the Unova region?\c
Nimbasa City is the city of entertainment!\c\nWorking at the Pokémon Center\nthere was sure a lot of fun.\c\nWell, now...\c\nBig Stadium and Small Court are\npacked with tough Trainers.\c\nThere are so many other things\nto see and do! Enjoy yourself!\c

Undella Town, Undella Town.\c\nA very rich family used to live there,\nbut it looks like everyone moved.\c\nNow there are fewer manors there.\nIt's a little sad.\c
Accumula Gate is, um, well...\c\nUmmm...\c\nDoes anything make it different\nfrom any other gate?\c
Undella Gate is a vertical gate.\c\nThe fact that it's not really different\nfrom a horizontal gate is one of\r\nthe great things about gates!\c
Nacrene Gate is a very gate-y gate!\c\nUnless you're super obsessed with gates,\nyou can't tell the difference, though.\c
Castelia Gate, huh?\c\nThe gap between Castelia City and\nRoute 4 is pretty fun, isn't it?\c
The Nimbasa Gates, you say?\c\nFor some odd reason,\nI like the one on the right!\c
Opelucid Gate, really? Er...\c\nI seem to remember a man who\nwas always eating something\r\nby one of those gates.\c
Black Gate!\c\nPass on through, pass on through\nto the expansive Black City!\c\nSo... Yeah...\nThere isn't a ton to say about gates.\c
White Gate!\c\nPass on through, pass on through\nto the expansive White Forest!\c\nSo... Yeah...\nThere isn't a ton to say about gates.\c
A Bridge Gate?\c\nAll of the gates connected to\nbridges in the Unova Region\r\nare...all...called...Bridge Gates!\c
Route Gate?\c\nHee hee. There are two gates\ncalled Route Gates.\c\nThe first one is off Route 1, and the\nother is close to the Desert Resort!\c
The Abyssal Ruins!\c\nA mysterious, ancient script!\c\nAnd if you solve its secret,\nplease tell me what it is!\c
What?\nYou're in Aspertia?!\c\nThen you should come home!\nTo your own house!\c
Virbank City!\c\nYou went to a music club?\c\nRecently, I've been getting into\nRoxie's band!\c\nWhen I listen to them,\nI feel so full of energy!\c
Oh my! You're in Humilau City?\c\nThat's the nicest of all the resort areas\nin the Unova region!\c\nI was only at the Pokémon Center\nin that town for a short while.\c
Pokéstar Studios!\c\nWhat?! You're going to\nbe in a movie?\r\nWell, I'll have to go see it!\c\nOh, a little advice--acting\nis all about being natural!\c
You're in Join Avenue?\c\nI think the way the stores\ncome and go is romantic, somehow.\c
You're in Floccesy Town for a spell?\nDid you visit Alder's house?\c\nA long time ago, Alder taught me about\nPokémon! Boy, that takes me back!\c
Lentimas Town is close to\nReversal Mountain.\c\nIt's small, but it has an air of uniqueness\nthat makes it surprisingly popular!\c
Route 19 is right outside of Aspertia.\c\nI guess you could say it's a valley road.\c
Route 20 is a place where you can\nenjoy the changing of the seasons.\c\nMy favorite season is fall!\nYou know, the foliage, the colors... Ah...\c
I guess you could say that Route 21\nis very rocky. It's like a maze.\c\nYou might find it surprisingly hard to\nmake progress!\c
Route 22 is very lush and green.\c\nSo that could well indicate that you'll\nfind many different Pokémon there.\c
Route 23, huh...\c\nIt's the last great natural\narea in the Unova region.\c\nApparently, the path is so steep\nand dangerous that some people\r\ngo on and on about it.\c
Castelia Sewers.\c\nThat's just another way to say it's\nCastelia City's sewer system.\c\nI'm sorry I can't help more.\nI know about it, but I've never been.\c\nBut, listen!\c\nI've heard there's a secret place\nlocated at the far end of the sewer!\c
The ranch!\c\nApparently, when I was little,\nI rode a Pokémon and\r\neveryone got really mad!\c\nBut I was just a little kid,\nand I don't remember that at all!\c
Virbank Complex?\nWhat, are you helping someone work?\c\nStill, I sure remember how\npretty it looked at night!\c
Reversal Mountain!\c\nSo many Trainers arrived at the\nPokémon Center completely wiped out!\c\nPlease be careful, OK?\c
The Strange House?!\c\nWow, I know that place!\c\nIt's a mysterious place close to\nReversal Mountain. Know where I mean?\c\nHmm. Maybe there are ghosts there...\c
Victory Road!\nThe road that puts you to the test!\c\nYou'll be fine! You've got\nPokémon by your side!\c
What?\nThe Plasma Frigate?\c\nNever heard of it.\c\nShould I go have a look\nand see what it's like?\c
Relic Passage...\c\nAs the name suggests, it's\nan underground passage built long ago.\c\nIf you pass through it, maybe you'll\nfind out who made it and why!\c
Clay Tunnel, huh?\c\nI heard Clay kept on digging\nno matter what.\c\nI wonder what it is about digging that\nis so captivating to some folks.\c\nI heard there is someone who loves\ndigging in the Sinnoh region as well.\c
          
The White Treehollow!\c\nThe so-called Unova's Challenge!\nHow far can you get?\c\nWith those Pokémon at your side,\nI'm sure you won't have any trouble!\c
The Black Tower!\c\nThe so-called Unova's Challenge!\nHow far can you get?\c\nWith those Pokémon at your side,\nI'm sure you won't have any trouble!\c
The Seaside Cave, so, so, so...\c\nAt some point, waves, wind, and Pokémon\nmade that cave in that giant rock.\c
The Cave of Being. Ah, yes, I recall it.\nI wonder what's in there.\c\nApparently, it's a strange\nplace with nothing inside.\c
A Hidden Grotto...?\c\nI have no idea what that is!\c\nHonestly, I'm not hiding anything!\c
Wow, the Marine Tube!\c\nIt was just finished recently, I think!\nIt's like a walk-through aquarium!\c\nI really want to go see it!\c
Virbank Gate, and...\c\nGates are pretty much the same\neverywhere, wouldn't you say?\c
Aspertia Gate is really close!\c\nWhat? If you want to rest,\nyou should just come home!\c
The Nature Preserve...?\nI've heard rumors about it, but...\c\nSince it exists to protect\nrare Pokémon, only certain\r\npeople are allowed to go there.\c\nReally? Have you been granted entry?!\c
Hee hee hee!\c\nSo the allure of gaining Medals\nhas you hooked too, huh?\c\nYou can learn a lot in the Medal Office!\c
What?\nThe Underground Ruins?\c\nI've never heard of such a place.\c\nShould I go take a peek and see what's\ngoing on there?\c
What?\nRock Peak Chamber?\c\nNever heard of it.\c\nShould I go have a look and find out\nwhat's up with it?\c
What?\nIceberg Chamber?\c\nNot familiar with it.\c\nShould I go have a look and see\nwhat's going on there?\c
What?\nIron Chamber?\c\nYou got me. No idea.\c\nShould I go have a look\nand check it out?\c
Pledge Grove?\c\nOh. The one in Floccesy Town!\c\nThe marks on that rock just\nhave to have been made by Pokémon!\c

I feel that if it's with you, this battle\nwon't be a simple competition\r\nbut a battle where I can ponder\r\nthe relationship between\r\nPokémon and their Trainers.\c
Do you want to show how strong you\nare by winning, or do you want to\r\nlearn what battling really means?\c\nPokémon battles have no meaning if\nyou don't think about why you battle.\c\nOr better said, it makes battling\ntogether with Pokémon meaningless.\c
Even if hurt, my Pokémon will fight\nfor me with just one command.\c\nI think you'll value and trust\nyour Pokémon more if you keep\r\nthat fact close to your heart.\c\nWhat can I do for these Pokémon?\nWhat should I do?\c\nThat's right! I battle with everything\nI have to find the ideal relationship\r\nbetween Pokémon and people!\c
Thank you!\c\nI feel like I saw a little of\nthe way toward my ideals.\c
Even when you lose, your Pokémon\nare still brimming with fighting spirit.\c
Cheren: I'll keep battling many Trainers\nand Pokémon like this, and if I can\r\nlearn what kind of person I am, it will\r\nopen up my path.\c\nI'm sure this path will lead me to become\nthe person I'm meant to be.\c\nPokémon will always be with you and me as\nwe go down our own paths.\c\nOur important friends, Pokémon...\c
Cheren: Pokémon are by all of our sides--\nmine, yours, and each and\r\nevery Trainer's!\c\nThat's why we move forward!\nThe Pokémon walking alongside us\r\ngive us the strength to do so!\c
In this corner, the young Pokémon\nTrainer battling for his ideals, Cheren!\c
Get ready! I'm gonna knock\nsome sense outta ya!\c
Fight with this Pokémon this way...\nUse this item that way...\r\nAre you letting others decide that\r\nfor you?\c\nWell, whatever, but what's important\nis figuring out what you want to do!\c\nGet ready! 'Cause I'm going to knock\nthe common sense outta you and drag\r\nyou into a brand new world!\c
You don't do anything!\nWhat do you know?!\c\nYou don't do anything!\nHow're you gonna change?!\c\nBut, I've got you covered!\nI'm gonna give your reason a\r\ntoxic shock and open up your mind!\c
Wild!\c\nYour reason's already\nmore toxic than mine!
Hey, c'mon! Get serious!\nYou gotta put more out there!\c
Roxie: You didn't win... I lost!\c\nI was weak and made my Pokémon\nfeel how much losing stinks!\c\nWatch out! Next time we meet,\nI'm going to give you a toxic shock!\c
Roxie: Ya can't win 'em all.\nIt's impossible, seriously!\c\nTrying to look cool every\ntime you mess up or fail\r\nis totally exhausting!\c\nSo you just have to\nlet it all hang out!\c
Toxic music and toxic words!\nShow 'em what you've got, Roxie!\c
Thanks again for your help.\c\nMy Bug-type Pokémon are scurrying with\nexcitement about getting to battle you.\r\nLet's get straight to it!\c
If the battle brings out the beauty in\nBug-type Pokémon, it will be a scene that\r\nmakes my heart flutter, win or lose.\c\nMy bug Pokémon are abuzz\nwith anticipation.\c\nLet's get straight to it!\c
M'hm...\c\nIf I win this battle,\nI feel like I can draw a\r\npicture unlike any before it.\c\nOK! I can hear my battle\nmuse loud and clear.\c\nLet's get straight to it!\c
Is it over?\nHas my muse abandoned me?\c
Wow...\nIt's beautiful somehow, isn't it...\c
Burgh: Aww...\nI lost.\c\nWhatever! Losing to you doesn't bug me,\nbecause you are a-MAZ-ingly strong!\c
Burgh: Sometimes I hear people\nsay something was an ugly win,\r\nbut I think if you're trying your best,\r\nany win is beautiful.\c
The premier insect artist!\nBurgh, your canvas is here!\c
My beloved Pokémon are going\nto make your head spin!\c
I am me, and Pokémon are Pokémon!\c\nI feel that strongly when I\nbattle with Pokémon moves,\r\nand that's why I do it.\c\nNow, my beloved Pokémon are\ngoing to make your head spin!\c
C'est fini!\c\nWhen I'm certain of that, I feel an\nelectric jolt run through my body!\c\nI want to feel that sensation, so\nnow my beloved Pokémon are\r\ngoing to make your head spin!\c
I meant to make your head spin,\nbut you shocked me instead.
That was unsatisfying somehow...\nWill you give it your all next time?\c
Elesa: My, oh my...\nYou have a sweet fighting style.\c
Elesa: You're a shining\nstar of a Trainer, but\r\nmy Pokémon shone brighter!\c
The shining beauty, the sparkling\nbolt of electricity, Elesa!\c
Yer tougher than ya were when\nI gave ya that Gym Badge, right?\c\nWell, how 'bout we have ourselves\na look and see what ya can do now.\c
How much stronger ya get comes\nfrom how much you want to win!\c\nAlways be loyal to that desire,\nya hear?\c
If ya want ta win,\ndon't make excuses! Got it?\c\nIf yer gonna bellyache,\njust forget 'bout fightin'!\c\nWell, I might be fussin' 'bout\nnothing when it comes to you.\c
Well, I've had enough... And just so you\nknow, I didn't go easy on you.
It's simple, hear!\nI wanted to win more than ya did!\c
Clay: Fer such a young 'un,\nya have an imposin' battle style.\c\nI wonder what kind a journey ya\nhad that made ya so strong.\c\nBut, I still don't like losin'!\c
Clay: What's important is\nhow ya react to losin'.\c\nThat's why folks who use losin'\nas fuel to get better are tough.\c
The underground boss, Clay!\nRising from the depths of the soil!\c
Why don't you and I have some fun?\c
What I like is having fun!\c\nI love doing things like flying\nin the sky with Pokémon\r\nand bringing out their best!\c\nSo, how about you and I\nhave some fun?\c
It's finally time for a showdown!\c\nThat means the Pokémon battle\nthat decides who's at the top, right?\c\nI love being on the summit!\n'Cause you can see forever\r\nand ever from high places!\c\nSo, how about you and I\nhave some fun?\c
Being your opponent in battle is a new\nsource of strength to me. Thank you!
Win or lose, you always gain\nsomething from a battle, right?\c
Skyla: You're a pretty amazing\nPokémon Trainer, aren't you?\c\nMy Pokémon and I are happy,\nbecause for the first time in a while,\r\nwe could fight with our full strength.\c
Skyla: I'm sure I'd have a great\ntime if I could battle Winona,\r\nthe Hoenn Gym Leader, up in the air!\c
The high-flying girl, Skyla!\nSend 'em flying with your fabulous moves!\c
What I want to find is a young Trainer\nwho can show me a bright future.\c
Thinking about aging is thinking\nabout the time you have left.\c\nNow, since there are\nfewer things I can do,\c\nwhat I want to find is a young Trainer\nwho can show me a bright future.\c
What I want to find is a young Trainer\nwho can show me a bright future.\c\nLet's battle with everything we have:\nyour skill, my experience, and the love\r\nwe've raised our Pokémon with!\c
This intense feeling that floods\nme after a defeat...\r\nI don't know how to describe it.
Harrumph! I know your ability is greater\nthan that!\c
Drayden: Wonderful.\c\nI'm grateful we had a chance to meet\nand battle.\c\nMake a bright future--not just for\nyourself, but for others as well.\c
Drayden: How unsatisfying!\c\nPromise me that we'll see\neach other here once again!\c
The Spartan mayor, Drayden!\nStalwart and strong!\c
You look strong!\nShoots! Let's start!\c

Oh ho, so I'm facing you!\nThat's off the wall.\c\nHow 'bout you and I make some waves\nand sweep the audience away?\r\nLet's leave 'em with even bigger smiles!\c
You're strong as a gnarly wave\nand as nice as a glassy sea.\c
You're tough, but it's not\nenough to sway the sea, 'K!\c
Marlon: You don't just look\nstrong--you're strong fo' reals!\c\nEh, I was swept away, too!\c
Marlon: The tide comes in an' out,\nand in life you win and lose!\r\nWhat's important is that it keeps goin'.\c
Sun shines on this man of the sea!\nMarlon, take everything that comes!\c
A Pokémon battle with you!\nI feel really excited!\c
When I delivered the Pokémon\nto you in Aspertia City,\r\nI never would've imagined then\r\nI'd be battling with you here!\c\nThat's right! Pokémon bring us\ntogether like this, don't they?!\r\nIsn't it a-MAZ-ing?\c
Know what?\c\nWhen I traveled the Unova region,\nso many things happened to me, but\r\nI'm so glad I went on that journey!\c\nI met a lot of Pokémon and\nfound what I really wanted to do...\c\nIt's hard to put into words, but\nI want to express this feeling\r\nthrough my Pokémon.\c
Phew!\c\nYou're really a strong Trainer,\nthat's for sure!\c
The Pokémon on both sides\ntried sooo hard, didn't they?\c
Bianca: Thank you for being my\nopponent! Yep! I learned a lot!\c\nKnow what? Recently, I've been\nthinking Pokémon stay by our sides\r\nto bring people together...\c\nI'm thinking of researching that!\c
Bianca: I love your style\nof Pokémon battling!\c\nSomehow, your Pokémon look like\nthey're having so much fun!\c
It's the young researcher who always\npursues the truth, Biaaaanca!\c
The Fire-type scorcher, Chili.\nThat's me. I will be your opponent!\c
Yeeeeooow!\c\nTime to play with FIRE!!\nI'm the strongest of the brothers!\c
The final round of the tournament...\nGets you fired up, doesn't it?\c\nGet ready for the Fire-type\nscorcher, Chili.\r\nThat's me. I will be your opponent!\c
You got me.\c\nI am...burned...out...\c
I'm on fire!\nPlay with me, and you'll get burned!\c
Chili: Whoa ho! You're on fire!\c\nBut you have to hand it to me\nfor putting up a good fight, right?\c
Chili: Don't worry about it!\nWhen you play with fire, you get burned!\c\nI mean, c'mon, your opponent was me!\nYou didn't have a chance!\c
He's part of the triple-trouble team!\nThe Fire-type master, Chili!\c
That is correct!\c\nIt is I, Cress, Water-type enthusiast,\nwhom you must face in battle!\c
What incredible luck for you--you get to\nbattle the best among the three of us.\c
Just as water flowing from high\nplaces to low places is natural,\r\nso is my victory.\c
Lose? Me?\nI don't believe this.\c
This is the appropriate\nresult when I'm your opponent.\c
Cress: How amazing!\c\nEven if there were a lot of reasons,\nyou managed to defeat someone as\r\nimpressive as me!\c
Cress: How amazing!\c\nEven if there were a lot of reasons,\nyou managed to take on someone as\r\nimpressive as me!\c

Lance: Your Pokémon have responded to\nyour strong and upstanding nature.\c\nAs a Trainer, you will continue to\ngrow strong with your Pokémon.\c
The fury of a long line of Dragon Tamers\nis about to be unleashed. Behold Lance!\c

Wallace, the water illusionist,\nhas appeared on the main stage!\c
I think I could get to like\nthis atmosphere.\c\nIt gives me an idea about the kind of\nperson that battles here.\c
One look at you tells\nme many things about you.\c\nTogether, you and your Pokémon\novercame all the challenges you\r\nfaced, however difficult.\c\nI, Cynthia, accept your challenge!\c\nThere won't be any letup from me!\c
When you are facing a Trainer\nin a battle, you can learn everything\r\nabout them.\c\nWhat Pokémon they have.\nWhat moves they've taught.\r\nWhat items they make Pokémon hold.\c\nThere's no need for words then.\c
Aww!\c\nNo matter how fun the battle is,\nit will always end sometime...\c
What's necessary to become\nstronger?\c\nI think it's important to never lose\nyour love of Pokémon.\c
Cynthia: That was excellent.\nTruly, an outstanding battle.\c\nYou gave the support your Pokémon\nneeded to maximize their power.\c\nAnd you guided them with certainty\nto secure victory.\c
Cynthia: Just a few minutes ago, you were\nthe most powerful challenger.\c\nThe road before you is still very long,\nbut never give up!\c\nYou'll always have Pokémon at your side.\c
It's Sinnoh's archeologist, Cynthia!\nCreate a new history!\c
I show everyone how wonderful it is to\nmove forward together with Pokémon.\c\nCompeting like this is probably the best\nway to show everyone!\c
I've really been looking forward\nto deciding who's the strongest\r\nPokémon Trainer in this tournament!\c\nKiai!\c
I feel fired up when I see another\nTrainer, and I imagine which one of\r\nus is stronger.\c\nWhen I actually face that Trainer,\nthe excitement builds to fever pitch!\c
Well done!\nYou certainly are an unmatched talent!\c
That was an extraordinary effort\nfrom both you and your Pokémon!\c
Alder: Well done!\c\nThe ones who change the world are always\nthe ones who pursued their dreams.\c\nThat's right! They're just like you.\c

Thank you very much.\nI learned a lot from it.\c
Maylene: I can't explain what\nit means to be strong.\c\nI don't know how much effort goes\ninto being strong...\c\nBut being with Pokémon lets us\nkeep making the effort, doesn't it?\c
Maylene: Learn from your foe by winning,\nand learn from your foe by losing, too...\c\nEverything is an experience... Yes.\nPokémon made me realize that...\r\nThat is how I feel.\c

Crasher Wake: The styles of battling and\nwinning are as widely varied\r\nas Trainers are.\c\nDo you want to know how I battle?\nI battle so I can say I had fun at\r\nthe end, whether I win or lose!\c
Crasher Wake: Even if you hold down your\nfoe, what you get is a small satisfaction.\c\nIt's better to bring out your foe's\npower and win!\c\nThen, both can get closer to glory!\c

Fantastic!\c\nYou and your Pokémon\nhave grown much stronger!\c
Even when you lose, your Pokémon\nare still brimming with fighting spirit.\c
Cheren: I made it where I am\nbecause Pokémon were by my side.\c\nPerhaps we need to think about\nwhy Pokémon help us not in terms of\r\nPokémon and Trainers but as a\r\nrelationship between living beings.\c

Well done!\nI learned much from this battle!\c
Remember our battle on Route 4?\c\nPlease bring out more of your\nPokémon's strength, like you did then!\c
Colress: Just as I expected!\c\nYour Pokémon must be happy to\nbe by your side!\r\nYou bring out the best in their power!\c

I'm a Poison-type specialist...\nI'll go...slowly...\c
Nobody can escape from\nmy Pokémon's poison...\r\nHe he... Let's start an experiment.\c
I like the way that the poisoned prey\ngets weaker...\c\nHe he. I won't let it be over soon...\nLet me enjoy it...slowly!\c
You withstood my poison?!\nHow amazingly tough!\c
Your Pokémon seemed to not be happy...\nHe he... I enjoyed that...\c
Castor: Fight fire with fire.\nFight poison with poison.\r\nI lost...\c
Castor: You need to be more poisonous\nto defeat me...\c
Castor's smile is eerie!\nOne man's meal is another man's poison?\c
Ground-type Pokémon are great,\nbecause they are down to earth!\c
We all want to live on this bountiful land,\njust like Ground-type Pokémon, right?\c
I like them. I love them all!\nIf I win this tournament,\r\nI'll become a Ground-type Pokémon.\c\nI will! I'm serious!\c

Delphine: Tee hee!\nHow was my psychic power?\c\nSee you again.\c
A mysterious girl with mysterious power!\nDelphine, come on out!\c
Secrets of Bug-type Pokémon!\nI will teach them to you!\c
You seem to be doing OK, but\nwhen it comes to using Bug-type\r\nPokémon, I'm second to none!\c
You seem to be quite a good Trainer!\c\nBut I cannot lose in the tournament\nfor Bug-type Pokémon!\c
What...?\nI can't believe I lost...\c
The way you use Bug-type Pokémon!\nYou're still an amateur!\c
Walter: I can't believe there is\nsomeone who uses Bug-type Pokémon\r\nbetter than I do...\c
Walter: Start with a clean slate!\nI'll be your opponent anytime!\c
The person who mastered the secrets!\nUser of Bug-type Pokémon, Walter!\c
Booo! ...Kidding!\nI'll show you how scary ghosts are!\c
Oh! There's a ghost behind you!\c\n...Kidding!\nThe scary part is yet to come!\c
Ghosts in a haunted house are\ncheering for me!\c\nTo live up to their grudge,\nI won't lose!\c
Wow! You surprised me!\nWhat a move you used! It was so sudden!\c
This is the real terror!\nDid you sweat with fear?\c

Let's have a battle that won't wound\nthe dragons' noble pride!\c
I'll test you to see if you're worthy\nof having dragons!\c
Your noble spirit was accepted\nby dragons...\c\nEvidently, you are a worthy opponent\nfor the final!\c
This is the end for me... Thank you!\nIt was a wonderful battle!\c
You haven't trained enough...\nTrain your mind.\c
Drakon: I'm very honored\nto be able to fight against\r\na proud Trainer like you!\c
Drakon: I won...\nI express my respect and appreciation\r\nto our proud dragon!\c
He was chosen by fierce dragons!\nDrakon! He takes off now!\c

Margaret: I... I...\nI lost... Ugh...\c\nUgh... Wa... Waaaaaah!\c
Margaret: I knew this would happen...\nNo need to make a big deal out of it.\c
Margaret! Bounce back all attacks\nwith your iron heart!\c
If you choose a dark path,\nprepare yourself!\c
Never do things by halves!\nIf you go to your dark side,\r\ngo all the way!\c
Don't do the crime\nif you can't do the time...\c\nBetter to be a good person\nthan make excuses!\c
Darkness always loses out... Fine.\nThat is the way I chose.\c
Being a good person suits you well.\nDon't come close to this side...\c
Vito: Go!\nGo as your heart desires!\r\nJust go!\c
Vito: The weight of my guilt...\nI found $1 on the road...\r\nand pocketed it... Ahh!\c
He sticks to the art of darkness!\nVito! That's his way of life!\c
Tee hee! I'll torment your\nPokémon now!\c
I'll torment your Pokémon now!\nHe he! Entertain me!\c
Oh, my. Are you trying to beat me?\nWhat an arrogant child!\c\nFine! I'll make you kneel down\nin front of me!\c
Wh...what?\nCould it be... I lost?\c
There's nothing impressive about you.\nTee hee! Kneel down there!\c
Impera: Remember me!\nNext time when we battle,\r\nI'll be worse on you!\c
Impera: Did you hear this cheer?\c\nTeee he he he he!\nI'm the queen of darkness!\c
She twists any enemies around\nher finger!\r\nThe queen of darkness, Impera!\c
Play fair in a Pokémon battle?\nHuh! All I care about is winning!\c
No matter what Pokémon you use,\nI'll exploit your weaknesses\r\nand hold you down!\c
I've prepared a lot of traps!\nI'll do anything to win!\c\nThe one who will get the cup\nis me!\c
...Our attacks didn't work?!\nYou... You're not fair!\c
Well, well. I still had way more\ndirty tricks!\c
Bonnie: Argh...\nThat leaves me one choice...\r\nRun!\c
Bonnie: This is a game.\nSo, no hard feelings.\r\nSee you!\c
Yeah! What's wrong with being unfair?\nThis is Bonnie's way!\c
How unlucky that you have to\nbattle me in the first round!\c
You seem to be pretty good,\nbut your luck ran out when you met me!\r\nI'll win this battle!\c
I don't think anybody can come this far\nby just luck!\c\nLet me see your skill!\nI'll go all out, too!\c
Ugh... This is the end!\nYou totally overpowered me!\c
How about that?!\nThose are my skills!\c
X: Tsk!\nI was unlucky that I had to battle\r\nagainst such a strong Trainer like you...\c
X: Yes, that's right!\nI'm the one who'll win\r\nthis tournament!\c
His remarkable skill and knowledge!\nPlease welcome X!\c
I'll beat you easily just for a warm-up!\c
My Pokémon's bodies must've warmed up\nby now!\r\nI'll break you off a piece!\c

Makina: I was being careless...\nIt won't be like this next time...\c
Makina: No matter how strong you are,\nI can't lose so easily!\c
Nobody can stop her winning streaks!\nLet's go! Makina!\c
...Are you nervous?\nTake a deep breath, and fight.\c
Your shoulders are tense.\nTake a natural attitude,\r\nor you can't show your true ability!\c
What a great cheer!\nDon't be overwhelmed by this atmosphere.\r\nAll you have to do is fight as usual!\c\n...Now, bring it on!\c
I wasn't expecting that...\nWell, you outsmarted me.\c
...What's wrong?\nIs that all you've got?\c
Fidel: You're a quite interesting\nTrainer!\r\nI learned a lot from you.\c
Fidel: You still have a long way to go!\nYou won't be able to be a Champion\r\nunless you make a much greater effort!\c
Veteran Fidel!\nHis experience is his biggest weapon!\c
Are you ready?\nThen, here I come!\c

Her calm judgment is her strength!\nTheodora, please show up on the stage!\c
Oh! You look strong!\nLet's start a match now!\c
I came here to see strong Trainers!\nAre you strong?\c\n...Well, it will be clear very soon!\c
You must be incredibly strong!\c\nWoooow! I'm getting excited!\nI feel my energy bursting!\c

Allan: Ah! It was fun!\nPlease have a battle with me again!\c
Allan: Get much stronger!\nI'll battle you anytime!\c
It's the martial-arts expert, Allan!\nHe's seeking strong opponents!\c
I've trained and trained and trained!\nI'll show you my power!\c
As you'd expect from the\nPokémon World Tournament,\r\nall participants are full of character!\c
I'll prove that the hard training\nI've done so far was not a mistake!\c
I can't win even after the hard training?\nThere's always somebody above me!\c
I won! Yes!\nI'm strong, just as I thought!\c
Jocelyn: You're incredible!\nI'll train even more, and someday\r\nI'll be better than you!\c
Jocelyn: Tee hee!\nYour training is not enough yet!\r\nStart afresh!\c
She'll show us the fruits of her training!\nJocelyn! Unleash your Pokémon!\c
I will show the public that my research\nis right by my victory!\c
I'll win at any cost to prove that\nmy Pokémon research is right!\c
When this match is over,\neveryone will know\r\nthat my research is right!\c\nHere I come! I won't lose!\c
...My research of many years...\nWas it a waste...?\c
Wa ha ha! How about that?\nThis is the result of my research!\c
Dmitri: No...\nMy research was not wrong.\r\nYou're just superior to me...\c
Dmitri: Wa ha ha!\nMy Pokémon's power is not just like this!\c
Pokémon Professor! Dmitri!\nHe shows up with his ambition!\c
Finally, it's time to show off my Pokémon.\nI won't lose!\c
I'll win this battle as well,\nand I'll show my Pokémon to everyone!\c
Wow! This is on TV, right?\c\nThis is my Pokémon's TV debut!\c
Aww... I wanted to let them shine\nmore in the battle...\c
This is the Pokémon that I'm proud of!\nPlease remember it!\c
Levina: Even though we lost,\nit's OK.\r\nI love these Pokémon the best...\c
Levina: What a cheer!\nI wonder if now everybody loves\r\nmy Pokémon.\c
Levina loves her Pokémon!\nHer love for Pokémon is second to none!\c
From now on, it's my time.\nLet me battle at my pace!\c
I won't let your strategy confuse me.\nI'll stick to my way\r\nand win this battle!\c
At last, the final...\nI've captured your essence.\c\nIf I focus and battle,\nI won't lose!\c

Rylan: I lost when I lost\nsight of my battle...\r\nWhat was I doing...?\c
Rylan: Only people who stick\nto their own way will win...\c
He's doing it his own way!\nMy way, Rylan! Come on in!\c

Attention! Show respect!\nLet's fight fairly and go all out!\c
Attention! Show respect!\nLet's have a good battle.\c\nI'm very happy to be able to\nfight against someone like you!\c
That was a great Pokémon battle.\nBut...I'm disappointed by myself.\c
It was a great battle!\nAre your Pokémon OK and not hurt?\c
Destiny: I'm frustrated, but...\nIt's polite to praise the winner!\c\n...Thank you very much!\c
Destiny: Thank you very much!\nLet's have a battle again!\c
She begins and ends a battle with\nrespect. A very polite fighter, Destiny!\c
I feel that if it's with you, this battle\nwon't be a simple competition\r\nbut a battle where I can ponder\r\nthe relationship between\r\nPokémon and their Trainers.\c
Do you want to show how strong you\nare by winning, or do you want to\r\nlearn what battling really means?\c\nPokémon battles have no meaning if\nyou don't think about why you battle.\c\nOr better said, it makes battling\ntogether with Pokémon meaningless.\c
Even if hurt, my Pokémon will fight\nfor me with just one command.\c\nI think you'll value and trust\nyour Pokémon more if you keep\r\nthat fact close to your heart.\c\nWhat can I do for these Pokémon?\nWhat should I do?\c\nThat's right! I battle with everything\nI have to find the ideal relationship\r\nbetween Pokémon and people!\c
Thank you!\c\nI feel like I saw a little of\nthe way toward my ideals.\c
Even when you lose, your Pokémon\nare still brimming with fighting spirit.\c
Cheren: I'll keep battling many Trainers\nand Pokémon like this, and if I can\r\nlearn what kind of person I am, it will\r\nopen up my path.\c\nI'm sure this path will lead me to become\nthe person I'm meant to be.\c\nPokémon will always be with you and me as\nwe go down our own paths.\c\nOur important friends, Pokémon...\c
Cheren: Pokémon are by all of our sides--\nmine, yours, and each and\r\nevery Trainer's!\c\nThat's why we move forward!\nThe Pokémon walking alongside us\r\ngive us the strength to do so!\c
How will he battle with rental Pokémon!\nCheren, what will you do?!\c
Get ready! I'm gonna knock\nsome sense outta ya!\c
Fight with this Pokémon this way...\nUse this item that way...\r\nAre you letting others decide that\r\nfor you?\c\nWell, whatever, but what's important\nis figuring out what you want to do!\c\nGet ready! 'Cause I'm going to knock\nthe common sense outta you and drag\r\nyou into a brand new world!\c
You don't do anything!\nWhat do you know?!\c\nYou don't do anything!\nHow're you gonna change?!\c\nBut, I've got you covered!\nI'm gonna give your reason a\r\ntoxic shock and open up your mind!\c
Wild!\c\nYour reason's already\nmore toxic than mine!
Hey, c'mon! Get serious!\nYou gotta put more out there!\c
Roxie: You didn't win... I lost!\c\nI was weak and made my Pokémon\nfeel how much losing stinks!\c\nWatch out! Next time we meet,\nI'm going to give you a toxic shock!\c
Roxie: Ya can't win 'em all.\nIt's impossible, seriously!\c\nTrying to look cool every\ntime you mess up or fail\r\nis totally exhausting!\c\nSo you just have to\nlet it all hang out!\c
When you have real power, different\nrules won't slow you down! Go, Roxie!\c
Thanks again for your help.\c\nMy rental Pokémon are scurrying with\nexcitement about getting to battle you.\r\nLet's get straight to it!\c
If the battle brings out the\nbeauty in Pokémon,\c\nit will be a scene that makes\nmy heart flutter, win or lose.\c\nLet's get straight to it!\c
M'hm...\c\nIf I win this battle,\nI feel like I can draw a\r\npicture unlike any before it.\c\nOK! I can hear my battle\nmuse loud and clear.\c\nLet's get straight to it!\c
Is it over?\nHas my muse abandoned me?\c
Wow...\nIt's beautiful somehow, isn't it...\c
Burgh: Aww...\nI lost.\c\nWhatever! Losing to you doesn't bug me,\nbecause you are a-MAZ-ingly strong!\c
Burgh: Sometimes I hear people\nsay something was an ugly win,\r\nbut I think if you're trying your best,\r\nany win is beautiful.\c
This tournament puts your strength\nto the test! Burgh, how will you battle?\c
My rental Pokémon are going\nto make your head spin!\c
I'm me, and Pokémon are Pokémon!\c\nI feel that strongly when I\nbattle with Pokémon moves,\r\nand that's why I do it.\c
C'est fini!\c\nWhen I'm certain of that, I feel an\nelectric jolt run through my body!\c\nI want to feel that sensation, so, now,\nI'm going to make your head spin!\c
I meant to make your head spin,\nbut you shocked me instead.
That was unsatisfying somehow...\nWill you give it your all next time?\c
Elesa: My, oh my...\nYou have a sweet fighting style.\c
Elesa: You're a shining\nstar of a Trainer, but\r\nmy Pokémon shone brighter!\c
Bring out the best in Pokémon!\nYou can do it, Elesa!\c
Yer tougher than ya were when\nI gave ya that Gym Badge, right?\c\nWell, how 'bout we have ourselves\na look and see what ya can do now.\c
How much stronger ya get comes\nfrom how much you want to win!\c\nAlways be loyal to that desire,\nya hear?\c
If ya want ta win,\ndon't make excuses! Got it?\c\nIf yer gonna bellyache,\njust forget 'bout fightin'!\c\nWell, I might be fussin' 'bout\nnothing when it comes to you.\c
Well, I've had enough... And just so you\nknow, I didn't go easy on you.

I shall admit defeat...\nYou are much too strong.\c
Thank you very much.\nI learned a lot from it.\c
Maylene: I can't explain what\nit means to be strong.\c\nI don't know how much effort goes\ninto being strong...\c\nBut being with Pokémon lets us\nkeep making the effort, doesn't it?\c
Maylene: Learn from your foe by winning,\nand learn from your foe by losing, too...\c\nEverything is an experience... Yes.\nPokémon made me realize that...\r\nThat is how I feel.\c
This tournament puts your strength to\nthe test! Maylene, how will you battle?\c

Crasher Wake: The styles of battling and\nwinning are as widely varied\r\nas Trainers are.\c\nDo you want to know how I battle?\nI battle so I can say I had fun at\r\nthe end, whether I win or lose!\c
Crasher Wake: Even if you hold down your\nfoe, what you get is a small satisfaction.\c\nIt's better to bring out your foe's\npower and win!\c\nThen, both can get closer to glory!\c
Bring out the best in Pokémon!\nYou can do it, Crasher Wake!\c

A new girl Trainer!\nHave the courage, and come on out!\c

I love Pokémon battles\nmore than playing house. ♪\c\nI have great Pokémon, don't I?\nHurry up and play!\c
I lost. But thank you!\nIt was so much fun!\c
Ahhhh! Is it over already?!\nThat's no fun!\c
Play with me again!\nPromise me!\c
I wanted to play more!\nIt ended too soon!\c
She's always with her Pokémon!\nLet her play with a Pokémon battle!\c
My Pokémon are unbeatable!\nThey won't lose!\c
My Pokémon are the best!\c\nThey won't lose no matter what kind of\nPokémon you have!\c
I've raised a lot of Pokémon\nand made them learn cool moves, too!\c\nI'll win the tournament!\c
Why?\nMy unbeatable Pokémon...\c
Did you see them?\nMy Pokémon are great, aren't they?\c
They just didn't feel well!\nUsually they are much much stronger!\c
They're great, aren't they?\nI won't lose to anyone!\c
She's confident about Pokémon battles?!\nCome on! Let us see your power!\c
I'll win the tournament with the Pokémon\nthat I worked hard to get!\c
I knew this Pokémon was strong!\c\nI didn't spend days and days to find\nand catch it for nothing.\c
Even on rainy and windy days,\nI pursued this Pokémon tirelessly.\c\nI'll be the best with this Pokémon!\c
What?\nWhy did this Pokémon lose?\c
Yes! I knew it.\nThis Pokémon is the strongest!\c
I'll come back after raising Pokémon\nmore seriously.\c
Tee hee. I feel I found\nthe Pokémon of my destiny.\c
She entered this tournament\nwith new Pokémon!\c\nWhich Pokémon will she use?!\c
If you get scared, it's OK to run.\nDon't push yourself. Just surrender!\c
Tee hee. I'll win with\nmy overwhelming power.\c\nIf you want to run away, now is the time!\c
My opponents in the first and second\nrounds both surrendered!\c\nI'll show my overwhelming power\nto you, too!!\c
Whoa! Please wait!\nYou... You've got me.\c
Tee hee! I showed you the difference of\nability between you and me!\c
[VAR 0100(0000)]... I didn't know such a\nstrong Trainer was in this tournament...\c
You're unlucky that you had to battle\nagainst me!\c
Finally, her turn has come!\nHer skills are not just for show!\c
Hmm... I wonder what kind of strategy\nyou're going to use?\c
Battling with a total stranger is fun,\nbecause you don't know\r\nwhat will happen. Here I come!\c
You've also made it this far.\nIt looks like you have an audacious\r\nplan up your sleeve...\c\nAll right.\nI'll anticipate your every move!\c
I just couldn't read your attack\nat all...\c
Right on! Your attack was just\nas I predicted!\c
I didn't see that coming there...\nThe way you battle is incredible!\c
Plan your strategy a little bit more.\c\nOtherwise, your opponent will anticipate\nyour actions.\c
She's really good at mind games!\nYou can't hide anything from her!\c
I'll send your Pokémon flying\nwith my extraordinary attack!\c
I want to get a kick out of\nsending your Pokémon flying!\c\nLet's have a good fight!\c
You've made it this far. Well done!\c\nI'll send your Pokémon flying\nto the edge of Unova!\c
Eek! You sent my Pokémon flying!\c
No one is a match for me!\nAh! I feel great!\c
You beat me so spectacularly,\nwhich strangely makes me feel great!\c
Hee hee! You won't beat me\nunless you train your Pokémon\r\neven harder!\c
Come in, powerful Trainer!\nTheir attack will break even a rock!\c
My thought-out strategy is\nmy biggest weapon!\c
No matter what kind of attack you\nchoose, you won't beat my strategy!\c
I've thought about how to make my\nPokémon battle from morning until night.\c\nThe way I battle is the result of that!\c
What? You outsmarted me?!\nWhat a smart Trainer!\c
You fell for my trick.\nThis is how I battle!\c
No, you're not just smart...\c\nYour passion to beat my strategy\nwas very impressive, too!\c
Well, I refine my strategy\nby winning like this!\c
Pokémon tactician! What kind of\ntactic is she going to use today?\c
Watch! These are my best\npartner Pokémon!\c
I finally raised Pokémon with which\nI can battle with confidence.\c\nYou have no chance to win!\c
You have no idea how hard it was\nto raise my Pokémon to this level.\c\nThese are my best partners.\nLet's have a battle!\c
Ha ha ha...\nThere's always someone better...\c
He he! With these Pokémon,\nI'm confident that I won't lose to anybody.\c
Raising Pokémon is endlessly complex!\c
Is that all? You'll never be able to beat\nmy partners like that!\c
She's come here with her\nideal Pokémon!\c
I can never stop my excitement\nbefore a Pokémon battle.\c
So, you're my next opponent!\c\nI'm starting to get excited!\nI wonder what kind of battle it will be.\c
At last, this is the final battle!\nI feel my heart beat faster!\c\nLet's battle. I won't forgive you\nif you go easy on me!\c
I can't get enough of such\nfun battles!\c
Phew! Until the last moment,\nI couldn't relax a bit.\c
Thank you very much for making\nme so excited!\c
The tournament is fun because we\ncan have this kind of battle, right?\c
The energetic and exciting Trainer!\nShe'll fight with a smile!\c
I've made efforts for this day.\nI'll show you the fruits of my practice!\c
I've practiced every day to win\nthis tournament!\c\nI won't lose at any cost!\c
We've had intense training\nto be the Champion!\c\nNo matter what kind of Pokémon you use,\nwe won't lose!\c
Did I lose...?\nArgh... You're too strong...\c
Easy breezy!\nMy practice paid off.\c
...I'll practice even more,\nand someday I'll be better than you!\c
Hmmm.\nYou haven't practiced much, have you?\c
He practices every single day!\nHere is a man of efforts!\c
I'll show you in this tournament that\nmy Pokémon are the best in the world.\c
Whichever Pokémon comes,\nmy Pokémon won't lose!\c\nThat's because they are the strongest\nin the world!\c
Only one person can reach the top!\nAnd...it's not you!\c\nIt's me, because I have\nthe world's best Pokémon!\c
It's not my Pokémon's fault.\nIt's my fault.\c
He he!\nDid you struggle a bit?\c
I'll train again with my Pokémon!\c
Don't be ashamed.\nMy Pokémon are too strong!\c
He keeps running to reach the top.\nHe claims to be the world's best!\c
The stronger one will win...\nIt's that simple. Here I come!\c
I don't need a strategy!\c\nEven if we think a lot,\nonly the stronger one will win!\c
Don't think deeply!\c\nThe strongest Trainer will be\nthe Champion!\c\nThat's it! Here I come!\c
You were stronger!\nI hate to admit it, but it's a fact!\c
You tackled me head-on!\nIt was not a bad battle!\c
Move forward without thinking!\nYou can go further and further.\c
Battle is like this!\nMake an effort and get stronger!\c
He only believes in strength!\nHow far can he go?!\c
If I focus and make no mistakes,\nI'll win for sure!\c
The enemy is inside of me...\nSharpen my mind...\r\nBattle perfectly, without any mistakes!\c
I haven't made any mistakes so far.\nI've been able to focus!\c\nI'll have a perfect battle\nand win the tournament!\c
It can't be! Why?!\nI don't think I made any mistakes!\c
It was a perfect victory.\nPhew. I'm so glad...\c
Did I lose because I didn't\nobserve you well...?\c
Mistakes are scary...\nYou miss the chance to win.\c
He's a perfect Trainer!\nHe carries out everything as he planned!\c
I'll show you the difference\nin experience!\c
I'll put everything I've learned\nso far as a Trainer into this battle!\c
This hot match!\nWhat counts in the end\r\nis the built-up experience!\c\nI'll teach you that!\c
It can't be! I can't believe\nthat my experience didn't matter!\c
How about that?!\nThat is the difference in experience!\c
You... You must have overcome\na lot of terrible experiences!\c
Have further training, and\ncome back again!\c
He's very experienced!\nFinally, the star Trainer's turn!\c
I want to win for people\nwho cheer for me!\c
Support of people in the arena will\ngive power to my Pokémon and me!\c\nI can't lose!\c
If I win the tournament,\npeople who cheer for me\r\nwill be pleased!\c\nI must win at all costs!\c

First of all, Trainers have to cheer for\ntheir own Pokémon!\c
Tee hee hee!\nThank you for your support!\c
Her battle mesmerizes everyone!\nYeah! Our favorite girl, come on in!\c
I yield to no one when it comes to\nmy affection for Pokémon.\c
I came here with my favorite Pokémon.\nI can't lose!\c
There is something I don't want to lose\nto anyone.\c\nThat's my affection for my Pokémon!\c\nYes! Let's battle!\c
I'm frustrated that I lost...\nBut you also love Pokémon!\c
Yay! ♪\nHa ha ha! I love all of my Pokémon!\c

Wha--? Why are you so quiet?\nHey! Are you scared? Ha ha!
...Clunk!\n...CLANG! Rumble-rumble-rumble!
Eeeek! Let me off! It's gonna break!!\nDaddy! Mommy! Save meee!
Oh! It's going higher and higher!\nBoy...this takes me back...
Oh! Look at that over there!\nIt's absolutely stunning...
Wow... That's right...\nIt was like that then, too...
Phew... It's so muggy.\nI shouldn't have worn my apron.
Sweat is making my clothes stick to me...\nI'll be fine. Check out the scenery.
Yeeesh...\nI'm completely drenched in sweat...
...Clunk!\n...CLANG! Rumble-rumble-rumble!
Good grief! This ride is worn out...\nI just don't get what's fun about this...
So bored... Well, this'll be the last\nI'll see of this view for a while...
The look of the town doesn't change...\nBut I do, I guess...
Hee hee... My baby's kicking.\nMaybe it's enjoying the view, too...
Hee hee hee... My little one\nis sure moving. Must be having fun...
It was...two years ago...in summer.\nI felt... It was...
Sniff... That's right...\nI'm sure... But...
Said I like you... It was a lie!\nIt wasn't... Sniff...
I wonder if other people look at\nus and think we're a couple.
Don't move from that spot.\nBe still... Just like that...
Looking out the window seems dangerous.\nJust look straight at me...
Footprints left on snow-covered ground\nare all I have left to remember you by. ♪
Ghost, oh my Ghost-type daaarling...\nYou can't feel my Normal-type touch! ♪
We're finished. We've reached an impasse.\nYou're colder than a winter Froslass! ♪
Well, it's good to do something like\nthis and relax every now and again.
Wow! Awesome!\nWe're so high up!
Well...\nThat was kinda fun.
Huuuh? Was that...\nHmm... Maybe I got it wrong...
Wow!\nThis is sooo neat!!
Maybe...\nI got a little overexcited.
[VAR BE09(0001)]You...\nremind me of that Trainer.[VAR BE09(0000)]
[VAR BE09(0001)]Now that I think about it,\nwe both rode this Ferris wheel, too.[VAR BE09(0000)]
[VAR BE09(0001)]Making dreams come true is hard...\nI wonder if we will meet again...[VAR BE09(0000)]
I don't really get what's so fun about\nriding the Ferris wheel.
That's the Skyarrow Bridge, and\nthat's Pinwheel Forest over there.
Maybe I enjoyed that a little bit. I\nguess I still need to work on having fun.
Ah. Umm...\nI'm a little nervous for some reason...
It's strange...\nTalking with you makes me feel so happy...
That's why I wanted to meet you\nin person...and say thank you.
It's just the two of us.
When I'm with you,\nI feel so relaxed somehow.
I can finally thank you!
I never get tired of this view.
Is it because I'm with you?
Aww...\nIt's over already...
The Unova region sure is pretty,\nisn't it?
But it's not the only thing that's\npretty around here.
I wish the whole world could go slower.\nThis Ferris wheel... Time...

うまれてから　しばらくの　あいだは\nせなかの　タネから　えいようを\nもらって　おおきく　そだつ。
せなかの　つぼみが　ふくらみだすと\nあまい　においが　ただよいはじめる。\nたいりんの　はなが　さく　まえぶれ。
あめの　ふった　よくじつは　せなかの\nはなの　かおりが　つよまる。かおりに\nさそわれ　ポケモンが　あつまる。
ヒトカゲの　しっぽの　ほのおは\nいのちの　ともしび。げんきな　ときは\nほのおも　ちからづよく　もえあがる。
リザードが　くらす　いわやまを\nよなかに　みあげると　しっぽの\nほのおが　ほしのように　みえる。
くるしい　たたかいを　けいけんした\nリザードンほど　ほのおの　おんどが\nたかくなると　いわれている。
こうらに　とじこもり　みを　まもる。\nあいての　すきを　みのがさず\nみずを　ふきだして　はんげきする。
いちまんねんの　じゅみょうを　もつと\nいわれている。ふさふさの　しっぽは\nながいきの　シンボルとして　にんき。
こうらの　ロケットほうから　ふきだす\nすいりゅうは　ぶあつい　てっぱんも\nいっぱつで　つらぬく　はかいりょく。
あかい　しょっかくから　においを\nだして　てきを　おいはらう。\nだっぴを　くりかえし　おおきくなる。

やわらかい　からだを　つよくおすと\nむらさきいろの　なぞの　えきたいが\nにじみでるので　ようちゅうい。
むかしは　じょうぶな　カラで\nせなか　ぜんたいを　おおっていた。\nさいぼうに　その　なごりが　ある。
２ほんに　わかれた　しっぽは\nいろんなことが　きように　できるので\nほとんど　てを　つかわなくなった。
あてもなく　うかぶ　ようすから\nまよえる　たましいの　みちしるべ　と\nつたえる　むかしばなしも　ある。
ゆうぐれ　むれになって　おおぞらを\nかぜに　ながされていくが　きづくと\nいつのまにか　きえてしまっている。
いつも　まるめている　みみを\nいきおいよく　のばすと　おおきな\nいわも　かんたんに　こわせる。
みみは　とても　デリケートらしく\nやさしく　ていねいに　さわらないと\nしなやかな　あしで　けられてしまう。
じゅもんのような　なきごえだが\nまれに　あいてを　しあわせにする\nこうかも　ひめているという。
ドンカラスが　ひくいこえで　なくと\nすぐさま　ヤミカラスが　あつまるため\nよるをまねくもの　とも　いわれる。
トレーナーが　エサを　くれないと\nはなのあなに　ツメをひっかける\nひどい　いちめんを　ひめている。
どうたいを　しっぽで　しばりつけて\nじぶんを　おおきく　みせている。\nめがあうと　いつまでも　にらみあう。
とびはねると　くちのなかにある\nたまが　あちこちに　はんしゃして\nすずのような　ねいろと　なる。
おしりからとばす　くさい　しるの\nにおいは　はんけい２キロに　ひろがり\nまわりの　ポケモンは　いなくなる。
しっぽの　さきから　ひどい　においの\nえきたいを　とばして　こうげきするが\nうえから　ねらわれると　とまどう。
おおむかしの　ドーミラーは\nかがみのように　はんしゃしていたと\nかんがえる　けんきゅうかも　いる。
べつせかいへの　あなを　あけて\nそこから　あめを　ふらしていた。\nそのため　ほうさくのかみ　とされる。
かんそうした　くうきを　このむ。\nすいぶんを　ちょうせつ　するときに\nだす　みずが　なみだに　みえる。
めにみえる　あいての　かおや\nうごきの　モノマネを　することで\nどんな　きもちか　わかろうとする。
ちいさないしを　かかえるのが　すき。\nあいての　あしもとを　あるきまわって\nついつい　ころばすことも　ある。
ベロは　にんげんのものに　そっくり。\nそのため　にんげんの　はなすことばを\nじょうずに　まねることが　できる。
いつも　わるさばかり　していたら\nふしぎな　じゅつで　ほんたいを\nかなめいしに　しばりつけられた。
おおぐちを　つかった　こうげきは\nいりょく　じゅうぶんだが　まだ\nうまくたたかえず　じぶんもきずつく。
ひかりかがやく　ものが　だいすきで\nどうくつの　なかで　みつけた\nたからを　じぶんのすに　ためこむ。
こうそくで　かけぬけると　つばさは\nくうきの　やいばを　うみだし\nまわりのきは　せつだん　されている。
ひっしに　エサを　たべているうちに\nからだの　けのしたに　かくしていた\nエサのことを　わすれてしまうのだ。
よろこびや　いかりと　いった\nかんじょうを　なみのかたち　として\nみわける　ふしぎなちからを　もつ。
きたえられた　ルカリオは　はどうを\nつかい　１キロさきに　だれがいるのか\nどんなきもちか　さえも　わかる。
はなの　あなを　ぴたりと　とじてから\nすなのなかを　あるくように　すすむ。\n１０ぴきていどの　むれで　くらす。
いがいと　おこりっぽい　ポケモンで\nくちを　おおきく　あけることで\nまわりに　つよさを　アピールする。
しっぽのはさみが　とじると　どうじに\nはりのさきから　どくが　にじみだす。\n１ねん　なにもたべずに　たえられる。
もうどくを　つかわなくても　じまんの\nちからで　あいてを　バラバラにする\nがんじょうな　からだの　もちぬし。
せいせいどうどうと　たたかうことは\nすくないが　それも　いきのびるため。\nマスコットとして　にんきが　たかい。
のどもとに　どくぶくろを　もつ。\nのどを　ならすと　たまった　どくは\nねりこまれ　きょうりょくになる。
しっちたいに　はえる　きにまきつき\nあまいかおりの　だえきで　えものを\nおびきよせては　ひとくちで　たべる。
からだの　よこがわにある　ラインは\nたいようのひかりを　ためておける。\nよるになると　あざやかに　かがやく。
ながい　ひれを　あしのように\nつかって　かいていを　はっている。\nランターンと　えものを　とりあう。
テッポウオと　たわむれながら\nすいめんを　はねている　ようすを\nみるための　ツアーが　おこなわれる。
にんげんに　きょうみが　あるのか\nゆきやまで　あしあとを　みつけると\nそのまわりに　あつまってくる。
ゆきのはなが　さくころ　どこからか\nすがたを　あらわし　はながちると\nまた　どこかに　すがたを　かくす。
しんかして　さらに　ずるがしこくなり\nツメで　いしに　サインをつけて\nコミュニケーションを　はかっている。
ジバコイルを　かがくりょくで\nしんか　させようと　こころみる\nしゅうだんが　いたが　しっぱいした。
ながいしたは　いつも　だえきまみれ。\nだえきには　ものをとかす　せいぶんが\nふくまれており　さわると　しびれる。
きんにくを　ちからを　こめて\nしゅんかんてきに　ふくらませることで\nてにした　いしを　ふんしゅつできる。
しょくぶつで　できた　うでは\nほうっておくと　からみついてくる。\nきってもきっても　すぐに　はえる。
あいての　こうげきを　きにせず\nちかづいては　しっぽを　おしつけて\nこうあつの　でんりゅうを　ながす。
せっし２０００どの　ひのたまを\nうちだすとき　ブーバーンの　からだは\nねつのため　ほのかに　しろくなる。
おたがいの　そんざいを　みとめあい\nむだに　あらそわない　ひとのために\nさまざまな　めぐみを　わけあたえる。
あごの　ちからは　けたはずれ。\nこうそくで　とんで　すれちがいざまに\nあいてを　かみちぎるのが　とくい。
きほんてきに　あらそわない。\nさいぼうが　しょくぶつに　ちかくなり\nたいないで　こうごうせいが　できる。
たいおんを　コントロールすることで\nしゅういの　くうきを　こおらせて\nダイヤモンドダストを　ふらせる。
わずかな　かぜのながれに　うまく\nのると　いちども　はばたくことなく\nこのほしを　いっしゅう　できる。
１まんねん　まえの　じめんから\nこおりづけの　マンムーが　みつかり\nしかも　めざめたので　さわがれた。
いじげんでも　かつやく　できるよう\nプログラムを　しゅうせい　したが\nねらいどおりには　いかなかった。
だれかを　まもろうと　したとき\nひじをのばし　かたなのように\nへんか　させて　はげしく　たたかう。
チビノーズと　よばれる　ちいさな\n３つの　ユニットを　じりょくで\nじゆうじざいに　あやつっている。
だんりょくのある　からだの　なかに\nいきばのない　たましいを　とりこんで\nあのよに　つれていくと　いわれる。
マイナス５０どの　いきを　ふきかけ\nこおらせた　えものを　ひみつの\nばしょに　かざっていると　いわれる。
でんきのような　からだは　いちぶの\nきかいに　はいりこむことが　できる。\nそして　そのからだで　いたずらする。
ユクシーが　とびまわったことで\nひとびとに　ものごとを　かいけつする\nちえ　というものが　うまれた。
エムリットが　とびまわったことで\nひとびとに　いきるときの　よろこび\nかなしみ　というものが　うまれた。
アグノムが　とびまわったことで\nひとびとに　なにかを　するための\nけつい　というものが　うまれた。
ディアルガの　しんぞうが　うごくと\nじかんは　ながれていくと　されている\nシンオウの　でんせつ　ポケモン。
パルキアが　こきゅうを　するたびに\nくうかんは　あんていすると　される\nシンオウの　でんせつの　ポケモン。
がんじょうな　はがねの　からだだが\nじぶんが　はっする　こうねつの　ため\nところどころ　とけてしまっている。
とくしゅな　ひょうざんや　がんせき\nマグマから　じぶんの　すがたに　にた\nポケモンを　つくったと　いわれる。
あばれもの　ゆえ　おいだされたが\nやぶれたせかいと　いわれる　ばしょで\nしずかに　もとのせかいを　みていた。
みかづきに　ちかい　よるほど\nしっぽから　のびる　オーロラは\nながく　うつくしくなる。
あたたかい　うみを　ただよっている。\nどんな　とおくに　ながされても\nうまれた　ばしょに　かならずもどる。
うまれたときから　そなわっている\nふしぎな　ちからを　つかうと　どんな\nポケモンとも　こころが　かよいあう。
じぶんを　まもるために　まわりの\nひとや　ポケモンに　あくむをみせるが\nダークライに　わるぎは　ないのだ。
ひとに　やさしく　だきしめられ\nありがとうの　きもちを　かんじると\nぜんしんの　はなが　ひらきだす。
なにも　ない　ばしょに　あった\nタマゴのなかから　すがたを　あらわし\nせかいを　うみだしたと　されている。
