When the move type matches the type of the\nPokémon using it, the power of the move\nis greater than usual.\n\nWhen a Pokémon has two types, either one\ncan affect the power.\n\nSome move types have no effect at all\non Pokémon of certain types.
Moves are classified as Physical, Special, or\nStatus moves. You can tell which is which\nby their icons.\n\n-Physical Moves\nPokémon's Attack and Defense stats\ndetermine the overall damage of this type\nof move.

Your chances of capturing a Pokémon\nare better if you lower your target's HP\nbefore you throw Poké Balls.\n\nIf you use Pokémon moves to inflict a Sleep\nor Paralysis condition on the target,\ncapturing it will be even easier.
Pokémon and their moves fall into\n17 different types. Each type has\nits own advantageous and disadvantageous\nmatchups against the others.\n\nFor example, Fire-type moves are more\neffective against Bug- and Grass-type\nPokémon but are less effective against\nWater- or Rock-type Pokémon.
When the move type matches the type of the\nPokémon using it, the power of the move\nis greater than usual.\n\nWhen a Pokémon has two types, either one\ncan affect the power.\n\nSome move types have no effect at all\non Pokémon of certain types.
Moves are classified as Physical, Special, or\nStatus moves. You can tell which is which\nby their icons.\n\n-Physical Moves\nPokémon's Attack and Defense stats\ndetermine the overall damage of this type\nof move.
-Special Moves\nPokémon's Sp. Attack and Sp. Defense stats\ndetermine the overall damage of these types\nof moves.\n\n-Status Moves\nThis type of move is not a direct attack, but\nit can raise the Pokémon's stats and inflict\nstatus conditions that help them in battles.

Exp. Points are shared among\nthe Pokémon in a battle. To help\na weak Pokémon receive Exp. Points,\ntake it out and switch in a strong Pokémon.\n\nWhen you trade and receive a Pokémon\nfrom another Trainer, it'll gain more\nExp. Points than Pokémon that\nyou've caught yourself.
Pokémon sometimes evolve.\nWhen they do, their appearance changes\nand their stats increase.\n\nThere are many ways to evolve.\nYou can evolve some Pokémon by leveling up,\nsome by using items that evolve Pokémon,\nand some by trading a Pokémon with a friend.\nEach Pokémon has its own way to evolve.

Have we met or not? I don't remember.\nWell, nice to meet you!
Yahoo! Ya-hoooooo!\nI won again!
No way! Nooo way...\nI lost again...
All right!\nI will show you my power!
Amazed? Surprised?\nBy the power of my Pokémon?!
You are incredible!\nI am astonished and surprised!
May... May I help you?!
Oh! Oh!\nYes, we can?!
Un-un-unbelievable!
Don't let your guard down,\nor you may cry when a kid beats you...
I may be young, but I don't think\nI will lose, even against grown-ups.
Fweh! I am just a kid!\nYou are fighting for keeps!
Let's have an awesome\nPokémon battle!
Mmmph! Mmmmmph!\nYou see, it's fun to win!
You are pretty amazing!\nAnd you have totally exhausted me...
Very serious from the very beginning.\nAre you ever really prepared for this?
Seriously, winning a serious battle is\nseriously great!
Seriously, I lost. I am seriously depressed.\nBut you are seriously cool.
Go easy on me!\nThis is my first battle...
I can't believe I won my first battle!\nSay, did you go easy on me?
Ouch! That hurts!!\nBut... You are great...
You... You know,\nthese Pokémon are my friends.
I... I... I am sorry...\nI just wanted to introduce them to you.
Just being with these Pokémon\nmakes me happy...
...Heehee. I'm confident in calculation\nand analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned...\nI don't feel like losing.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis\nare no match for coincidence...
We're about to have a Pokémon battle.\nAt the very least, we say hello!
That could have gone better,\nbut thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration,\nbut thank you very much.
I am studying every single day...\nSo I am taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon is fun.\nI want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost...\nI may be better at studying.
I want to be a Pokémon research\nscientist when I grow up.
I'm wondering if Pokémon research\nprojects require test subjects...
I must do my best to learn\nmore about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong...\nI hope I will be all right...
Oops, you were not as strong\nas I expected... Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer!\nWhat you see is what you get.
I always get the best grades!\nI will try to be No. 1 for everything!
I will keep winning, winning, winning...\nI will be No. 1!
If I lose at such an early stage,\nI cannot be No. 1.
Wha--? You wanna fight with me?\nI suppoooose...
Ah, I shoulda known.\nDon't blame me.
Oh, wow. I am no match for you.\nYour Pokémon are great.
Mrrrrr... Mmrr grrr...\nGrrrrr... Mrrrrr...
Grrrrr... Mmrrrr...\n...Oh? Did I win?
Grrrrmmm... Mrrr...\nOh? Is that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe and\nthe mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell.\nI am worried about your future prospects.
I got carried away.\nI am worried about my future prospects.
Are you my opponent?\nYou look kind of hungry.
Have you eaten well?\nYou cannot do well on an empty stomach.
Are you really an ordinary person?\nWhat do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity,\nso I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you lost.\nNow, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won't give you\nmy lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon.\nI don't think I will lose.
You see! I am fine as long as\nI listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mommy! Where are you?\nPlease come and hug me!
A Trainer who looks gorgeous!\nI hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost against me?!\nI am a little disappointed.
Oh my, the battle was also gorgeous.\nI find myself drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you like?\nHey, hey. Let me see!
Your taste in Pokémon is excellent, \nbut you are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful,\nbut you are a first-class Trainer!
I am sorry--I lied.\nI am not a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to me\nwhen I pretended to be rich.
The truth is I am just the daughter\nof a Clerk ♂.
Ahaha...
Ahahaha...
Argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you!\nNice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna!\nTank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost!\nTank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler!\nI am already prepping for college.
You lost against a Preschooler...\nHow old are you again?
I am confident in studying, but\nI am just a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am a hero!\nI refuse to lose!
I AM a hero!\nI beat the bad person!
A hero never loses.\nA hero never dies.
I am very strong.\nI will never lose.
Daddy gave me these Pokémon!\nThey've got to be strong!
AAAAAAAAAH!
I thinks it are strange\nit complaining when they lose.
When I win, I are glad!\nHip, hip, hurray!
Boo!! I did lost... I are frustrated,\nbut I guess things my own fault.
Are you going to bully me?
You didn't bully me. I like you!
You bullied me, but I like you\n'cause you are strong!
Gmmmmm! Pokémon!\nGive it all you've got!
Mmmmph! Yahoo! Yahoo!\nThank you very much, Pokémon!
Boooooo! Come on, Pokémon.\nTry harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best!\nTrainer, do your best, too!
I am four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you are weak.
I am four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nI am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nDrifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nUntil I see you again...
I am not an ordinary Backpacker,\n'cause I am a newlywed.
'Cause my wife and I have no money,\nwe're hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
This trip is our honeymoon!\nBut I wandered off from my wife...
I am in the middle of my penniless travel.\nIt has its own charm.
Travel is best when you are poor\nand when you are young.
Aww... I am hungry...\nPlease spare something...
Argh! My backpack is heavy!\nWhy is it so heavy?
Why is this backpack so heavy?\nDid you put something in it?
Arrrgh! Why didn't you wait\nuntil I put down my bag?!
I wanted a short trip to heal my broken\nheart, but it's been a few months now...
A trip cannot heal my heartbreak...
I have no home to return to,\nso maybe I will live as a drifter...
Hm. I wonder who you are.\nI wonder if you'll have a battle with me.
You... You are weak.\nOr am I just strong?
You are strong.\nI wanna run away.
Sometimes I need a little time to rest.\nI will relax here!
That was a nice, refreshing time.\nI will work hard tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing.\nNow I am more stressed out.
I hope to work hard, save money,\nand have a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream.\nI just want to have a normal life.
I want to have security and happiness\nrather than chasing a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! \nWe have very fresh ingredients!
What do you think of my Pokémon?\nThey are fresh!
Thank you very much!\nHow were mine?
Didn't you come here for\na Pokémon battle?
Don't be scared, or\nyou will never win.
You are a strong Trainer.\nPlease forgive me.
Hiya, honey! Welcome!\nHave you decided what you'll have?
Order up! One humiliation\nin a Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory\nin a Pokémon battle, sunny side up.
Meow, meow, it's a battle, meow.\n(That sounds stupid, doesn't it?)
Yeah! Meow! I won, meow!\n(I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I lost, meowww.\n(Seriously, I am sooo embarrassed.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than\nanybody else's. Love can do anything.
This victory proves\nmy true love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love should\nhelp me win, shouldn't it?
Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon\nthat I am proudest of?
What do you think about my \ndear Pokémon? Aren't they great?
Oh, my goodness!\nMy poor Pokémon...
For the honor of the branch office!\nHere I go!
I am the branch manager of the Pokéfan.\nI won!
Pfft. Good-bye for now, child!\nI'll remember this!
I lost a lot of things because\nI love Pokémon too much...
I've devoted my life to Pokémon. \nI see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my devotion.\nWhat shall I do?!
Listen. I love love love Pokémon.
I will be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too!\nPlease let me pet them!
I am not good at battling, but\nthis is one of the duties of a Pokéfan.
I kept the honor of the Pokéfan.\nHahaha.
Cheers, all you Pokéfans!!\nMay the Pokéfan last forever!
I wanted to go hiking,\nbut I took the wrong train.
Well, this place is also interesting.
Ah, mountains... The mountains are\ncalling me.
I am no mere Hiker.\nCall me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me\nis properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous matters.\nThat is an alpinist.
I'm a Fisherman, so I have my rod here,\nbut this is cumbersome.
I won the battle, but\nI did not need this rod at all.
Ah... This rod is so cumbersome!\nI will quit fishing!
Oh, I kin tell yer rilly sumpthin'.
I knew it. You rilly ARE sumpthin'.
Like always, the big one done got away.
I won't be a Parasol Lady without\na parasol, so I must use it.
I think it is strange to use\na parasol indoors, though.
My parasol... My parasol is broken!\nI will be just a Lady.
My boyfriend left me on a rainy day.\nSo I will take it out on you.
The rain is piercing my broken heart\nand washing it clean.
They say rainy days never stay,\nbut will the rain in my heart ever stop?
I've been waiting for someone like you\nfor a long, long time.
I know you are the best.\nI will never let you go.
I like you.\nPlease be my friend.
I won't go easy on you just because\nyou're a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You cannot have a battle\nif you are afraid of losing.
Humph. I am still weak.\nI feel sorry for my Pokémon...
I am bad and stupid, but\nI am very serious about Pokémon.
I feel peaceful only when I am with Pokémon.
I hope you will find something\nyou can be serious about.
My shiny bald head is my secret.
The more I shave my head,\nthe stronger I can be.
You should have\na shiny bald head to be stronger.
You must be laughing at me 'cause\nI rode this far on my motorbike.
I've decided to live my life on my bike.
I am a coward who cannot even go out\nwithout my bike.
I am roaring around on my bike\nand chasing my own dream.
I feel I am getting one step closer\nto my dream.
You have to follow your own dream!
I am a Biker.\nBut I've never ridden a bike.
I am a Biker.\nI don't have any friends yet.
I am a Biker.\nI've never won yet.
My Pokémon are on the rise! I raised\nthem with special yeast bread!
You'll get well again if you\neat my special bread.
You are strong.\nAre you eating my special bread?
One loaf, two loaves... No matter how\nmany times I count, one loaf is missing.
One loaf of bread is missing...\nThe master will be angry...
Oh, I'm so resentful...\nWhere is the missing loaf of bread?
Hey, you!\nDo you eat a good breakfast every day?
I never miss breakfast,\nso I am healthy and plump!
The first step for healthy living is\nto eat a good breakfast.
I am not loafing on the job!\nI am on patrol!
This place is dangerous!\nThis is too much fun!
I know about trouble like you!\nI am keeping my eye on you!
I am a Policeman!\nIn other words, I am justice!
Justice always prevails!\nThat is why I won!
I... I am a Policeman!\nWhy did justice fail?
I got scolded by my boss, and I lost\nmy motivation. I'll take it out on you!
Hehehe. You see!\nI am brilliant here.
Oh, man! \nAm I useless here, too?
I am young and fresh!\nI am nothing if not young!
What do you think? What do you think?\nI am very strong, aren't I?
I am fine even when I lose a battle.\nI am lively, lively!
I worked my way up to the top of the\ncomedians, and now I am a big shot.
You have a good sense of humor.\nDo you want to be my assistant?
Looking at you reminds me of friends\nfrom when I was working my way up.
I cannot do impressive stunts,\nso I will perform normally.
I am sorry. I shouldn't have won.\nI am just a Harlequin.
I am a Harlequin, but I'm sorry I cannot\nplay the fool after I lose.
I am smiling, though I am sad at heart.\nThis is the play of a lifetime!
You! That's not in the script!\nYou ruined the play!
Ha ha ha! It is the destiny of a Harlequin\nto smile when he loses.
Oh, no! I came to play\nwithout taking off my uniform.
Wow! Seriously? I won!\nI cannot go home when I win.
Ahhhhh! And I lost!\nThis is not my day.
You know, I am very popular,\nthanks to this costume.
Being popular is simple...\nI like it that way.
I feel good 'cause I am popular, but\nsometimes I feel empty.
Welcome back.\nYou must be tired from your work.
You must be tired.\nPlease do rest awhile.
That was superb!\nYou are very strong indeed.
I used to be so popular, but\nnow I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success, I took it\nfor granted, and I did not work hard.
As times change, values change.\nI realized it too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses.\nIf you lose, I hope you'll model for me.
I will do a sketch of you,\nfrustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait. I can create a masterpiece\nif you are my model.
Sensitivity is important for battles, too.\nYou! Feel it!
You need to feel it more! More!\nOtherwise you cannot win!
Ahh! I sense it!\nI sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!
Everybody grows bit by bit\nif somebody cherishes them.
I have cherished these Pokémon\nsince they were small.
You are also here \nbecause someone cherished you.
These days, when children fight,\ntheir parents fight on their behalf.
Children of childish parents.\nWhat kind of adults will they become?
Childish fights among adults are\nworse than fights among kids.
Iaaaa! You are cute!\nI want to take you home as my own!
Your face is cute even when you've lost!\nI want to comfort you, little one!
Ooooh! You are really cute!\nI want to raise you as my own!
I'll show you we can break you.\nWe've trained in the field!
How were my Pokémon?\nThey're very powerful, aren't they?
That's strange! I wonder why...\nI shouldn't be outmuscled.
Oh, you look very active!\nWhat say we battle?
OK! It's done!\nHow are my partners?
Goood, you are young!\nMy partners were totally crushed!
Pokémon battles after work\nare the one thing I truly enjoy.
Ahhhhhhhhh!\nThat's why I cannot quit training Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh. It hurts.\nIt hurts for a single man like me.
Pokémon are popular at work, too.\nOld guys can enjoy these battles!
Am I good for a guy who just\nbattles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both enjoy\nbattling with Pokémon.
Keep pedaling even when your legs\ncrumble. This is the secret of Cyclists.
A Pokémon trained by cycling\ncould never lose against a person like you.
My cycling has no limits.\nI will challenge you again someday.
My steel-wheeled friend brought me here.\nIsn't it the greatest ever?
This is my best friend forever!\nAlways reliable and true as steel!
I blundered, stumbled, and lost...\nWell, I still have my one and only.
Fun time is over.\nTime to wake up!
The end always comes as a shock.
You are greatly mistaken if you\nthink you can dream forever.
I'm done! It's just not good enough.\nA Bicycle is not enough of a challenge.
A Bicycle cannot satisfy me.\nI will join the Bikers!
Faster!! I want a speed that nobody\ncan beat!
I won't surrender to you.\nYou are nothing but a young fellow!
I won't lose against whippersnappers!\nI shall struggle on until the day I die!
Impressive! You are skillful for a\ngreen stripling, young fellow!
Like a powerful foaming cleanser,\nI will remove you!
Like a well-polished tile,\nthis is a sparkling victory!
Like a worn-out dust rag...
I am doing this job because\nI love love love trains.
You are happy if you choose something\nyou like as a job.
I love trains too much.\nIt's a sickness, really...
Your journey will end here.\nI am your terminal.
I praise you for coming up here.\nBut now, go home!
Ah... I didn't see it coming.\nI will rest over here...
I need to prove I'm worthy.\nI cannot lose against a child.
Am I childish? Adults do\nwhatever it takes to win.
My honor, my pride... I cannot show myself\nto my coworkers in such a miserable state.
Hey, I've learned a few things in my time.\nLet me demonstrate!
Not everyone likes me, but\nI am quite the Trainer, aren't I?
Your technique shows wisdom...\nAre you also an old man?
They say a company with lively workers\nis a good company!
I work hard all the time!\nI can battle 24/7!
Oh, look at the time!\nI have to get back to work!
My boss is seriously annoying!\nI believe I'll take it out on you!
Thank you for having a battle with me.\nI feel much better.
You should choose your company carefully,\nbecause you cannot choose your boss.
Are you my next patient?\nGet over here!
Good, good. I am glad\nthat you and your Pokémon are obedient.
Wait! You, wait!\nThe surgery has not started yet!
When there is a patient, I will be there.\nThat is my job.
Please put yourself at ease!\nYour Doctor is here.
If you are hurt, please call me.\nI'll be there for you.
Please go easy on me.\nI just finished my night shift.
After all that work, let's relax\nwith some Pokémon battles!
Yawn... I'm sleepy...\nI can't stay awake any longer...
How are you and your Pokémon?
I will inject you with my energy!
People can do so much\nas long as they have energy!
A Gentleman should have\na liking for battles.
A Gentleman should bask\nin the elegant glow of his victory.
A Gentleman should accept the result of\na battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of Pokéfans.
You can learn a lot from mature women,\nsuch as wisdom and good manners.
Woohoo! Were you knocked out by\nthe Socialite's charm?
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Oh-ho! Let's have a unique\nand elegant battle.
Ah-ha! I was not confident, \nbut this is a delightful surprise.
Eeeeee! I'll remember this!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon...\nPokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your Pokémon,\neven when you lose.
It is important to nurture and train\neach Pokémon's characteristics.
Do you discipline your Pokémon?\nPampering them too much is no good.
You need to discipline Pokémon you\nlove when they are misbehaving.
Too much praise can spoil\nboth Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you.\nThey will return the love you give them.
This proves my love has been received\nby my Pokémon.
It's about time for me to give someone\nmy affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for\ntraining good Pokémon?
The tip for training good Pokémon is\nto catch good Pokémon.
You don't seem to need any tips\nfor training good Pokémon.
Glad you made it! It won't be\nan easy job from here.
Haha! You see!?\nYou are not ready yet.
Earlier I got a little carried away,\nbut what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and dad are Ace Trainers.\nSo I am an Ace, too!
I want to be an Ace Trainer like\nmy mom and dad.
Waaaa! I should have superior genes and\nbe able to ride on my parents' coattails...
I don't mind your lack of focus, but you\nwill get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see! You did not focus\non the battle. That's why you lost.
That is quite enough. It's over.\nDon't stare at me!
Dad... Mom...\nI'll have a battle. Look...
Dad... Mom...\nDid you see me? I won... I won!
Dad... Mom...\nWhat shall I do?
I came here to goof off.\nI don't want to cram for the big test...
I cannot lose...\nI don't want to study anymore.
No! I don't want to go home!\nI don't want to study!
I just want to be successful\nand grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday and\nput you to shame.
I don't care who you are\nor where you come from.
How should we act?\nThat is all that matters, isn't it?
A label is not important, is it?\nAfter all, you are you, aren't you?
Pokémon battles and study sessions\nare much the same. Let's be efficient!
You are too inefficient.\nYou need to be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such a slacker?\nI cannot believe it!
I have money to burn,\nso I don't want anything.
The only thing I enjoy\nis a Pokémon battle...
Just because I am rich\ndoes not mean I am especially happy.
Yes! I am a Rich Boy!
Well, good-bye!\nYou have been beaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci!\nYou defeated a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun,\nbut I'll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance.\nPlease pay it no mind.
It's good when you battle for fun.\nIf it's too serious, you won't enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a\nbattle. I am rich. I always have fun!
I do not have to work,\nbecause I am loaded with cash.
All play makes me a dull girl.\nDo you think I don't know that?
I'm proud of these Pokémon!\nGo on, rush the enemy position!
My Pokémon are mighty!\nI will carve my name in history!
I won't cry... I won't.\nSomeday, I will be able to win.
I came here for my big brother\nwho always hides in his room.
My big brother the hermit,\nI won for you! Come out and play!
I wish my brother would\ncome out of his room and play with me...
Hello me old china,\ntime for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and write,\nTrainer, many clinks!
Even if you dipper, you'll be fine.\nBest of friar, Trainer!
All Dad and Mom do is mumble\nat their computers! That's no fun!
I don't like Dad, or Mom, or computers!\nAll I need are my Pokémon!
Instead of mumbling to computers,\nI wish they would talk to me...
A globe-trotting young adventurer.\nThat's me!
Seeing Pokémon all over the world is\nthe purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me.\nFarewell! See you again!
Let's take it easy\nwith Pokémon and with life.
It's OK to bust your tail. But you need\nto have some breathing room.
No problem. No problem.\nI will have another chance.
I've traveled 3,000 miles searching\nfor a husband! A journey to nowhere.
Please let me know if there is a rich,\nwealthy, or affluent gentleman!
My goal is a wedding band...\nBut is that really a utopia?
A game is life,\nbut life is not a game.
I am always serious. You cannot win\nif you think this is just a game.
I'll give up games forever and set out\non a journey... Just kidding!
I'll always work part-time, because\nit lets me focus on what I really love.
You have only one life to live.\nAre you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever\nwithout being tied down.
I took this job 'cause I wanted to see\nsmiles on people's faces.
Don't look at me like that.\nSmile! Smile!
It's very frustrating,\nbut I am glad I saw you smile.
Let's start a battle already!\nWe are wasting time.
What? Is it already over?\nWe still have lots of time.
We ran out of time.\nWe cannot go into overtime!
I am battling here to promote\nthe café where I work.
You are not that strong,\nso you are not really right for my café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer!\nSee you at my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokéfans.\nYour life will be happy!
If you join the Pokéfans,\nyou'll be strong like me!
If you join the Pokéfans,\nyour life will be saved!
I am not a regular Pokéfan.\nI am a major mega-Pokéfan!
I love Pokémon.\nI love love Pokémon!
You'll remember this!\nI am a big Pokéfan!
I think I am a Pokéfan,\ntherefore I am a Pokéfan.
The Pokéfan is power.
You should remember this.\nI am a Pokéfan.
There are young and beautiful people,\nbut youth is different from beauty.
If I had known that when I was young,\nI would not have a hard time now...
Youth is just youth.\nI wish I had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain standing\nin my way, aren't ya?
Yahoooooo!! Yahoooooooo!\nHear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared\nin a crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\nI am a Hiker. I have a cult following!
Oh no? It's over already?\nHiker is bored!!
This is important, so remember this!\nDon't judge a book by its cover!
Despite my appearance, I am the head\nof a certain outfit. Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone that I am playing here.
The boss does not have freedom.\nI feel like a captured Pokémon.
The truth is, I want to have a quiet life\nfishing all day, every day.
Ah... I don't want to do anything but fish.\nI am tired of winning and losing.
At my time of life, it doesn't matter\nif I win or lose.
Hello? Me? What, now?\nI am about to have a battle.
Hello? Can you hear me?\nI just won the battle.
Ah... Hello? Can you hear me?\nArgh! I lost...
He told me that I was like a squall,\nbut what is a squall?
W-wah! Wahhh!\nI am so happy that I am crying.
W-w-wahhhhh! Wahhhhh!\nWahhhhh! Wahhhhh!
No need to chat with someone\nI'm about to battle.
Life is over if you lose.\nThat's why I hold out.
Don't look at miserable me!\nGo away!
You have your way.\nI have my way.
I will go my way 'cause\nI don't have any other way.
Your way must be rocky.\nGood luck. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don't mess with me,\nor I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble for me,\nbut what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move?\nGah, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both Veterans,\nbut I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad\nif they see that I've become a Roughneck.
I cannot be like my mom and dad.\nSo I will live as a Roughneck.
My partner has turned to dust,\nbut his Pokémon is my Pokémon now.
Are you watching me, my long-lost partner?\nThat Pokémon of yours, we get along...
He was trash, but now he is eternal,\nlike the stars in the sky... Ah, my partner!
I am no good at speaking...\nSo my bike speaks...
Zooooom! Zoom whoosh!\nZooooom! Zoom zam!
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!\nVrooooooooom! Vroom!
All right! Are you ready?\nDon't mess with a Biker!
I'm a Biker, so I'm more obsessed\nwith speed than anyone else!!
The truth is we are good guys.\nWe cannot do bad things at all!
Like uncooked dough,\nmy Pokémon are sticky!
Now you're stuck, aren't ya?
Well, your Pokémon are quite springy, too.
As I bake bread, I will bake your\nPokémon, too.
Oh my... Your Pokémon are like\nburned bread.
Ah, how frustrating and disappointing!\nYou burned me with that last move...
Just as I knead the dough,\nI'll knead you into shape.
Wanna be kneaded a little more?\nOr shall I sandwich you with bread?
Ooooo! I'll remember this!\nI'll turn you into a sandwich someday!
Laughing makes people feel better.\nThere seems to be scientific proof!
Haaa ha ha! Ha?\nWhat's wrong? Let's laugh!
Laugh at miserable me--I lost against\namazing you. Laugh and you'll feel better.
You think you can win against me?\nIt might not go as smoothly as you think.
Don't underestimate me just because\nI am a Harlequin.
No. This can't be happening.\nYou're not an ordinary person.
Observe my beautiful Pokémon magic!\nPlease watch closely!
I know a few gimmicks and tricks,\n'cause this is magic.
Tricks and magic are my bread and butter.\nAny Harlequin knows their worth!
Tedious talk is unnecessary...\nI will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I'm broken...
I have low self-esteem,\nso I like someone to give me orders.
You are not my boss, so\nit doesn't matter even if you are weak.
Can I call you my boss?
This outfit is not a uniform,\nit's what I like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime.\nDoesn't it look good on me?
I want to live in a world of games,\nanime, and comics forever.
I'm not cut out for a regular job,\nso I live on art.
I envy Pokémon, 'cause they are\ncarefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah, if I can do a regular job,\nI will quit doing this stinking art.
Every time a Pokémon uses a move,\nmy heart will tremble!
Nothing stirs the soul\nmore than Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful!\nI could almost faint!
I will make you cry,\n'cause you just don't know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and confusion\ncan also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate the value\nof defeat and sorrow.
Our job is hard,\n'cause it's such physical work.
My work gave me these great muscles.
Don't underestimate the power of kids.\nLike I did with you!
Raising Pokémon and raising kids.\nBoth are very hard.
When my Pokémon do well like this,\nI forget my everyday troubles.
Even I raise them with tender care,\nbecause I am their Trainer...
Hey, you!\nI promise I will take it easy on you!
Heheh... I will take it easy on you. Heh.
Sometimes even grown-ups want\nsomeone to take care of them.
The job site is quite dangerous, but\nI'll have to keep working with Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well,\nand it's ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I cannot make money tomorrow\n'cause I am injured.
Welcome!
Only the winner!\nOnly the winner can celebrate.
Enough... That's enough...
I do menial work every single day.\nAm I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down\nthe smooth running of this machine!
I may be happier than a person who\ncannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I'm the Worker\nthat everybody is talking about.
If you don't know me, you're bogus!\nGood-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker\neverybody's talking about.
Well, let me introduce myself.\nThese are my little darlings.
How was it? My little darlings are tough and\ncute, aren't they?
Phew! Your little darlings are awesome, too!
Whir, whir, whir, whoooosh!
Ring-ring! Ding-ding!
Bam!
This is the very latest model,\na limited-edition, carbon-fiber Bicycle.
When you have good tools,\nyou feel better about yourself.
Don't! Please don't touch my Bicycle.\nYou'll cover it with your filthy fingerprints.
Speed is the key in a battle!\nDash! Dash! Dash!
If I compare how I'm feeling right now to a\nrace, it is just like crossing the finish line!
I cannot take your nonsense anymore!\nI am moving back to my mother's place.
Hey, you! Take out all the Pokémon\nyou have here!
Huh? That's all you have?\nAren't you hiding a few more Pokémon?
I see. There seems to be nothing\nsuspicious about you or your Pokémon.
I'll protect my peace by myself.
My peace remains protected.
Please don't disturb my peace and quiet.
I was born to work.\nThat is my destiny.
I will work, work, and work some more.\nI am happy only when I am working.
As a matter of fact, having battles\nis my job, too.
I'm-a lowest rank now, but\nI'm-a gonna be at the top someday!
I'm-a gonna be the brightest star\nin the business! Top of the world, ma!
You work it like a shining star!\nI'm not gonna lose, I'm not gonna lose!
I have an ambition!\nI will take over the company!
All this serves my ambition!\nIt brings my sweet victory one step closer!
I was obsessed with the golden prize,\nwith my glittering ambition!
I am treated as an idol at the office.\nEverybody pampers me.
Everybody works for me,\nso I have nothing to do.
The truth is I don't like brushing my teeth\nor taking a bath, but don't tell anyone.
You look dusty.\nI'll give you a good scrub!
OK, you look a little bit cleaner now!
Hey! Don't run away!\nYou need to be scrubbed more!
These fruits of stubbornness were raised\nstubbornly by a stubborn old man.
This stubborn old man raised them.\nMy persistence is different from yours!
There's a fine line between persistence\nand stubbornness. I may retire soon.
I'm good at driving, but\nI'm not good at dealing with Pokémon.
Oh, it went unexpectedly well.\nBy any chance, am I a technician?
My train does what I need. It's harder to\nconvince living Pokémon to do things my way.
I've never left this place even once\nsince I was born.
I wonder if I will live here\nfor the rest of my life...
I wonder how long I will stay here...\nWhat is there outside this world?
I say this as a Doctor.\nFirst of all, you must save money.
Money cannot buy health.\nBut you cannot stay healthy if you're poor.
Because without money, you can neither\neat healthy food nor go to see a Doctor.
As you can see, I am a Doctor,\nbut I've never examined a patient.
I've studied to become a Doctor,\nbut I faint when I see blood.
I am a Sunday Doctor,\nrather like a Sunday driver.
Can you understand\nwhat medical personnel need?
What a Doctor needs is love--\nthe rush of unconditional love.
Medical service is love.\nCan you be a Doctor?
I took this job because I wanted\nto be needed by someone.
My job is hard,\nbut I am happy to help people.
When a patient leaves the hospital,\nI feel happy but a bit sad.
Grown-ups have a lot of hobbies.\nActually, I am a uniform collector.
I am not a Nurse.\nI wear this uniform just for fun.
You realized that I am a fake Nurse!\nYes, I am just a uniform collector.
Even if you are injured, I will treat you.\nSo let's fight hard.
Sorry! I went too far. Do you require\nimmediate hospitalization?
You went too far! I will bill you\nthe cost of my medical expenses!
I raised these very special Pokémon\nusing a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak\ndepending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn't supposed to be like this.\nDid I blend the essence wrong?
Shall I share an exclusive tip\nfor training great Pokémon?
You'll be perfect if you buy my book\nof Pokémon training tips.
You'll be fine if you buy my DVD\nof Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family!\nSee the solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters!\nOur family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My family!\nWhat have you done?!
What you like and what you're good at\nare different, or at least separate.
I am good at battling,\nbut I don't enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job,\nyou have a sense of fulfillment, don't you?
In summary, you cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win, because\nyou are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good.\nYou are really pretty good.
Don't underestimate me because I'm old.\nI'll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I'm old but still going strong!\nI can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat a helpless\nold man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon. But I have\nno one to carry on the family tradition...
If I had a child like you,\nmy golden years would be carefree...
I wish my son were\nas mature as you are.
I feel sad when I see a young and\nbright child like you.
The first flush of youth...\nYou are too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin...\nI won't get them back.
Hey! It's me. It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in the world!
How's that? Pwned!!
You! Who are you?!\nDo you know who I am?
I'm at the top of the heap! I'm a man\nwho always wants to come in first.
Remember this! My favorite words\nare "top of the heap."
You. Well done!\nSee you! I'll remember this!
I won't back down, lose, or fail!\nNo defeat for a Clerk ♂.
Uh-huh!
Uuugh... Well done...\nYou made me fall to my knees...
I can do it! I can do anything!\nI will do it! I will do it!
Yes! I did it! I can do it!\nI can do it! I can doooooooo it!
But I listened to my Teacher's advice.\nI can't lose! I can't!
My research will lead this world\nto peace and happiness.
I am a genius. I will control\nthe future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed\nto lose against someone like you...
Only research is left in my life.\nI abandoned my family and friends.
It's not bad to devote my whole life\nto research, is it?
Dedicating yourself to something\ncan cause loneliness.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... Please lend me\na hand for my experiment.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... I did it.\nThe experiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good...\nThis experiment was a failure...
You must face off against\nmy extremely powered-up Pokémon!
Well, this is a natural outcome.\nThe power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have even more awesome\nstrength than the power of science.
If you lose, I'll have you help me\nin my latest experiment!
Ho hi ho. You lost! You will help science\nas my new assistant.
Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up\nas my new assistant.
Why do people compete and fight?\nThis is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt your\nopponent's feelings.
If you lose, you may resent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Foooooooooooo!
Eeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense.\nPretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a sport\nare the height of vileness...
Defeat is worth nothing.\nLosers don't need words...
He-he-he. If you lose,\nI will turn you into a Pokémon.
He-he-he. Well, from today on,\nyou are already a Pokémon.
Next time I see you, I will turn you\ninto a Pokémon with my power.
Argh... I have a headache...\nI have such a headache...
I don't need psychic powers.\nPlease stop this headache...
If I don't keep using my power for battles,\nmy headache won't go away...
I claim that I am a Psychic,\nbut I cannot use psychic powers.
I am camouflaging it\nwith my Psychic-ish costume.
I go to magic classes\nto look like a Psychic.
...Grrr... Yeeek!!\nAn evil spirit! Go away!!
OK! The evil spirit\nthat possessed you has disappeared.
Evil spirit!\nLeave the Trainer at once!
I praise your courage for challenging me!\nI am the one with the strongest kick.
Haha... I probably did not have to use\nmy strongest kick on you.
Oh... The Pokémon did the fighting.\nMy strong kick didn't help a bit.
'Suuup! I'll give it all I've got!\nLet's do our best!!
'Sup! That's enough!\nPlease value your life!
'Suuuuup! Good work. I tried everything\nI could, but I'm disappointed.
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don't have to impress me.\nYou can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It's sad to say good-bye,\nbut we're running out of time.
Are you ready?\nI'll take the gloves off.
Well, well... You're not even in my league.\nThis is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe I lost!\nWho are you?!
I would like to do the fighting\ninstead of my Pokémon if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a\nchallenge. I want to make this personal.
Ah, I tingle with excitement.\nI would like to fight...
Halt at once! You over there!\nLet us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield! \nPlease spare me. Please!
When I am surrounded by nature,\nmost other things cease to matter.
I won. But victory is nothing,\ncompared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn't matter to the vastness\nof nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I am a city boy.\nSo I yearn for country life.
Do you have a hometown?\nIf so, you should go back and visit there.
I don't have a hometown to go back to,\n'cause I was born and raised in the city.
It's my mission to protect nature\nand all Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural order,\nI will put them all in jail!
Protect Mother Nature!\nOtherwise, I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect\nMother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich natural\nenvironment and for the Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by\nsaving money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn.\nLet me give you a crash course!
You didn't win alone. You couldn't have won\nwithout your Pokémon.
You seem to be quite confident.\nI'll sink you straight away.
I am devoting my body and soul\nto Pokémon battles!
AAAAAAAAH! I am sooooo scared!\nI will never do it again... Sorrrry!
I'm working very hard, but\nthat doesn't mean I am strong.
You're a strong Trainer,\nso I think I was just lucky this time.
Even I can lose?!\nBut I'm a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but\nI became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have\nclear goals. That's the way it goes.
I'm still not popular even though\nI've been recognized as an Ace.
The lead character of this story...\nI'll tell you who it is!
The lead character of the story is me!\nYou are just an extra!
Of course, you are the lead character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon battle\nagainst the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time\non such a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho-ho-ho! That is to our liking!\nWe find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and\nfight forever. That's the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won't be\nsatisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn't it?
Your fighting style suits you very well.\nYou can be an Ace Trainer.
I can see despair in your eyes.\nBring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected.\nYou should start training all over again.
Did I underestimate you as just a little kid?\nOr was this your true ability?
Hey, you, young Trainer.\nI am utterly stylish, aren't I?
I am so stylish,\nI hypnotize myself! Step back!
I'm a wreck. I'm adrift. It just kills me.\nIt is hard to be too stylish.
I won't lose against a kid like you,\nwho doesn't know anything about battles.
After all, you are an amateur. No sweat.\n(Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner?\nHa ha ha... I had no idea!
Argh. Cough, cough. I don't feel well.\nPlease show a little kindness.
I lied when I said I didn't feel well!\nVeterans do anything to win!
You're very sharp!\nYou did not fall for my illness act.
I will give you a taste\nof a Veteran's well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran's Pokémon?\nDefeat is bitter, isn't it?
You have served me a spicy defeat.\nAnd yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute!\nCome, I promise to be nice in this battle.
You are so cute, really...\nI want to see you again. I'll be waiting.
Your battle is a little too cute.\nLet's play again sometime.
Oh, you are still a child.\nWho said you could come here?
You're not bad, but you're immature.\nCome back when you've learned something.
I thought you were a child.\nHee hee... You are tough...
Don't call me a Veteran!\nA woman's mind is always blooming.
I'm not finished with love or Pokémon.\nI'll stay fit and ready all my life.
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and\nmy back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker.\nI have a lot of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack,\naren't I? Aren't I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag!\nWait, my Bag has a hole...
I am not traveling for freedom.
You're carrying bulky luggage,\nbut do you really need it?
My Bag is as wide as the sky.\nIn other words, my Bag is empty.
I haven't eaten anything for days.\nSpots are floating before my eyes...
Those aren't spots floating before my eyes.\nThose are glorious glimmers of victory!
Ah, I'm sinking fast. All I can think about\nis where my next meal is coming from...
Neither my husband nor I have money,\nso we are hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
Newly married, and such a big trip...\nI'm worried about our future.
On top of that, I have lost track of him...\nWhere can he be wandering?
Hey! Hey! \nPlease check out my cute Pokémon!
How about that?\nI'm proud of these Pokémon.
Oh no, don't bother them like that!\nPlease leave my Pokémon alone.
Being a Waiter is my disguise,\nand it helps me live quietly.
On my days off, the real me is ready.\nI'm an Ace Trainer!
I'm struggling to make a living,\nso I've been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest.\nI don't think I will lose.
Do you think you can win against me\nwith such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It's hard.\nIt sure is frustrating to lose.
Don't you think a restaurant\nfor Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will like\na full-course meal for Pokémon.
It's a restaurant for Pokémon,\nnot a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Haroooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the mountain range of your life!\nCross me if you can!
Haha! I am the summit, and the road\nto reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed the mountain!\nThis is my summit!
If I lose, I'll spill the secret of fishing.\nIf I win, I'll tell you the essence.
The essence of fishing is to pull\nand reel in the fish--nothing else.
The secret of fishing is to wait without\nthinking, as if you were dozing off.
I always aim for a big fish!\nStay out of this if you are a small fish!
Reeling you in was hard work.\nYou put up a good fight!
Oh! What a great hit!\nBoth my arms and heart are electrified!
You look kind of mature.\nI like people like you.
Still, you look mature for your age.\nAre you already an adult, or are you a kid?
A man with the heart of a boy\nis just a wheedling child.
How much did this parasol cost?\nWhy, it is a cheap disposable.
I am a Parasol Lady, but I cannot\nspend money for a parasol.
A parasol is just a tool. It’s fine\nas long as it protects me from the rain.
I can really cut loose in Pokémon\nbattles without being scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That's why\nPokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don't ya?\nYou are my pal.
My computer friends said I wouldn't be\ntaken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared...\nMaybe I am not cut out for this.
Eeek... I should have played\nwith my computer in my room.
My ride and I\nare always together.
My ride helps me show off who I am.
My motorbike makes me feel better\nwhen I lose.
I don't have money to buy gas,\nso I have to push it with my feet.
I'm one of the Bikers,\nso my bike is crucial.
Ah... Dad, Mom.\nIt's hard to be a Biker...
Aah, I am so hungry that I am\ncompletely wiped out. What shall I do?
I'm working at a bakery, 'cause I want to\neat bread anytime I want.
Aah! I crashed from my sugar high!\nSomeone give me a pastry!
OK, I will do it! \nI am excited about this!
Blast!
I'll remember this!
I'll confuse you with my smooth moves.\nA-one, a-two, cha cha cha!
You could not focus on the battle,\n'cause you were watching my smooth steps!
And one, and two, and twirl, and...\nAh, that didn't work at all! 
Sorry to keep you waiting.\nYour idol, Harlequin, Harlequin.
Thank you very much.\nIt was Harlequin, Harlequin.
It was Harlequin, Harlequin.\nThank you for your support.
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I'll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange.\nI feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of blah.\nI'm all achy...
I really feel blah.\nWell, I will go home now.
A child like you cannot understand\nthe beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a servant of beauty.\nUgly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I've been looking for...\nis you?
I paint pictures and live with Pokémon.\nI am enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will be a good\nmemory as you grow older.
Experience hardships when you are young,\n'cause old bodies cannot take them.
My schoolkids are sleeping.\nI'm shooting for the top during nap time!
Oh, no!\nLook at the time!
After nap time comes snack time.\nI have to go back to preschool soon.
Life is full of so many farewells,\nso I will enjoy the present.
I cannot see you again,\nso I will do my best.
This is a woman's life.\nCan a baby like you understand it?
If you work diligently,\nyou will get results.
You, keep trying.\nMaster the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently,\nthings don't always go well.
I've arrived from a distant island.\nMay I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I'd be \ngrateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon\nthat my wife is as mad as a hornet.
Pokémon battles are so much fun.\nNo way I can quit.
I don't want to go home, 'cause my wife\nis as scary as a legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary days.\nI gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me\nfrom boring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special person like you,\nI just melt.
I used to be like you.\nI was full of hopes and dreams.
Dreams are important.\nBut if all you have is your dreamworld...
Just having hopes and dreams is not enough.\nWhat is important is... Never mind.
I want to have an exhilarating battle.\nGot it?
Thank you!\nA battle is extremely exhilarating!
OK, OK, I got it...\nLet's call it a day.
It's OK if I have training wheels.\nIt’s OK if my Bike doesn't accelerate.
It's OK if you go your own way.\nYou'll reach your goal someday.
It's OK if you lose.\nIt's OK, 'cause you have a Bicycle.
You ain't never even gonna see\nmy Pokémon's moves.
You're slow, ain't ya?
You're right quick! \nWho are ya, anyways?
I just got married, and we'll be\nexpanding our family soon.
You know what I need.\nCan you spare a few dollars?
Oh, I should really get home,\nbut Pokémon battles are so much fun...
Take a good look\nat this Clerk ♂'s sheer strength!
You got me!\nYou have the best skills in the world!
I put on a smile when I'm crying inside.\nThat's a Clerk ♂'s sad smile.
I will show you the harsh side\nof Pokémon battles.
That's not good.\nI was too generous today.
Did you burn the image of my Pokémon\ninto your mind?
Who do you think I am?\nI am a mighty Policeman!
That's for disobeying me!\nI am a big guy!
You won a battle against a Policeman...\nI will arrest you someday.
It's embarrassing, but I wasn't\nwell behaved when I was young.
You lack energy despite your youth.\nShall I train you?
Good, good. Misbehave while you're still\nyoung and you can get away with it.
Squeak! Squeak, squeak, squeak...\nHm? What? Wanna fight?
You're so impatient.\nI'm still in the middle of my work.
Ohh dear... You tracked dirt\non the floor I just finished cleaning...
There are only two roads in life.\nThe one you like, and the one you hate.
I'll choose the road I like,\neven though it is not the quickest route.
Actually, the road you hate\nmay be the shortcut to your goal.
I am a train.\nI will just run on the tracks.
You are a station where I don't stop.\nI will just pass you by.
I think the train is great, because it runs\nthe same route over and over.
You're good at your job\nand very strong.
I expected too much from you.\nYou are lucky that this is not business.
A person who can juggle\nwork and play is pretty cool.
I've been with these Pokémon\nsince I was a child.
Pokémon are like family to me.
I don't think I want to have children.\nI'd rather focus on my Pokémon family.
Hi, I am a physician!\nHey! Let me give you a shot!
Come now, let me give you a shot!\nDon’t worry. It won't hurt!
You have strong arms!\nSo let me give you a shot now!
Cough! Cough, cough! How many\nmore people will I be able to save?
Cough! I wanted to save more people.\nCough, cough!
Few physicians live well...\nCough! I can't go on any longer...
Do you want a shot?\nOr an IV drip?
You want both a shot and an IV.\nYou are greedy!
Argh. It's sickening!\nYou're such a drip.
In this job,\nI've seen a lot of strange things.
I don't know why, but Ghost-type \nPokémon seem attracted to me.
Ahhh, I lost... By the way,\nwho is that standing behind you?
I have raised them too long.\nThey are beyond my control...
It's over...\nNobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down...\nYou saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon\nyou have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do?\nI expected more from you...
Wow! You are awesome!\nWhat great Pokémon you've trained!
Take a look at these Pokémon--I raised\n'em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon.\nThey're my friends and my treasures.
You are a strong one, sure enuff.\nBut I don't intend to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder.\nI can tame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are very loyal, \naren't they?
They are too attached to me.\nThey are not fit for battling.
Arghhhh! Who is gentle?!\nI will bring you down!
Arghh! Arghh! \nI am NOT a Gentleman!
Arghh! You! You'll regret this!\nI will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once...\nEyes! Aim for the eyes!
What my brother told me was right...\nThanks... Bro...
I lost against a kid. Bro...\nI should have listened to you...
I can't drop my luxurious lifestyle just\nbecause I'm older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child,\nbut money makes the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits\nI learned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer.\nI'll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, bloom, and blossom!\nA woman who flowers and triumphs!
I want to blossom and fall\nrather than dying on the vine.
Hey, it's me. It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in the world!
No! That's no good!\nYou cannot reach the top that way.
Good. You're daring!\nI'll let you come fly on my plane.
Hey! Yo! It's me.\nI am the best Pilot in the world.
Listen! A Trainer should be No. 1.\nThat's it!
You're quite a Trainer!\nBe my apprentice!


















Thank you for riding\nthe Battle Subway today.\r\nI am the Subway Boss Ingo.\c\nI will choose the next destination\nbased on your talent.\c\nDo you understand Pokémon well?\nCan you hold on to your principle?\r\nWill you go on to victory or defeat?\c\nAll aboard!

We make a good two-car train,\nIngo and Emmet.\c\nThis time, we worked together toward\na victory.\c\nHowever, your abilities are\nvery impressive.
Bravo!!\c\nWhat you showed us is\na spark as Trainers.\c\nHowever, let me say just one thing.\c\nWinning against us is a milestone\nin your life.\c\nYou can rack up more and more.\c\nPlease move on toward an even\ngreater goal!

I am Emmet.\c\nI lost together with Ingo.\c\nYour combination is\nthe best, perfect!\r\nYou're verrrrry strong Trainers.\c\nYup! It was so much fun!

We, Ingo and Emmet, are a\ntwo-car train.\c\nThis time, we were able to work toward\na victory.\c\nWell, will you stop here?\nOr will you challenge us again?\c\nIt's up to you.\nBut let me say one thing.\c\nThere is no terminal called End\nin your life!
Bravo!!\nReally excellent!\c\nThe best combination of\nyou and your Pokémon.\r\nIt is incredible!\c\nWhen you and someone else combine,\nyour engine powers something special!\c\nIf you like, please challenge us\nwith a different combination.
What I do. What I say.\nAlways the same.\c\nFollow the rules.\nSafe driving!\c\nFollow the schedules.\nEveryone smile!\c\nCheck safety.\nEverything's ready!\c\nAim for victory!\nAll aboard!
I am Emmet.\c\nWe won, but\nI am not really satisfied.\c\nI can tell that you won't give up.\nBecause you will be much, much stronger.\c\nThat's why we are waiting\nfor you to come back!

A Trainer catches another Trainer's eye.\nThat is the start of a Pokémon battle!\c
What?!\nYou are too strong!
I'll go into the tall grass and\nhave battles with wild Pokémon!\c\nBut, before that, I have to visit\nthe Pokémon Center to heal up my team.
I really love Pokémon battles!\c\n'Cause my cute Pokémon will do its best\nin a really cute way!\c
Even though it lost,\nmy Pokémon is still cute!
I'll make my cute Pokémon even stronger\nby having battles with lots of Trainers!
Lillipup, Lillipup!\nMy Lillipup! Go!\c
Your Pokémon uses those kinds of moves?!
Different Trainers use\ndifferent kinds of Pokémon!\r\nThat's fun to see, isn't it?
Check out how much my Pokémon\nhave grown up!\c
Oh. I guess they're still pretty green.
You are great!\nThis is a present for you.\c
Thank you very much.\c\nI learned a lot about how I should\ntrain my Pokémon from battling you.
Your Pokémon look quite good!\c\nWould you show me how\nyou've been training them?\c
Oh, I see!\nYou've trained them by traveling together!
Please, let your precious Pokémon\nhave this.\c
I guess when Pokémon and Trainers\nspend that much time together,\r\nthey naturally understand each other!
I feel invincible because I am surrounded\nby the smiles of children and Pokémon!\c
Wow! Great, great!\nYou are very strong!
Speak while making eye contact, and\nexpress your feelings to each other...\r\nIt's the same for people and Pokémon.

Kumi: Come on, Pokémon! Get up! Go!\nAmy: Oh, no! Our Pokémon burned out...

Eh? Only one Pokémon?\nAre you really a Trainer?



You have only one Pokémon?\nAre you really a Trainer?
Hey! Trainer!\nHave a battle with me!\c
Oops. I have no healthy Pokémon\nleft to fight...
Argh! You went all out against a kid!\n...Actually, that's a good thing. Thanks!
Take this!\nHyper Beam!\c
Whoops...
Hyper Beam?\nOh, my Pokémon can't really use it yet.\c\nI don't know very much about Pokémon,\nso I just want to use really cool moves.
Trainer! \nI wanna play with you.\c
Trainer!\nYou too strong!
When I get big, I wanna be\na strong, cool Trainer, too!
Now I get to show off everything\nI learned in the Trainers' School!\c
Argh...
I was so overwhelmed by your greatness\nthat I forgot everything I learned!\r\nI need to keep my wits during a battle.
I was just thinking\nabout a new battle strategy!\c
A new battle strategy only works\nif you stick with it...
I know all kinds of things! Like if you\nwalk through the swaying tall grass,\r\nyou might find a cool Pokémon!
Even if Pokémon have not been fully\ntrained, they can show their potential\r\ndepending on their Trainer's style.\c
Oh, that's really frustrating!
I feel sorry for Pokémon when they lose\nbecause their Trainer lacks skill...\r\nA Trainer has a huge responsibility.
The fun of traveling around the world\nis having serious battles\r\nwith a lot of Pokémon I meet!\c
Wooo! You're a top-class Trainer,\nthe best in the world!\r\n...But what do I know?
As long as my Pokémon are with me,\nI can battle Trainers all over the world!\c\nThe world is so big! Woooooo!\nThat's really exciting!
Where did you come from?\nMe? Well, if you can win, I'll tell you!\c
My first battle...\nAnd I lost...
To tell you the truth,\nI just left Castelia City yesterday.\r\nI've just started Pokémon battling, too.
I'm still a rookie, but someday\nI will be a great player!\c\nI'll improve by having a lot\nof Pokémon battles!\c
Ugh!\nI missed the rebound!
I won't make excuses for losing!\c\nWhy waste time dreaming up excuses?\nI'll spend that time getting stronger!
A young Trainer! It's important for the\nyoung to get lots of exercise, isn't it?\c
A good sweat...\nBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
I want a Poké Ball that's\nas big as a basketball!\c\nI think it would be more comfortable\nfor the Pokémon inside it.
You've been caught by a powerful hook,\nwhich is me!\c\nI'll have a battle with you using\nmy freshly caught Pokémon!\c
Oh, no! The one who was caught...\nwas me!
I usually release the Pokémon I catch.\nThat's called catch and release!\r\nWhen I release them, I say these words:\c\nFarewell, Pokémon.\nIt was a nice fight.\c\nI'll say these words to you, too.\nIt was a nice fight!
OK! Good catch! Good catch!\nMy next catch will be called victory!\c
The victory that got away\nwas thiiiiiiiiiis big!
Catch, caught, and catch again...\nLife is fishing!
Ho there! Even in the middle of\nconstruction, a Trainer will battle.\c
Gah! I'm digging myself into a big hole!
If you use a Pokémon move called Dig,\nyou can get out of a cave instantly!
I'm a mucho macho Worker!\nI'll bring you down with my muscles!\c
Argh!\nThe impudence!
I dismissed you as just a kid...\nNot at all... You're quite a Trainer!
A battle is like a construction project.\nThey're both a piece of cake for me!\c
Ooh... That piece of cake was\nhard to swallow!
I may have lost in the battle, but I bow\nto nobody when it comes to construction!\c\nYou must have something like that, right?\nSomething you do better than anybody?
We've trained by doing physical work!\nOur attacks are super powerful!\c
We've trained by doing physical work.\nSo even when we lose, we're powerful!
This Worker is happy to have a job that\nlets him be with his favorite Pokémon!
Hi, Trainer!\nLet me turn you into a work of art!\c
Oh, I just got whitewashed!
The reason why there are so many colors\nin this world...white, black, red, green,\r\nblue, yellow...is that they can be mixed\r\nto create an explosion of new color!\c\nBoom!
As my mind roams, as the wind blows,\ndestiny has brought us to this battle.\c
Urgh... I didn't know\nI was flying against the wind...
I want to fly around the Unova region,\nblown by the wind!
This big bag...\nWhat do you think is inside?\c
I lost, but now I have more things\nto add to my bag.
I'll tell you a secret. The things I put\nin the bag are memories of my journey!\c\nThe things you can't see are very heavy!
These Pokémon usually help me bake.\nToday, they'll help me battle you!\c
Oh, my...\nIt was a tasty battle.
I get on well with my Pokémon, and we\nbake bread together. It's so much fun!\r\nI don't mind getting up early every day.
Turn around, and it's my turn. ♪\nTurn around, and it's your turn.\c
Turn around, turn around, turn around...
It's difficult to have a battle while\ntapping my toes.\c\nBut I am a Dancer!\nIt is natural to dance!
I will show you all the moves\nthat my Pokémon have mastered!\c
I am sorry that I underestimated\nyou and your Pokémon's moves!
Sometimes a battle is so beautiful\nthat it takes your breath away.\c\nOurs was such a battle!
It is best to try anything!\nYou think so, too, don't you?\c
There's a rhythm to attacking\nand defending...\r\nI think ours got thrown off.
The guitar is expression itself.\c\nLet's enjoy playing the guitar,\nrather than just talking about it!\c\nA Pokémon is also expression itself.\nLet's enjoy battling!
I cannot see the future yet...\nThe world is still to be determined...
Plasmaaaa!\n...What? Did we lose?
I cannot believe that Team Plasma\nlost to such kids!
I've finally become a Trainer...\nEverything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying\nPokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...\nEverything starts from here!

Eek! Ouch!\nI won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and\nthis isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!

More!\nLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I never expected to hear\nPokémon say such things...
My Psychic-type Pokémon\njust started making noises.\c\nIs that because we're in the ruins...\nor is it because of you?\c
So...strong!\nWho are you?!
It is said that long ago, these ruins\nwere the heart of civilization for people\r\nand Pokémon in the Unova region.
Just being here fills me\nwith magical power...\c
You seem to be\nfull of magical power, too...
In ancient places,\nmagical energy remains...\c\nI can understand it.\nSo much sorrow and joy...
As if that would work on my Pokémon!
It's not over yet! One more left!\nThis is where I give it my all!
You got me.\c\nI am...burned...out...
I see...\nThat might be a good attack.
I'll put all of my hopes\non my last Pokémon!
Lose? Me?\nI don't believe this.
Ah!\nMy Pokémon!
Huh? Could it be?\nCould I have only one Pokémon left?
Er...\nIs it over now?
Welcome to Striaton Gym!\c\nCare for a taste of battle?\nI'll serve up the first course!\c
Yow!\nYou're a Trainer with a lot of pepper!
I think it is all right to move ahead\nwith Pokémon you've trained well, even\r\nwithout thinking about type matchups.
The specialty of Striaton Gym--\nthe full-course “Trainer de luxe!"\r\nI'm your second course.\c
That was one of our most popular dishes.\nDid you enjoy the battle?
The specialty of Striaton Gym--\nthe full-course “Trainer de luxe!"\r\nTo complete your repast--a Gym Leader.
Now, with that move, I'm starting to see\nwhat kind of Trainer you are!
No matter how grim the situation, I'll use my\nresearch skills to find a winning strategy!
My theory about you was correct.\c\nYou're more than just talented...\nYou're motivated! I salute you!
I hang around Nacrene Gym all the time.\nPeople call me a bookworm.\c\nI'll warn you now... I am strong because\nI spend the entire day either\r\nreading books or training Pokémon.\c
I may be a bookworm,\nbut I am not a bug Pokémon.
My first recommendation is a book called\n“Nice to Meet You, Pokémon."\c\nThe bookshelves for children's books\nare close to the entrance.
Oh, wow!\nI lost, but thanks for a great battle!
I've never known anyone so powerful.\nMy head is empty compared to yours!
Snick!\nMy switch was turned on!
Could it be time to bug out of here?\nNo, no. I refuse to be squashed!
Is it over?\nHas my muse abandoned me?
You and your Pokémon...\nare shining brilliantly!
A properly dramatic victory requires\na dash of danger and a pinch of peril.
I meant to make your head spin,\nbut you shocked me instead.
Even though I lost,\nI'm an ocean of calm...
Welcome, challenger!\c\nI will do you the greatest of honors\nand accept your challenge!\c
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll on!\nRoller coaster!
I was aiming for a fighting style\nthat overwhelms you with speed...\c\nIf I can move faster than my opponents,\nI will get the upper hand.
I lost, but I will think a lot harder,\nand that will make me a lot stronger!
Your fashion sense...\nIt's kind of Nuvema Town-ish.\c
Oh, no!\nI thought I'd be the fashionista!
Elesa controls an elegant Gym\nin elegant Nimbasa City.\r\nShe has an essential elegance.\r\nYou should be her fan, too!
I'll be!\nSure didn't see that coming.
Givin' up's the easy way out! If I wanted,\nI could have given up any old time!
Well, I've had enough... And just so you\nknow, I didn't go easy on you.
When I think about a match\nwith a fabulous Trainer like you,\r\nit's like I'm walking on air!
This is my last Pokémon...\nBut I'll never give up hope!
Being your opponent in battle is a new\nsource of strength to me. Thank you!
I became a Pilot, which has been\nmy dream since I was a child.\r\nI am extremely strong! Bring it on!\c
Altitude is dropping slowly...\nI will prepare for landing.
I became a Pilot, making the dream\nof my younger days a reality...\r\nThe weight is quite comfortable.
Target lock acquired!\c\nI will shoot you down\nwith my flight technique!\c
What?!\nI missed the target.
We can depend on a move that\nhits without fail when it counts.\c\nFor example, Aerial Ace and Swift\nare both surefire moves!
The best Trainer of Ice-type Pokémon\nin the Cold Storage...\r\nThat's me!\c
Oh, no... I will train even harder\nat the Icirrus Gym.
The Gym Leader in Icirrus City\nuses Ice-type Pokémon!\c\nIf you train your body and mind there,\nyou'll be fine with cold!
The pure chill of the Cold Storage!\nTaste how cold it is!\c
Chilly?\nI feel the shiver pass along my spine.
There are a lot of Trainers,\neven in the Cold Storage.



We!\nWe are training here!\c\nNow let's train\nPokémon together!\c
Great!\nYou have a talent as a Trainer!
I want to win against Gym Leaders,\nbut I want to win against you, too!
My goal is to outperform Gym Leaders!\nCan you win against me?!\c
My Pokémon fought well, didn't they?
I have my goal!\nMy Pokémon are there for me!\r\nThat's why I can keep trying!
POWER!\c\nPower is essential for both\nPokémon and football!\c
Didn't I have enough power...?
I am training to be the very best\nwith my Pokémon!
An elegant Smasher\nhas an elegant battle!\c
E-e-even though I lost,\nI won't panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't\nbe chagrined at losing the battle!
The qualifying round is coming soon.\c\nI will practice smashes\nby using you as a wall!\c
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\nThat was some good training...
You and I have just met!\nLet's start this game from the beginning.
One-two, one-two! Keep time with\neach other, and one-two punch!\c
Mayo: Two of us keeping time together...\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\c\nMay: Two of us keeping time together...\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
It would be even greater if we knew\nwhat two Pokémon will do.
You've got only one Pokémon,\nso we cannot fight.
We discuss what to do\nbefore a battle.\c

What I've heard is it's good to use\nEarthquake when your ally is floating!
If you want to have a battle with us, \nyou need two Pokémon.
...Interrupting us!\nWhat a horrible Trainer!
If you take something away,\nI will take it back... Remember that!
Look, look! This is a Gym Badge\nfrom Striaton City!\c\nOh, you have it, too!\nThen let's have a Pokémon battle\r\nto see who is stronger!\c
Impressive! A battle with a\nGym Badge holder is different!
You know, there's a pedestal at the\nentrance of each Pokémon Gym.\c\nIf you get that Gym's Badge,\nyour name will be carved there.
I patrol Pinwheel Forest every day!\nA battle here is a piece of cake!\c
What a huge mistake to lose\na battle in Pinwheel Forest!
A Ranger always has one of these.\nI'll give it to you!\c
The forest is alive...\c\nSomething changes every day,\nso it's fun to patrol!
Blend into the wilderness\nand talk to Pokémon with your heart.\r\nThat is a Ranger!\c
Did you feel my wildness?
I'm sure you can fully\nutilize this.\c
If you blend into the wilderness too well,\nyou won't be noticed by Pokémon,\r\nlet alone by people.\r\nThat is a problem...
Come on! Let's take\na deep breath.\c\nInhale, exhale.\nInhale, exhale.\c\nAll right! Next,\nlet our Pokémon fight!\c
In this situation...\nAll that comes out is a sigh...
Well, a sigh and this lovely gift for you!\c
Different Pokémon can be found\nin different places.\c\nDoes that mean there is\na perfect place for everyone?
Get great powers drawn from nature\nwithout opposing it.\r\nThat is the strength of Rangers!\c
You and your Pokémon make a great team!
This is one of the powers\nI got from nature.\c
Even the things you can't do alone,\nif you're with someone else...\c\nThat's right. We always\nhave Pokémon around us.\r\nIsn't that great?
Why do Pokémon and people\nstay together...?\r\nThat's the theme of my research.\c
A ray of light shone in...\nI feel a little like that.
Why do Pokémon and people\nstay together...?\c\nI think we stick together\nbecause we are different.
If I apply what I just learned\nto the battle, I think I can win!\c
I've even won against my teacher, though...
Knowing something and being\nable to do it seem pretty similar,\r\nbut they can be very different.
My Pokémon's strong points!\nYou'll see them if you fight!\c
Hey! Did you see\nmy Pokémon's strong points?!
My Pokémon's strong points?\c\nHmmm...\c\nI don't know 'cause there are too many!
When it's cold, wear a lot of clothes!\c\nOnly humans could come up\nwith something so clever!\c
How we struggle in vain at the end\nalso shows how clever humans are!
I'll tell you something clever.\c\nIf you use a Fire-type move on a Pokémon\nthat is frozen solid, the ice will melt!
Although I am in the Cold Storage,\nmy heart is burning!\c
Oh, no!
Some Pokémon grow stronger\nwhen they get colder,\r\nwhile some Pokémon love hot places.\c\nThat's right! Everyone is different!\nEvery Pokémon is different!
You're pretty energetic,\nconsidering the cold place we're in!\c\nLet's warm up with a Pokémon battle!\c
I warmed up, but I lost the battle,\nand my heart is freezing...
I am storing thick fat\nto resist the cold.\c\n...I didn't just get fat.\nPlease don't get me wrong.
...\c\n...R-ready to b-battle?\c
...\c\n...I'm sh-shivering!
...\c\n...Kn-know what?\n...Th-this place is cold.

I may have been traveling\nto meet you... Just kidding!
My journey taught me that a journey\nis not just going somewhere.\c\nMeeting people and learning from them\nare both part of my journey.
I wanted to go to the Celestial Tower...\nbut I got lost and stranded.\c
Ah! I cannot go anywhere\nif I am stopping!
To go to the Celestial Tower...\c\nWalk along the road! That's right!\c\nIf you keep walking, someday\nyou'll arrive at your destination.
Oh! A Pokédex!\c\nI see. That is the reason\nfor your journey!\c
Impressive! That's what you'd expect\nfrom the owner of a Pokédex!
I've heard that both Professor Junipers\nwere Backpackers when they were young.
My travel partner is a Pokémon\nthat a popular guidebook recommended!\c
The guidebook does not tell me\nhow to win.
According to the popular guidebook,\nNimbasa City is an entertainment city.\r\nIt must be full of fun!
Do you want to pass through here?\c\nThen, you must greet me!\c
You!!\nWhat great strength you have!
For a child like you, \na Bicycle is just right!\r\nIt is healthier, isn't it?
Heheh!\nNobody can beat my speed and fury!\c
I have lost!\nI am such a loser!
Ah! I wish I could fly down\na much, much bigger road.\r\nThe Pokémon would be happy, too!
Hey, hey, what have we here, boys?\c\nYou have good Pokémon.\nLet me see!\c
Jim: G-good Pokémon.\nTo be honest, they are dazzling!\c\nCas: WHAT?\nHow could bad men like us lose...?
There are good Pokémon,\nbut there are no bad Pokémon.\c\nEverything is up to the Trainer.\nThat's what I think!
You've got only one Pokémon?\nA single battle is so boring!
Hey, hey! A bad one teamed up\nwith another bad one!\c\nDo you know what it means?\c\nThat means we are very bad!\c

Even bad men like us\ncan be friends!\c\nWhat a great thing!\nFriendship between men\r\nand friendship with Pokémon...
What? You've only got one\nPokémon that can fight?\c\nI cannot take a cheap shot,\nfighting two against one!
I'm a little bit strong.\nI will work out!\c
I got worked over...
You're quite strong.\nYou have left the Little League!
Hey!\nHey, let's practice together!\c\nI have to warn you--I will go all out\neven if we are just practicing!\c
I was no match for you...\nThere is always someone better.
I promise you!\c\nI will learn from this experience\nand become an even better player!
There is no end\nto mastering Pokémon battles!\c
There is an end\nfor this battle!
It's hard to have no end,\nbut if you change your perspective,\r\nyou'll see we can enjoy them forever!
I want to know how\nthe fighting Pokémon feel.\c\nThat's why I fight, too.\nThat's me, a Battle Girl!\c
When I lose, I cry with my Pokémon!\nThat's me, a Battle Girl!
When you train every day,\nyour body moves as you like.\r\nIt feels really good!
I test the challenge rock\nwith my fist every day!\c\nIt is important to make steady progress,\nlittle by little.\c
I still have not\ntried hard enough!
I test the challenge rock every day\nwith my Pokémon!\c\nWhy don't you check out\nthe challenge rock\r\nwith a Fighting-type Pokémon?
I am pleased to meet you.\c\nPlease allow me to introduce you\nto my Pokémon.\c
I had the honor of meeting\nyour Pokémon!
Well, well, you are strong!\nI admire you.\r\nI would like to learn by watching you!
Clerks exchange business cards.\c\nTrainers, of course, greet each other\nwith a Pokémon battle!\c
What an impressive greeting!\nThat was a great Pokémon battle!
When I was a child,\nI traveled with Pokémon...\c\nOf course, I am still raising Pokémon!\n'Cause Pokémon are my friends for life!
My work is a Pokémon battle!\c
Today's work\ndidn't go well...
Our company develops goods\nfor Pokémon and Trainers.\c\nSo, Pokémon battles are also\nan important part of my work!
I received intense training from Clay.\c\nNo Trainer around here\nis out of my league.\c
Oh, no...\nI've found someone who's out of my league!
Clay is a Gym Leader and\na company president.\r\nAnd he scolds me all the time.
I was about to take a break,\nthen I met you!\c
This encounter was a good one...\nfor you!
I met my Pokémon\nmore than ten years ago.\r\nI trust them.
Even the battle I lost\nwill be a bittersweet memory...
Wow, you really cleaned up!
When Pokémon Trainers meet,\nwhat we do is, of course,\r\nengage in a Pokémon battle, don't we?\c
Oh no...\nI'm pathetic...
Perhaps I meet people here because of\nguidance from my Pokémon.
Oh?\nYou want to have a battle with me?\c\nAll right!\nI have a strong Pokémon.\c
That's right.\nThe Pokémon is no longer with me.
...The Pokémon is no longer with me.\c\n...That's not true.\nAs long as I remember,\r\nit will be with me forever.
If you like, I will make\nyour Pokémon healthy!\c\nHowever! Let me challenge you\nto a battle first!\c
What? \nDid MY Pokémon lose energy?
Now, as I promised,\nI will make your Pokémon healthy.\c
To make people healthy,\nDoctors go where they are needed.
During a long journey,\nyou'll be happy if you meet a Doctor.\c\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\c
Your team is very healthy. Let me\njust fix your team up a little bit...
After a Pokémon battle,\nlet them recover slowly.\c
Health is always crucial!\nIt really is.
I've survived a lot of fierce battles\nwith my Pokémon!\c\nI don't think I will lose!\c
The one who survived\nfierce battles was you?!
My heart is not broken.\c\nI will survive further fierce battles\nwith my Pokémon,\r\nand I will become much stronger.
Take this!\nThe winning strategy I've developed!\c
Sigh...\nI feel down.
I feel down only briefly!\c\nI am a Trainer. If I give up,\nmy Pokémon cannot do anything! Right?
I will test you to see whether\nyou have what it takes...\c\nto aim for the Pokémon League!\c
I see! I see, I see!\nI see, I see, I see, I see!
They say that there is a strong Champion\nin the Pokémon League.\c\nSomeday, I will be able to challenge\nthe Pokémon League!
I am an Ace Trainer!\nBasically, I am very strong.\c\nThe Unova region will be shaken\nif I lose.\c
...The meaning of my existence\nis being threatened right now!
Someday, your existence will shake\nthis Unova region!\c\nMy loss looks more impressive\nif I praise you as a hotshot.
Hey! My Pokémon are great.\nLook, look!\c
Argh!
I am called an Ace Trainer, but\nthat doesn't sit well with me.\c\n'Cause I just love Pokémon,\nand I just want to be strong!
Even at an electrified place like this,\nif somebody challenges me,\r\nI will take that challenge.\r\nThat is an Ace Trainer!\c
Hmmm...\nI am electrified!
Bits of knowledge about electricity!\c\nAn electric current runs from plus\nto minus, and an electron runs\r\nfrom minus to plus.
I'm really serious about training.\c\nI even visit this electrified cave\nto train myself and my Pokémon!\c
The electric shock racing...\nMe falling down...
Some Pokémon like to live\nin this electrified cave...\c\nDon't you think that people\nshould stay out?
I've improved my ability\nby fighting strong opponents,\r\ncatching them, and overtaking them!\c\nYou're strong!\nI'll overtake you at all costs!\c
I was far from catching up with you...\nYou are no ordinary person!!
No time to feel down after a defeat!\c\nIf moaning over a loss made me strong,\nI would bemoan a loss forever, though.
What pleases sleeping spirits\nis a hot Pokémon battle!\c
It's a spark of your flaming spirit!
When I come here... At Celestial Tower,\nstrangely, I feel the urge to fight.\c\nDoes that prove I am alive?
I'm here to understand the end\nof the world, but I don't quite get it.\c\nIf I have a battle,\nwill I be enlightened...?\c
The end...\nIs that it?
People, Pokémon...\nEven if the world is gone,\r\nthat is not the end.\r\nI feel sure of it.
Indescribable energy\nis flowing to me!\c
The energy is escaping...\nAww...
A lot of energies are swirling\naround in the world,\r\nincluding hopes and dreams.
...I still want to fight!\nWandering spirits command me!\c
Lemme breathe a sec...\nThe spirits have calmed down a bit.
In a way...the Celestial Tower\nis a space full of desires to live.
Watching a practice makes you feel\nthat you are stronger, too,\r\ndoesn't it?\r\nSo let's have a battle!\c
Hawk: ...I could not\ndo it well at all.\c\nDar: ...I could not\ndo it right at all.
They can do even the hardest things\nas if they were so simple...\c\nThat's the great thing\nabout professionals.
We cannot have\na one-on-two battle.
We were watching various team sports,\nand we wanted to fight as a duo, too!\c

Playing as a team is difficult.\c\nWe could do more great things\nif we could understand what\r\nother people were thinking!
We would like to have\na Pokémon battle as a duo.
I get excited just by\ncoming to this stadium!!\c
Joe: I got super excited!\c\nRoss: What a thrill!\nIt's taking my breath away!
Just by being here! Just by watching it!\nI get really excited!\c\nIf I played a game here,\nI would be extremely excited!
We don't want to have\na one-on-two battle.
If we fight in this stadium,\ndon't you think we will understand\r\nhow our star players feel?\c

We had a battle with Pokémon\nin the stadium...\c\nI am happy 'cause I experienced\nwhat star players feel!
One-on-two? \nWe cannot fight like that.
Watching people practicing\nmakes me want to get moving, too!\c\nSoooooo, let's practice\nPokémon battles.\c
Masa: I laugh even though\nwe lost because it was fun!\c\nYas: Ah! I didn't cheer enough\nfor our Pokémon.
It's way more fun to have a battle\nourselves than watching\r\nother people practicing!
We cannot have\na one-on-two battle.
We usually cheer for other people,\nbut today we would like\r\nto gather our courage\r\nand have our own Pokémon battle.\c

I am not good at sports,\nbut I enjoy sports in my own way--\r\nby cheering my heart out for people!
You have only one Pokémon\nthat can fight. It's out of the question.
Watching athletes practice with Pokémon\nmade me want to have a Pokémon battle.\c
Kay: Great!\nYou are like a professional!\c\nAli: How did you know?
Ohhh... I knew it was difficult\nto fight with Pokémon as well as\r\nthe professionals do.
We are two!\nWe use two Pokémon, too!
Pokémon do\nwhat I cannot do.\c\nYou know how wonderful this is,\ndon't you?\c

Even existing sports shine\nwith new appeal\r\nwhen they team up with Pokémon!
Aren't you in trouble if you don't have\nmore Pokémon that can fight?
Which do you like better,\ntennis or basketball?\c
Ami: The game ended\nbefore I knew what was going on.\c\nEira: The combination of you\nand your Pokémon is great!
I love both tennis and basketball!\c\nI can't choose just one of them, just\nlike I can't choose my favorite Pokémon.
What? You have only one\nPokémon that can fight?
We are always together!\nOur combination play must be great!\c

Be in sync with your partner,\nand with your Pokémon, too.\r\nTag Battles are tough!\c\nBut if you are in sync,\nit will be very exciting!
You have only one\nhealthy Pokémon...?
Real Fishermen are impatient!\nSo we must battle immediately!\c
I lost!\nIt's the end!!
How do I know that real Fishermen\nare so impatient?\c\nBecause we change places frantically\nif we cannot catch Pokémon!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\nphysical therapy for me and my Pokémon!\c
My tackle was supposed to crush\neven Rock-type Pokémon...
I was injured in a rough game, so\nI am undergoing some physical therapy.
Join our team!\c\nActually, I will force you\nto join our team!\c
Our team doesn't need a Trainer\nwho is quite that strong!
We are cooooool!\nWe hang out here every day!
If I win, give me your Pokémon!\c
That was just a joke.\nYou didn't have to take it so seriously!
Bah! I haven't fallen so low\nthat I would steal somebody's Pokémon\r\nlike Team Plasma!
Mua-ha-ha! I will leave here\nfor Victory Road.\r\nIt's my hobby to win against Trainers!\c
I can't believe this!
Rather than enjoying defeating someone,\nshould I aim higher...?\c\nI guess the Pokémon League is the place\nto find a better class of challengers.
Words are unnecessary!\nI can understand everything if we battle.\c
...
Though people and Pokémon\ncannot communicate with words,\r\nwe can communicate with our hearts!
I trained and trained like a madman,\nand my Pokémon trained even more!\c
Yeah! Yeah!\nEven though I lost, I'm energetic!
My Fighting-type Pokémon!\nI train it to smash the challenge rock!
You are strong!\nNo, both you and your Pokémon are strong!
Extreme conditions\nreally test you and train you!
The wonderful combination\nof you and your Pokémon!\r\nWhat a beautiful friendship!
The pain of my Pokémon...\nI feel it, too!
No! Not yet!\nNo! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...\nI did my best, but we lost...
I didn't see that coming.\nYou are a very difficult opponent.
Now is the moment of truth!\nThis really gets my blood pumping!
This intense feeling that floods\nme after a defeat...\r\nI don't know how to describe it.
Meow, meow, meow!\c\nThis sign means\nhave a battle with me!\c
Thank you for having a battle\nwith me!
Meow, meow, meow!\c\nI am copying the Pokémon\nI used to live with.
Victory Road!\c\nI'll test myself by fighting against you\nto see if I am ready to climb it!\c
Agh...\nWas it too early for me?!
Victory Road!\nIt is really amazing!\c\nThat's the road to\nthe Pokémon League!
I'm a Hiker exploring caves.\nI will teach you the harshness of life\r\nand the difficulty of Pokémon battles.\c
Well...\nGuess I'll take a hike.
In the caves...\nPokémon lurk in the piles of dirt!
Conquering a mountain means\nconquering your fears!\c\nCan you win against Pokémon\nthat have conquered many mountains?\c
You conquered a B-list mountain.\nThat B-lister is me!
Hikers aim at summits.\c\nPokémon Trainers aim\nfor the Pokémon League!
You need a Nurse's help?\c\nSure, if you can win against me,\nI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\c
Come on!\nYour team is really healthy!
OK! Then...\nTime to give your Pokémon some energy!\c
It's wonderful that each Pokémon and\neach person can do something special!\c\nMe, I know how to make Pokémon healthy!
Welcome to the Battle Company!\nSince you are here, battle with me.\r\nI won't take no for an answer!\c
Oh, dear. Aren't you being\ntoo hard on me?
In the Battle Company, the stronger you\nare, the higher the floor you work on.
Hee hee! I am better at Pokémon battles\nthan I am at work!\c
I'm good at Pokémon, but I still lost!
A competent woman is\nas good at Pokémon battles\r\nas she is at her work!
Clay is at the bottom of the Gym,\nbut I will test you to see\r\nwhether you are skilled enough\r\nto face the Gym Leader.\c
Agh, so frustrating!\nMaybe I'm not skilled enough...
I started Pokémon battles\nafter I grew up,\r\nbut I got so into it!
Pouring rain... ♪\nFighting Pokémon... ♪\c
Ah, hear the sad melody\nof a total defeat...
Rain is a wonderful melody\nthat nature plays! ♪
Water fun with Pokémon!\nDo you want to play with us?\c
Uh-oh... I lost.\nBut it was fun, so I'm satisfied.
Aquatic sports with Pokémon!\nNothing is more fun than that!\c\nIt's 100% impossible to live\nwithout Pokémon.
The splish-splosh sounds! Those were\nyour footsteps, weren't they?\r\nSo cute!\c
You are so strong--too strong to be cute!
According to footstep fortune-telling...\c\nThose whose footsteps make a splish and\na splosh are Trainers that Pokémon like.
If you turn a parasol around,\nit's like a flower blossoming in the rain!\c
Ack...\nCome on!
On rainy days, use a parasol,\nwear a coat, or get wet.\r\nDo as you like!
I am a Rich Boy,\nso I have a great Pokémon!\c
I am a Rich Boy. Even though I lost,\nI'm not frustrated! Bah!
I am a Rich Boy. I will go on a shopping\nspree to make myself feel better!
Even when I am resting from\ntoo much shopping, I'm willing to battle!\c
Oh, no! I'm still the one to beat\nin shopping competitions, though!
I'm very rich, but even I am\npleased with the selection\r\nat this shopping mall. I want to buy more!
I will show you how energetic\nI've become just by being here!\c
Naaatuuure!
If I use this, will my Pokémon\nalso become energetic?\c
When we are surrounded by green,\nwe feel more energetic. Don't you think?\r\nThank you, Mother Nature!
We are totally in sync!\c\nUsing our amazing connection,\nI will teach you all about Rangers!\c
In fact, we learned\nall about you!
Do you know much\nabout this Berry?\c
Listen carefully...\c\nYou may hear the sound\nof breathing Pokémon and plants.
Mother Nature changes her look\naccording to the seasons...\r\nThat's something I cherish!\c
OK!\nYou seem to cherish nature!
When seasons change,\nMother Nature gives us this.\c
Nature changes,\nand Pokémon evolve...\c\nHow can people change?
It takes 20 or even 30 years\nfor a tree to be fully grown!\c\nWill you have a Pokémon battle\nthat pleases the trees?\c
I did my best...\nI am satisfied!
This is what a tree gave me!\c
It's a slow business,\ngrowing a tree.\c\nNo need to rush.\nRaise strong Pokémon slowly.
I'll show you our style.\nMy Pokémon and nature are in harmony.\c
Wasn't our style worthy?
What do you let your Pokémon have?\nWhat is their style?\c
First, we'll create our own style!\c\nBecause I am hopeless\nat social niceties and fashions!
It blends in among the trees and grass,\nand it shows its strength.\r\nSee the strength of my Pokémon!\c
What I wanted to see\nwas not YOUR strength...
This is what Pokémon love.\nHere, take some!\c
There is nature and there are cities,\nand it's lovely to have the choice.\c\nBoth people and Pokémon\ncan choose their favorite places!
Hm! You are an interesting case!\nPlease help me with my experiment!\c
Hm-hum! It's difficult to get a result\nwith this method.
When the wind blows, seeds fly.\c\nWhen seeds fly, flowers bloom.\c\nWhen the flowers bloom, we'll get seeds.\c\nEverything is connected!
Just because I am a Scientist,\npeople think I am so serious!\c
Shocking! Nooooo waaaay!\nI loooooost!
To turn a ridiculous idea\ninto a reality...\c\nScience can make much more happen\nthan everyone thinks!
Oh! An unfamiliar face!\c\nTo help scientific progress,\nplease lend me a hand!\c
Instead of lending a hand,\nyou gave me a workout!
I don't know if science will make everyone\nhappy, but if I believe it will, that\r\nhelps me do my best. That's a fact.
I want to solve!\c\nAll the mysteries!\c\nIn the world!\c\nFor that purpose! I will keep fighting!\c
Whether I win or lose!\nMysteries only deepen!
I don't think I can solve\nall mysteries by myself!\c\nHowever! If I can discover something new\nand help someone, I will be satisfied!
I've found a wonderful Trainer!\nI will research you immediately!\c
The results of my research have revealed\nthat you are the best!
It is very exciting\nto unlock the secrets\r\nof Pokémon and their Trainers.
I love this place! The electricity\ncharges up my inspiration!\c
Aha!  \nThat made a light bulb go on in my head!
When a person moves,\nelectric signals travel in the body!\c\nAlso, when a person has an inspiration,\nelectric signals travel to the brain!
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I must still be green!\nI have plenty of guts, though!
Both my Pokémon and I\nstill haven't gotten enough practice...\r\nIn terms of levels, that would be five...
I am about to give a lecture\non the strength created by gathering\r\na proper balance of different Pokémon!\c
Bam! You lectured me!\nWhat a great Trainer!
Team play with Pokémon\nbrought new fun to our sport.
My dad is working in a Gym!\nI am receiving special training there!\c
...Dad.\n...I couldn't win.
I have Pokémon battles with my dad, too.\nMy dad and I are quite evenly matched!
Workers carry Pokémon and loads.\nI am a Youngster.\c\nI am close to my Pokémon,\nand we all cooperate happily!\c
Ummmm! You're closer\nto your Pokémon than I am!
It never occurred to you that\nthe Pokémon you find around containers\r\ncame here from another place?
Sometimes you find more than just strong\nPokémon in the tall grass!\c
Strooooong!\nWhat a Trainer!!
I will grow better and better\nby fighting Pokémon in the tall grass!
Oh!\c\nOhhh?\c\nWhat?! That's not a Pokémon,\njust an ordinary Trainer!\c
You are not an ordinary Trainer.\nYou are a strong Trainer!!
Have you heard that when tall grass\nwaves in the breeze,\r\na rare Pokémon jumps out?
These are special Pokémon\nI just caught!\c
I just caught them\nand have not raised them yet!
OK! I will catch some different Pokémon\nin Pinwheel Forest and have more friends!
OK! I'm brave and I'm bold!\nLet's get right to the battle!\c
Pfft...\nMy bold bravery is vanishing into the air...
I will tell you 'cause you're strong!\c\nOnly one piece of the challenge rock\nwill be chipped off each day!
I wanted to captivate you,\nbut I feel like I slipped and fell!
I've seen a lot of Trainers!\c\nYou seem to have the same aura\nthat I felt from strong Trainers.\c
Exactly!\nYour aura is exactly what I felt!
You have abundant kindness\nas well as strength.
I'm the best around here.\nCan you possibly be a match for me?\c
Your talent and sense...\nBoth are dazzling.
Perhaps the secret of your strength\nis your commitment.
I am a Waiter who is good\nat Pokémon battles.\c
Wonderful battle! A learning experience.\n...Thanks for the tip!
Our specialty is the best\nPokémon battles.
Welcome!\c\nWould you like a cold drink\nwith your Pokémon battle?\c
That was a wonderful battle.\nBravo!
Invigorating Soda Pop for exhausted\nPokémon after a battle!\r\nAvailable in any vending machine!
Twist Mountain changes in every season,\nand this old man changes in every battle!\c
Go easy on...\na grown-up?!
This old man likes winter.\c\nSnow on Twist Mountain...\nhas an indescribable beauty.
My Pokémon love the ore mined here,\nand they love fiery Pokémon battles!\c
You got me!\nMy Pokémon thinks so, too!
If Pokémon eat the ore inside a mountain,\na hole grows, and our work speeds up!\c\nPeople and Pokémon\nwork great together!
The number two Trainer\non Twist Mountain is me!\c
From now on, you are the number two Trainer\non Twist Mountain.
From now on, I will be the\nnumber three Trainer on Twist Mountain.\c\nFor your information,\nthe number one is Clay!
What do you think about the cannons?\c\nIsn't it great that you can\nexperience how flying Pokémon feel?\c\nNext, experience the feeling\nof losing a Pokémon battle!\c
I was blown away!!
I'll be stronger if I fight\nwhile thinking about Pokémon!\r\nVictory will come my way!
Trainer! I bet you're\ntoo blown away to fight!\c
What a calm person you are!\nYou're amazing!
Cannons used once may be used again.\nIt's recycling! Precisely!
In order to jump higher,\nI am practicing really hard!\c
No problem! Even though I lost,\nI will just prepare and jump again!
Trainer! Do you remember\nwhat you were told at the beginning?\c\n“The cannons go up, down,\nleft, and right.\r\nYou can enter them from anywhere!"\c\nHow about that?\nI am good at imitating him, aren't I?
My plans are perfectly honed!\nI cannot lose!\c
No way! What part of my fighting style\ndid I forget to double-check?
Check after check after check!\nComplacency leads to accidents!
Battles in the Castelia Gym are\nbeautiful! They are pure art!!\c
Falling beautifully...\nThis is also an art...
If you step on two switches, two lamps\nwill light up and a gate will open!\r\nThis is also an art!
I like the feeling of walking\nthrough the honey walls...\r\nI've walked through them many times.\c
How is this possible?\nI will walk through the honey walls again.
The honey walls...\nWhat do you think they are made of?\c\nDon't you think it is odd\nthat Burgh never tells us?
What do you think? This Pokémon Gym...\nHow should I say? Isn't it full of...\r\noutrageous and mysterious charms?\c
As a Trainer,\nyou are full of charm!
I absolutely love this Gym where\nBurgh's vision became reality!
I wasn't hiding under the floor\njust to lose!
I was defeated by your strong spirit.\nYou seem unfazed by anything!
OK, challenger!\nBring it on!\c
But then, but...\nI lost?!
Get on the elevators,\nand go down and down!\c\nA Trainer's spirit means\ntake it as far as you can!
When the elevator goes up,\nmy spirits rise!\c\nWhen the elevator goes down,\nmy spirits fall...\c\nIf you want to know why Clay\nis at the bottom, defeat me!\c
I lost. There go my spirits...\naaaaaall the way down!
Clay is waiting\nat the very bottom because...\c\nhe wants to remember\nthat he was at the bottom in the past.
I face my Pokémon,\nand we share our real feelings.\c\nSometimes that's what I do\nin this Pokémon Gym.\c
Right now, my Pokémon and I\nboth feel the sting of defeat!
When we lose,\nI apologize to my Pokémon...\c\nIt is important for our future,\nand it helps me grow strong!
Wow! You are so strong!\nCongratulations!
Here's my lame excuse:\nI lost because the ship was swaying!






I thought I could take it easy against you,\nbut got burned bad!
While I was staring at your pretty face,\nthe Pokémon battle was over.
You know so many rare Pokémon!\nOr at least, your Pokémon are new to me.
I... I am not disappointed.\nBecause I am elegant!
Dizzy...\nSo very dizzzzzy...
Having traveled the world, I realized\nwe can communicate through our Pokémon.\c
That message came through loud and clear!
Having traveled around the world,\nI learned that travel brings change!\c\nWe should not be afraid of change.
Countless feelings infuse these ruins!\c\nIt's fun to imagine them!\nAnd how are you feeling?\c
I am feeling...\nvery upset because I could not win!
People and Pokémon\neach have different feelings.\c\nAnd probably both are correct.
Being with my Pokémon makes me happy\neven when we’re in a bad situation!\c
Yes! It was fun that your and my Pokémon\nwere both so energetic!
When I feel lonely at night,\nI curl up with my Pokémon\r\nand watch the twinkling stars.\c\nI track the shooting stars\nand slow down the rhythm of my life.
Whether I travel or not,\nI want to make a great discovery.\c
Oh! I may have discovered\nsomething good about you!
The world is full of mysteries!\c\nThat's why I look closely.\nThat's why I listen carefully.\c\nI think, I reflect, and\nI discover something new.
The Abilities of my Pokémon!\nI will show them to you.\c
I could not make really good use\nof the Ability Mummy...
If an Ability is changed to Mummy,\nthe Pokémon cannot use its original\r\nAbility. It's subtly devious, isn't it?
Oh! That moment!\c\nThat's when we use Pokémon.\c
Oh! Is it over already?
Oh! That moment.\c\nThat's when you notice\nhow great Pokémon are!
I am a Psychic, so just one look at you\ntells me that you are a Trainer!\c
I am a Psychic,\nso I can tell the battle is over.
Sifting the ever-changing sands...\nSifting my ever-changing feelings...\c\nTelepathy means others will be aware of\nmy feelings. That could be a good thing.\c\nWait! It means others will be aware when\nI have awkward or painful feelings, too!
Let me battle with you!\c
Wow...\nYou are my strongest challenger so far.
Engage the switches and\nstart from the defined position.\c\nIf you try all the combinations,\nsomeday you'll find the right one!
The problem is never\nwhether you can battle or not.\r\nIt's whether you will battle or not.\c
If you don't fight, you won't lose,\nbut you won't grow stronger, either.
When you're not sure if you'll succeed,\nbuild momentum and take a leap!\c\nIt's fine! Because your Pokémon\nare always with you!
The slippery frozen floor is perfect\nfor improving your sense of balance!\c
I slipped and lost!
Brycen slides on the frozen floor\nall the time, so it's worn down, and\r\nit looks like you can see the path...\r\nbut maybe I'm imagining it.
Well, well, if you are feeling dizzy\nbecause of the Gym machines,\r\nI will stand in your path!\c
Oh, dear me!
Being fired into the air by cannons\nand spinning on the ice many times...\r\nIt's difficult to get Badges.
I always calm myself and choose\nthe critical moment in a battle.\c
Mmmm?! What?!\nNo way? Really?!
Being calm and having no emotion\nare different.\c\nBrycen rejoices quietly,\nand he grows quietly in rage...
I am the King of Karate!!\c\nI've taught my Pokémon moves\nthat they'll use in battle with you!\c
I am the King of Karate!!\nI am skillful, but I lose quite often...
I am from a fighting dojo in Kanto!!\nThis is my global debut, so to speak!
Oh! Trainer!\nDo you want to learn a bitter lesson?\c
The training is over!
Going slowly is fine.\c\nIf I train every single day,\nI will be strong someday!
Are you looking for a Pokémon here,\nor are you just taking a walk?\r\nEither way, have a battle with me!\c
What is it?\nI can't explain it, but you are great!
Even if you forget about this battle,\nI will never forget this!
Competitive eating\nis one thing I'm good at!\c
What I am bad at\nis Pokémon battles...
I am training here to improve my\nweak points.
Beginnings are important, whether\nin a good novel or a good battle!
It seems this is the beginning\nof my final chapter.
I feel we're about to turn the page\nto the epilogue of this story.
Wow. I'm dumbstruck!\c\nI know a lot of words, but right now I can't\nfigure out how to say this.\c\nPerhaps, if the feeling I'm having now\nis put into words, it will be trapped there.\c\nSo let me say this...\nMy feeling is you're a great Trainer!
I never thought you would use that move...\nNot a bad choice at all.
Good, good...\nBut I will never retreat from any battle.
Even in this situation,\nthere must be a way to triumph!
If somebody wins a battle, then, without\ndoubt, someone else has lost the battle.\c\nThat's the way of battle.\c\nA real warrior doesn't dash off in pursuit\nof the next victory, nor throw a fit\r\nwhen experiencing a loss.\c\nA real warrior ponders the next battle.
Oh, so strong.\nThat makes my heart dance!
That's my final Pokémon!\nSo we'll use our last bit of strength!
Well, this may be the last.\nI will put everything into my next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\nor sole best combination...\c\nThat's why it is difficult\nto keep winning.\c\nHowever, I think a heart that desires\nstrength and strives to grow\r\nstronger is a precious ideal.\c\nThat is why I respect you--\nbecause you have these things.
I get the feeling a wonderful time\nis about to start. I'm excited!
Even at a time like this,\nI should stay cool and collected...
For the sake of the Pokémon\nthat believe in me, I will never give up.
As a Trainer, you are both excellent\nand elegant. Your Pokémon have class.\c\nI am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you believe that Pokémon battles\nhelp us understand one another?
I will show you that my love for my friends\npermeates every cell of my body. Behold!
My friends getting hurt...\nThat's what a Pokémon battle is.
Agggghh.\nEvery single time...
It's not fun to see\nmy friends in trouble.
Well, that's OK.\nI was expecting this defeat.
Do you really think you can stop us\nwith that?
My last friend...\nPlease share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you--\nand not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The truth I held...\nThe dreams Pokémon shared...
I was expecting exactly that kind of move!
What is going on here?
My calculations... No! My careful schemes!\nThe world should be mine!
I am a Doctor!\c\nIf you have Pokémon in bad shape...\nLet me see your Pokémon in battle!\c
Your strength is fathomless!\nI am deeply impressed.
Whether your Pokémon are healthy\nor not, I'll restore them to full health!\c
I aim to be the best Doctor in the world!\c\nBut first, I intend to become\nthe best Trainer in the world!
An Ace Trainer like me has pride,\nso I won't lose!\c
I could not protect my pride.\nI'm mortified!
Pride does not mean acting arrogantly!\c\nI'm really proud of what\nI have achieved in my life!
I've thought about what I can do\nto help my Pokémon win, and\r\nfinally I figured out the answer!\c
I'm afraid I could not read\nwhat you wanted to do...
Read what your opponent wants to do.\c\nYour opponent is human and may change\nplans from moment to moment. Be careful!
Before going to the Pokémon League,\nlet me test my skills!\c
It's obvious, but there is always\nsomeone better...
The Elite Four are said to be\nwaiting at the Pokémon League.\r\nI wonder what kind of people they are.
Oh, boy...\nMy Pokémon want to brag about me.\c\nSo, let's start!\c
Ouch!\nThey can't brag about me.
Because I respect my opponents,\nI want to win against them!\c\nThat's why I want other people to think\nthey want to win against me!
Whenever I am lost, I meet a Trainer!\nOf course, we're gonna fight!\c
Mmmmm... It's not good\nto fight when I am lost.
When people move ahead,\nthey get lost, or they stop...\c\nAt those moments, Pokémon give you\ncourage to keep moving forward!
The people who pass by here\nhave such different moods!\c\nIt's fun to watch, and even more fun\nto fight against them!\c
Mwa haha!\nIt's fun!
Winning is good,\nbut winning is not everything...\r\nDon't lose sight of what's important!
Wait! \nYou, young Trainer over there!\c\nLook at my Pokémon.\c
Not bad!\nI like your strength.
As a Pokémon grows, its connection\nto its Trainer will improve,\r\nand their bond becomes stronger!
If there is a steep cave in the east,\nI go there and train my Pokémon, and\r\nif there is a strong Trainer in the west,\r\nI go there and challenge that Trainer!\c
My Pokémon clearly lack\nproper training!!
Pokémon training Pokémon...\c\nIf they live in rugged wilderness,\nthat can happen naturally.
Oh, are you the legendary Pokémon\nthat is said to live here?\c
You startled me.\nYou are a person!
In the story I know,\nthe legendary Pokémon\r\nwas training its student Pokémon.
These Pokémon were born\non the same day and raised together!\c
Oh!\nYou're pretty good!
Our days with Pokémon\nare full of happiness, and\r\nour joys will grow as we live together!
Please tell me what kinds of Pokémon are\nby your side and share your happiness\r\nwhen you are happy!\c
Wow!\nWonderful!
When I've been happy or sad,\nthe Pokémon have always been with me.\c\nI hope I can stay with them\nas long as possible.
Celestial Tower means a perfect tower!\c\nOh, never mind.\nLet's have a Pokémon battle.\c
You're really perfect!
I am far from perfect...
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and\nPokémon that grew up elsewhere--\r\nboth rest here quietly.\c
Your Pokémon are full of life!
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and\nPokémon that grew up elsewhere--\r\nall are precious Pokémon...
I will guess what you are...\c\nYou are...\na Pokémon Trainer!\c
What was that?\nI guessed what you were, though.
Everyone can make the effort\nto understand their opponent.
The Dragon Gym in Opelucid City\nis where tough Trainers show\r\nthey can carve out their own path!\c
I'm sure you can carve out\nyour own path!
As the name suggests,\na Gym Leader is the top of a Gym!\c\nThe Leader is top of the heap\nat this Opelucid Gym!\c\nIf you want to meet the Leader,\nclimb up on the dragons' backs\r\nand aim for the top floor!
Do you understand\nhow the dragons' heads move?\c
You're strong! I guess you want to know\nabout the dragons' heads pretty badly.
The dragons' arms go up and down...\c\nAnd depending on the arms,\nthe dragons' heads turn right and left\r\nand move up and down, too.\c\nListen! Here is a hint!\c\nIf both arms point down,\nthe dragon's head sinks down, too.
I will test you to see how well\nyou really know Pokémon!\c
You are bringing out your Pokémon's\nfull potential!
I am a Trainer. \nI don't have to get strong myself.\c\nAll I have to do is to support Pokémon\nso that they can fight at their best.
By any chance,\nare you unsure of what to do?\c
What is this?\nI felt your confidence.
The dragons in this Gym\ncan be elevators, too!
I will tell a Trainer who beats me\nhow to move forward in this Gym!\c
Wow! \nYou beat me!
Jump from a triangle mark!\c\nWhen you land on a switch on an arm,\nthe dragon's head will move,\r\nand you can move ahead!
Are you happy just hanging out\nwith Pokémon?\r\nOr do they have to be strong?\r\nWe'll see which type you are!\c
Your Pokémon seem to be happy\njust hanging around with you!
Every person loves Pokémon\nin a different way.\c\nGetting strong with my Pokémon...\nThat's the way I chose.
I wonder what you will do\nas a Trainer?!\c
Oh, you fight very well.\nYou are great!
I love Pokémon battles!\c\nI never know what my opponent will do.\nIt gives me chills!\c\nWin or lose, it's the excitement\nof the fight that counts!
My favorite word is “challenge"!\nDo you like challenges?\c
You seem to like challenges!
Do you like challenges...?\c\nIf you take a challenge,\nyou can find something good.\c\nIf you don't try anything, you just\nmake excuses.
Argh...\nMy heart aches!
We have ten years' experience battling!\nI give you a taste of a Veteran's skill!\c
I guess the time spent\nis not everything!
Getting stronger...\c\nis like walking down a road\nthat never ends,\r\nno matter how much you fight...\c\nIt's what this Dragon Gym is about.\nIt's the secret of the dragons' backs...
I've heard about you.\nI heard you work Pokémon hard!\c
Yes, I heard you are strong.\nYou match what I heard exactly.
To get to a lower level, stand still\nin the midst of quicksand.\c\nI'm not being kind...\nMy companions will defeat you.
You!\nTo please my Pokémon, lose!\c
What a Trainer!
Because of you,\nmy Pokémon lost!\r\nDon't you feel sorry for them?\c\nBesides, you are just depending\non your Pokémon for strength.
If everyone frees their Pokémon,\nthere is no winning or losing!\c
If I don't have Pokémon,\nI won't lose like this!
How dare you interrupt us\nwithout understanding us?
We fight for the young king...\nThat's it!\c
My king...\nI am so sorry.
Everything changes.\nUnova will also be born again.\r\nWhy don't you admit that?
You can't change the world\nwithout a little pain!\c
Ouch...\nI don't like pain.
We're trying so hard to change the world\nbecause nobody else is trying. Yet...\c\nThat's right! You! Can you understand\nour lord N's feelings?
Pokémon are too good for the likes of\nyou! They are amazing, but putting them\r\nin the hands of foolish Trainers can bring\r\nnothing good!\c
Argh!\nAnnoying!
Me, lose? Here I am, covered in sand,\nthrowing everything I have into it,\r\nand I lose? Am I that much of a loser?\c\nIt should be your loss.\nAnd that's an order!
I won't tolerate people\nwho have different ideas!\c
Argh...\nI won't forgive you!
I repeat! We won't tolerate people\nwho have different ideas!\c\nYour friends are waiting below--\nnow get out!
When I am surrounded by rocks,\nmy spirit goes up!!\c
When I lose,\nmy spirits sink...
My spirits rise and fall.\nI'm just charmingly unpredictable!
Why do I dig?\nWhy do you fight?\r\nLet's find out.\c
Your past experience...\nIs that the source of your strength?
The more you fight,  \nthe stronger you'll be.\c\nThe more you dig, \nthe bigger the hole will be...\c\nIf you have a purpose, \nthere's no wasted effort!
At work, we do our best.\nThat is my, and my Pokémon's, way of life!\c
We did our best,\nand this is the result?!
Well, well, I guess I'll go back to work.\c\n'Cause my precious Pokémon\nare better at work.
My favorite things are:\nMountains! Meals! Pokémon!\r\nAnd fun battles!!\c
Oh, ho ho!\nYou got me!
Your team is so strong!\c\nBut my Pokémon were also\nquite good, weren't they?
I'm chasing my dream,\nand I'm fighting for a victory!\c
I can't catch that dream!
I am looking for a legendary Pokémon\nsaid to be hiding in this cave.\c\nYes, it's true. Men are suckers for\nadventure, no matter how old we get!
This cave is full of rocks\ngenerating electricity!\r\nThe electricity is charging me up!\c
Yowch, a lightning spark!
The sources of my energy are\nmy precious Pokémon!\r\nThis has been scientifically proven!!
I will research and investigate\nyour Pokémon!\c
I must analyze my defeat...
Why don't you go discover\nsomething else?
I will unlock the mechanism\nand find the secret of your power!\c
I was so preoccupied with the mechanism,\nI forgot to concentrate on the battle!
The mechanism of rain, and\nthe science of changing seasons...\r\nNature is full of wonders.
I see.\nI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\nIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.\nI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\nIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.\nI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\nIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
Plasmaaaa!\nWahhhhh!
Long live Team Plasma!
For every great plan, there\nis someone to get in the way.
Have you learned your lesson now?\n...I'm such a sore loser.
Plasmaaaa!\nAhh, our beautiful dream...
Plasmaaaa!\nThis is a nightmare!
Whoa, whoa, come on now!\nI'm shocked to lose against a little kid!
It's best to use what you have learned\nin order to master it!\c
What can you learn by losing?\nI feel like there's a “Eureka!" here for me.
I'm mastering the lesson in three\ndimensions by experiencing it like this!
Come on! \nYou're just a kid--a kid on an ego trip!
Our rules and your rules\nare different!
Plasmaaaa! If this keeps up,\nwe won't save the Pokémon!
My hunch is you're sabotaging us because\nyou're flat-out jealous of our cool outfits.
You seem to understand the importance\nof the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,\nI can still pull this off and win.
Impressive.\nBut why can't I win?!

Impressive.\nBut why can't I win?!
Well, at a time like this,\nlet's have a Pokémon battle!\c
I see. \nWas that your favorite Pokémon?
Wherever I go in the world,\nI have Pokémon battles!\c\nOnce I ask about someone's favorite\nPokémon, we soon become friends!
My way of life is dynamic!\c
My way of losing is\nalso dynamic!
My Pokémon are always with me!\nThat's why I can be dynamic!

...What?
Pah, is that it?\nI lost before I knew it...
Oh, hee hee hee...\nYou're so strong.
Pant, pant, pant, pant...



The ideal movement of living things,\nsuch pure beauty!\c\nAh, let me behold them!\c
I saw their beauty up close!
You know, creatures that exert \nall their strength are always beautiful.
If you win against me,\nI will give you something good\r\nfrom this backpack!\c
You are great!\nAnd strong!
Here you are.\nI will give you this as I promised!\c
It feels great to run as fast as you can\nover mountains and through forests.\r\nRight?
I came here on my journey,\nbut it's kind of lively here, isn't it?\c
Is there a festival or something \ngoing on here?
This is what I found during my trip.\nI don't need it, so I will give it to you.\c
Everybody is dressed the same way.\nIs this some kind of ceremony?
I bet athletes are not satisfied\nwith their games.\c\nThat's how I feel\nwhen I watch them.\c\nThe reason? If you win against me,\nI will tell you why!\c
Are you pleased with your victory?\nOr are you unsatisfied?
This Moomoo Milk is tasty\nand so very satisfying!\c
No matter how great their play is,\nthere is always a greater play.\c\nI am never satisfied with my bread,\neven though I bake it very well.\c\nI always want to make the next\nloaf even more delicious!
A place where you can warm up!\nThat's what I heard and why I came here!\r\nLet's turn up the heat on this thing!\c
The heat here is too much.\nI'm just burning up!
My warrior's heart is burning!\nThank you for the hot battle!\c\nNext, I will stay on this hot streak\nand watch the game!
To raise healthy Pokémon, you need\nto keep their minds and bodies active,\r\nwatching games and having battles!\c
It's so frustrating to lose!\nBut it's also important to learn from it.
You learn more when you lose\nthan when you win!\r\nI think it's the same for sports, too.
The Pokémon I raised are\nas good as professionals!\c
The Pokémon you raised\nare great, too!
There are so many ways\nto raise Pokémon.
I am not skipping work!\c
If I had known this would happen,\nI would have worked diligently.
Taking a productive break\nis also part of any job!
Someone sent me a ticket, so I came.\nBut there's no game going on!\c
I have a lot of work to do.\nWhat am I doing here?
Athletes on off days are no better\nthan guys on days off.
I wonder if there are great children\nwho will become stars someday\r\nwho are now just kids at my preschool.\c
You are also quite brilliant, but\nreal stars are cool.
You seem to have potential as a star.\nSo, will you please be my friend?\c
Should I get autographs now\nfrom children who are likely to be stars?
I love sports and Pokémon most of all.\c\nHow about a battle?\nThey used to call me the Cleaner!\c
I could not stop all\nof your Pokémon's attacks...
I used to be a Striker.\nI was responsible for scoring goals.\c\nNow I am a sweeper.\nI am responsible for sweeping floors.
The athletes' Pokémon are great!\c\nBut my Pokémon are also great!\c
Your Pokémon are also great!
I will strive to raise my Pokémon\nto that level!
Did you see today's game?!\c\nThere was some great ball handling\nby players and Pokémon!\c\nThe excitement is pumping me up\nfor a battle!\c
I lost, but I am still excited!
The only place you can watch Pokémon\nenjoying sports is Nimbasa City!
When I come here, I get hyper!\nSo, let's have a battle right away!\c
I lost against you too quickly!
When I am watching a game, I get hyper!\nI just can't sit still!
Doctor! Is there a Doctor\nin the audience?\c\nYes, I am a Doctor.\nLet's get into a battle.\c
Oh! My Pokémon is all worn out!
When Pokémon lose energy, Max Revive!\nYou should also take one with you.\c
When I am watching a game,\nI just keep worrying about\r\nwhether an athlete will be injured.
You chose to speak to me from\namong so many people!\r\nYou have a good eye!\c
You are a worthy opponent!
The way you use moves...\nQuite honestly, I like it!\c\nHere, this is for you!\c
Heehee.\c\nEven when I am in the crowd,\npeople can tell I am strong.
I usually act like an Ace Trainer,\nbut I want to be an ordinary girl,\r\nat least when I am here.\c
I don't want to think about Pokémon\nvery much right now!
If I give you this,\nwill you leave me alone?\c
Even as an Ace Trainer, sometimes\nI just want to be an ordinary girl!\c\nI want to scream for the cool athletes,\nand enjoy my time.
Which team will score next?!\nIf you can win, I will tell you!\c
Aha!\nThat team will score next!
My psychic power only works\nright before a player scores a point.
Heheh...\c\nThe team I want to win\nalways wins!\c
What...? Was everything up till now\njust a coincidence...?
Feelings matter when you cheer!\nIf I believe, I feel my team will win!
Fishing is a perfectly respectable sport!\nWhy isn't there a fishing stadium?!\c
...Of course, fishing is fun\nwhen you enjoy it in nature.\c
I like quiet nature,\nbut I like lively places like this, too.
A lot of sports started\nas Gentlemen's games!\c
Ladies and Gentlemen!\nThe game is over!
Because I am a Gentleman,\nI will present you with this gift.\c
Pokémon battles were born spontaneously\nwhen people and Pokémon\r\nfirst became friendly.
Hey, hey, did you see that? Awesome!\nA lot of famous people from TV are here!\c
Athletes are all coooool.\nI want to be like them.
Aghhhhh. Why didn't I bring a camera,\nor a notebook for an autograph?
Sports and juggling are the same.\nYou must entertain the audience!\r\nI will show you the fruits of my practice.\c
While I am having a Pokémon battle,\nI catch ten balls!
I have mastered the technique,\nbut I cannot use it!\r\nI just have to have real battles!
That incredibly flashy dorm,\nand squealing cheerleaders all around...\c\nGrrr...\nI am envious!\c
What is so great about popular athletes?\nWhat is bad about martial artists?
A run-down dojo, and a lot of shouts like\nhai-ya and kee-up...\c\nIf I had known this before, I would have\nbeen a different kind of athlete.
When I grow up,\nI will be a pro athlete!\c
Waaaaah!\nI will never give you my autograph!
I will practice my autograph\nfor when I go pro!
My daddy is\nan athlete here!\c
Waaaaaah. Dadddddddy.
...I won't cry.\n'Cause I promised my daddy.
Even Socialites enjoy sports,\nin a very elegant way!\c\nA Pokémon battle is\na sport in a way!\r\nLet's fight elegantly!\c
O-ho-ho!\nI lost so elegantly.
Oh dear, I mistook this for a ball\nand ordered it. Now it's yours.\c
First of all, we should enjoy\nsports and Pokémon battles!\c\nIf you get hung up on winning and losing,\nyou lose sight of what is most valuable.
I will be strong in Pokémon battles,\nand I will marry a professional athlete!\c
Ah.\nI still have a long way to go!
Your Pokémon are strong. I will give\nsomething good to a strong person!\c
Strong people are always totally\nattractive. Don't you think?
A Hiker, an athlete,\nand a Pokémon Trainer.\r\nDo you know what is important?\c
Grrrrrrr!\nClearly you know it!
Prepare thoroughly. \nIf you don't, you can't do anything!
I can't believe nobody has noticed me...\nI am a star!\c
Don't look at me. I lost!
Whose autograph do you want?\nDon't you want one of mine?
You are energetic!\nI will punish lazy children!\c
You just don't quit!\nYou are so energetic!
OK! An energetic Trainer!\nTake this!\c
Nurses need plenty of stamina,\nboth day and night!
My darling is working here.\nHow about that? Are you envious?\c
My darling is seriously the best.\nHe puts athletes to shame.
My darling is a Janitor!\nHe cleans this entire big place\r\nby himself every day. Cool, huh?\r\nNobody else can do what he does.
Games in the rain look extra tough,\ndon't they?\c\nI wonder what Pokémon battles\nin rain are like.\c
Well, this place is indoors,\nso they don't get rained out.
If a stadium has a roof, \nthey can play a game anytime!
Hey! It's me! It's me!\nI am the best Pilot in Unova!\c
You! You are daring!\nBe my apprentice!
A once-in-a-lifetime flight!\nFly, fly, and fly away!
Do you want to know\nhow the VIP seats are?\c\nI will tell you\nif you win against me!\c
VIP seats are very far away\nfrom the athletes!
I could see the game fine, but\nthe athletes looked like grains of rice.
You!\nYou are a fan of that person.\c\nI can tell!\nBut that person is mine!\c
Oh no, oh why?\nI am sorry...
Come to think of it,\nthe more supporters there are,\r\nthe better.\c\nYou! Cheer until you lose your voice,\nand clap until your hands fall off!
When I am watching a game,\nI feel like I should be moving, too!\c
That was a good workout!
The dorm is fine, but I want to play\nsports outdoors.
I want to drag people here\nand have them enlist as Pokémon Rangers.\c
Wow! Electrifying!\nYou are so goooood!
You! Be a Pokémon Ranger!\nI will give you a good workout!
Watch a game during a study break!\nHave a battle during a game break!\c
Gah!\nThis is so not relaxing!
When I come here for fun,\nI can study more efficiently!
OK, I decided!\nIf I win against you,\r\nI will be a Gym Leader!\c
Ummmm...\nMaybe I'm not ready to be a Gym Leader?
I have to consider what I will be\nby trying a lot of things!
I wonder if being good at sports\nand being good at battles are related?\c
It was very helpful...
Ummmm. You are\nquite interesting.\c\nPlease have this!\c
Both sports and Pokémon are\nlike a science for me!
I am stuck inside the lab,\nwith a medicinal smell every day,\r\nand then I get stressed out.\c
Waaaaaahhh! Frustrating!
Breaking out made me feel better!\nHere's a token of my appreciation.\c
Let's have another Pokémon battle\nsometime, so we won't be stressed out!
These are not shorts!\nThese are half pants!\c
You were so strong that\nmy half pants almost fell down!
You are awesome!\nHere's an awesome gift for you!\c
I envy basketball players.\n'Cause they wear shorts, not half pants.\c\nBut baseball and football\nuniforms are also cool!
Mmm!\nYou smell like an athlete!\c
I see. That is the smell\nthat strong people give off...
You seem to be getting even stronger...\nOK. Please take this.\c
I hope you will get even stronger\nby using it.
Wow, you have a lot of Badges.\nLet me see your skills!\c
That fighting style reminds me\nof the old days!
A person like you should use\ntop-shelf items--like this!\c
No matter how old we get,\nlet's stay Trainers!
Cheering makes us\nthirsty. Right?\c\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll give you a drink!\c
The battle made me\neven thirstier!
Here you are.\nI will give you something good!\c
At a place like this,\nit's good to drink a lot of water!
Cheering makes us\nthirsty. Right?\c\nIf you can win against me,\nI'll give you a drink!\c
The battle made me\neven thirstier!
Here you are.\nI will give you something good!\c
At a place like this,\nit's good to drink a lot of water!
Let's have a battle on these grounds,\nwhich I keep looking sharp!\c
The best battle\non the best ground!
OK! I will keep the grounds\nlooking perfect!
This air of excitement brings back\nmemories. In those days, I was also...\c
It makes my old wound ache...
I may not look like it,\nbut I used to be quite an athlete.
Are you a criminal?!\c
Oh, you are not a criminal...\nSorry! Lo siento!
I'm here because I heard someone\naround here was faking points.
What? A battle at a place like this?\nWait! Everybody is watching us!\c
Well, thanks to you, \nI overcame my stage fright.
What? Nobody is watching me?\nNooooo. Look at me, please!
I want you to tell me something!\c
You showed me your full strength!
I will work at the Battle Subway\nfrom now on, but...\r\nwhere is it?
I want to play tennis\nlike a strong athlete!\c
Joe: A no-point game\nagainst you 'cause you're strong...\c\nRoss: A no-point game\n'cause we could not win at all!
I want to be as good a Cyclist\nas a strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\nThen, we cannot have a battle.
I want to play ball\nlike a strong athlete!\c

I want to learn more from\na strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\nI prefer a doubles match.
Whoosh! Whoosh!\nI can fight like that!\c
Joe: Fffffft...\nFffffft, fffffft... The ball needs air.\c\nRoss: Faaaault!\nI missed a serve!
They can keep moving\nfor such a long time.\c\nSmashers are really great!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
Hah!\c\nDid you see my power serve?\c\nAnd my Pokémon is\neven stronger!\c

The person who controls his serves\ncontrols the game.\r\nI will practice my serves a bit more.
Hah!
I love to watch professionals play!\nYaaaay! I won't lose, either!\c
Ai: What?\nDid we lose...?\c\nCiel: Ouch... I knew watching a game and\nplaying it are different!
Watching a professional game\nmakes me strangely confident!
Exciting!
I want to move elegantly, too!\nHey! Have a battle with me!\c

When professionals are playing,\nit looks so easy...
Thrilling!
Oh!\c\nAthletes are looking over this way!\nLet's have a battle to impress them.\c
Masa: Agghhh!\nWe showed them an embarrassing scene.\c\nYas: Hurrah! Hurrah!\nMy Pokémon! What...?
I thought they were looking at us, but\nthey were looking at their opponents...
Is that athlete looking at me?\nNo, he's not.
If I win in a Pokémon battle,\ncheer for this team.\c

I lost, so I will cheer for you!\c\nHurray! Hurray! Go you go!\nHustle! Hustle! Go you go!
Ummmm. The cheering for this team\nis not nearly loud enough...
Look at this buff body!\nAnd the Pokémon that support it!\c\nLet's have a Pokémon battle\nto show off my greatness!\c
Masa: The greatness of basketball...\nI think you got it.\c\nYas: Shall we curl up \nlike balls?
The important thing in basketball\nis outstanding teamwork!
Hmph! Hmph!\c\nFirst-class athletes \nspeak with their backs.
The way the athletes scramble\nfor that ball...\c\nI wish they'd fight over me that way!\c

From the ball's point of view,\nit's like, please don't fight over me!
The way the athletes scramble\nfor that ball...\c\nI wish they'd fight over me that way!
If you win, I will tell you\nwhy I like basketball!\c
Kat: Come on!\c\nPhae: Look! Even though we lost, \nthe ball is still spinning!
When you are watching basketball,\nit reminds you of fruit in a basket,\r\nand it looks delicious. Right?
Basketball... No, no. For a battle, \nyou need to have two Pokémon.
My special skill is that I can\nspin a ball on my finger.\r\nI can spin it forever!\c

I want to have Poké Balls\nwith the same designs as\r\nthe balls used in sports!
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,\nyou need to have two Pokémon.
Look!\nMy defense is magnificent!\c
Hawk: It's strange. When professionals\nare playing, it looks so easy...\c\nDar: I guess we cannot play\nquite as well as the professionals...
Rock-solid defense!\nThat's a real thrill in football!
DE-fense! DE-fense!
Look!\nMy magnificent offense!\c

Offense that smashes in every direction!\nThat's a real thrill in football!
Offffffense!
The bond of football fans\nis stronger than any tackle!\c
Hawk: The bond between you and\nyour Pokémon is strong, too!\c\nDar: This feeling will go well past\nthe goal line...
Football is knockdown amazing,\nbecause you can feel the excitement,\r\nthe bond between players and the crowd!
Our bond as fans\nis way stronger than this!
My cheer will go over the goal line\nand will be heard for a million miles!\c

When I cheer for my team\nuntil I get thirsty,\r\nFresh Water tastes even better!
Come on! Cheer louder!\nYell! Yell!
I mainly play on offense.\nMy friend is mainly defense.\c\nI will show you the teamwork\nof football fans!\c
Cam: The teamwork of your Pokémon\nis outstanding!\c\nAbby: I'm super impressed!
If what you want to do is different\nfrom what your partner wants to do,\r\nit's hard to win a Double Battle!
You know, football is a team sport!\nPlease prepare at least two Pokémon!
Double Battles!\c\nThis is the best way to feel\nthe heat of the game of football!\c

The right play can turn a game around...\nPokémon battles are the same, too!
Double Battles!\c\nYou need at least two Pokémon\nto feel the heat of the game of football!
Boom-boom-badum! Ha! Boom-boom-badum!\nListen to the fans' drumbeat!\c
Les: Thank you for listening to the beat\nof our spirit!\c\nWeb: Thank you for listening to the yell\nof our spirit!
Ha, pan-pan-papan, hey-hoo!!\nNext, we will use this rhythm!
Bam-bam-bam! Ha! Bam-bam-bam!\nI see the end coming?
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo Ta-raaa!\nListen to the fans shout!\c

Pan, pan-papan, hey-oo!! Right?\nOh, the rhythm is wonderful!
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo ta-raaa!\nListen to the fans shout!
Olé, olé, oléeee!\nThis is the fan song I wrote!\c\nThe Pokémon listening to this song\ntry harder than usual!\c
Kay: Olé, olé...\nHuh? It's over.\c\nAli: You are very strong!
“Olé!" means\n“Go!" or “Move forward!"
Olé, olé, oléeee!\nI am cheering now!\c\nIf you have two Pokémon,\nI don't mind battling with you!
My friend came here with me...\nShe comes 'cause she wants to sing\r\nmore than cheering for the team.\c

I am a fan of all the players\nwho are doing their best!\r\nSo, I want both teams to win!
With only one Pokémon,\nit's a bit hard to battle.
Hey, you!\nDo you know what offside means?\c
Kay: What we just saw is offside!\nI bet it's offside!\c\nAli: B... Baaaaah!\nI won't tell you anymore!
What? What is offside?\nEr... The girl next to me knows!
Off!
Hey, shall I tell you\nabout the offside penalty?\c

Offside is when...\nEr... The girl next to me will explain!
Side!
The bases loaded with two outs\nin the bottom of the ninth inning...\r\nAfter that... Isn't that obvious?\c
Alf: Strike!\nGame over! Yes, the end!\c\nFred: Ah, my Poké Ball!
A game-winning homer...\nWe always hope for that clutch play!
Striiiiike!!
I don't have a home-run ball,\nbut I do have a Poké Ball!\c

I wish I could catch a home-run ball\njust once!
Ball!
Hit a home run!\c
Ami: We're slammed.\c\nEira: I'm going home.
Elesa's fashion sense\nis funky, too.
A one-on-two battle is\ntoo funky!
Hey, what does “long ball" mean?\c

What I heard is\nit means a home run.\c\n“Homer" also\nmeans a home run!
We two battle together, so\nyou need two Pokémon!
Hey, you!\c\nDon't smile at my favorite player.\c
Ami: Argh! We lost,\nand it's your fault.\c\nEira: You should try harder.\nDon't drag me down.
The only thing we have in common\nis that we like the same team.\c\nBut really, isn't that the most\nimportant thing for a fan?
Argh, because of you, \nwe're in a big pinch.
Argh, annoying!\c\nIt's none of your business\nwho I cheer for.\c

Our teamwork is sooooo bad,\nexcept when we cheer during games.\c\nBut we really don't care\nabout any time but game time.
No way! Argh, we are losing\nbecause you are not really trying!
I am quite strong.\nI will work out today, too!\c
I... I got worked over.
Your strength!\nYou pack quite a punch!
POWER!!\c\nIf you have power that nobody can beat,\nyou can win both Pokémon battles\r\nand football games!\c
I...still don't have enough power?
Mmmm... Maybe I should\ntrain more...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nJoin the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I am still such a rookie!\nBut I have more guts than anybody else!
My Pokémon and I still haven't\npracticed enough...\c\nTo put it in levels, we're maybe a ten...
I am stronger than ever.\nI will work out today, too!!\c
I got worked over.
A swing and a miss...\nI can't keep up with your strength!
POWER!!!\c\nWith my ripped muscles,\nI will overcome everything!\c
I still don't have\nenough muscles...?!
Maybe I should change\nmy training regimen...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nPlease join the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I'm still such a rookie!\nI have more than enough guts, though!
My Pokémon and I\nstill haven't practiced enough...\r\nTo put it in levels, we're about a 20...
I am the strongest.\nI will work out today, too!!\c
I...got worked over!
Your strength is\nhome-run class!
POWER!!!!\c\nI will win! My superior power\ncan blaze any trail!\c
Is it possible that just having power\nis not enough...?
Football games and Pokémon battles\nboth require power and technique.
Pokémon and Poké Balls\nare my real friends!\c\nPlease join the training of\nour Pokémon Eleven!\c
Aghhhhh! I am such a rookie!\nI've got more guts, though!
My Pokémon and I still\nhaven't practiced enough...\r\nTo put it in levels, we're maybe a 50...
I've practiced and practiced\nand become a great player!\r\nNow, let's play ball!\c
Game over!
Now, practice, practice, practice!\c\nPracticing over and over is the best way\nto be good at anything!\c\nMy hard work will make me a great player!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\nspecial training for my Pokémon!\c
My block was supposed to guard\nagainst even Steel-type Pokémon...
Physical therapy is over,\nso we're doing some special training.
Let me tell you about the strength\nof the team you create when\r\nyou put a strong Pokémon at the core.\c
...You taught me!\nYou are great!
It looks like a team built around\na strong Pokémon. That is, an ace\r\nhas advantages and disadvantages.
Together, my Pokémon and I\nare the world's strongest!!\c
Wow! I didn't think anyone could\ncatch my blazing fastball!
My fastballs are so fast,\nnobody can hit them.\c\nVery few can catch my fastballs\nexcept Pokémon.
I, I...\nI'm not fat, am I?\c
Ripped!
I am ripped!\nI am not fat.
I have great footwork with the ball.\nPoké Balls, too. See?\c
After I let Pokémon out of\nPoké Balls... Well, I am still practicing...
I should practice more\non Pokémon handling, too.
I play occasionally,\nbut I want to become a better player!\c\nSo I will fight\na lot of Pokémon battles, too!\c
UGHH!\nI couldn't even pass the ball!
I will do anything to play better!\nIt's over if you get complacent!
An elegant Smasher\nhas an elegant battle!\c
E-e-e-even though I lost,\nI will not panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't be,\nwell, you know,\r\nch-ch-chagrined at losing.\r\nWell, maybe a teensy little bit.
I am in the starting lineup now,\nbut I will be even better soon!\c\nI will practice with a lot\nof Pokémon battles!\c
UGHH!\nMy field positioning was terrible!
If I think about why I made a mistake\nand correct it, I'll make fewer mistakes.\c\nAnd if I work to improve my strength,\nI'll get even stronger!
As a proper lady, I am elegant\nall the way down to my toes!\c
Wahhhhh! What is this??
Oh! I am a lady,\nyet I have lost my nerve...
I've always played games,\nbut now I want to be the best player!\c\nI will practice with a lot of\nPokémon battles!\c
UGHH! I missed the goal!\nI was blocked!!
I won't give up games!\nI won't accept limits!\c\nNobody can stop me\nas long as I want to improve!
I am a lady. I will challenge others\nto battle elegantly!\c
You should...\nGo easy on me!
B-b-b-because I am a lady...\nwaaaah...\r\nI will admit my defeat gracefully...
No matter how much I sweat,\nI won't smell sweaty!\c
A healthy sweat...\nBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
After a battle, take a bath!\nAfter eating, brush your teeth!
The world championships are coming soon!\nI will practice volleys\r\nby using you as a wall!\c
Whoa! Lemme...catch...my breath...\nThat was some good training...
You and I have just met.\nLet's start the game from the beginning!
Hey! Trainer!\c\nI will strike you from above.\nMy attack has a height!\c
That's right.\nThe Pokémon do the fighting, not me...
We always play basketball\nwith Pokémon here!
I will show you a powerful serve!\nWatch this burn in at 120 miles per hour!\c
Your attack just now...\nMore powerful!
Pokémon are sending over\nsome powerful serves so I can practice.
My Pokémon was so cute!
My Pokémon listened to what I said\nand fought for me!
You... You came here because\nsomebody manipulated you.\c\nIf you can win against me,\nI will tell you the secret!\c
Argh! I can't believe\nI lost...
Ghetsis of the Seven Sages supports\nour king, and Ghetsis has\r\nthree subordinates...\r\nThey are the Shadow Triad!
If I win against you,\nrelease your Pokémon!\c
Plasmaaaa!\nI'm mortified.
I don't understand... Your Pokémon seem\nto be happy next to you.
Pokémon living in this Chargestone Cave\nare so beautiful.\r\nBecause they are free from people.\c
Oh, my! No, no.\nPlasmaaaa!
It's bad for ordinary Trainers like you\nto use Pokémon.\c\nIt's good for us members of Team Plasma\nto use Pokémon!
As a proud member of Team Plasma,\nI will gladly battle with you.\c
As a proud member of...\nTeam Plasma...
What do you fight for?\nNo, what do you live for?
OK, Trainer, you use Pokémon!\nShow me your strength!\c
...I see.\nYou're very good at using Pokémon.
Because they use Pokémon, people hold\ncompetitions to sort out the strong from\r\nthe weak...\c\nIs this fair? Is this right?\nAre Pokémon just the Trainers' tools?
The hope of Team Plasma!\nWell, it has nothing to do with you.\c
Hey! What was that?\nYou're too strong! Ugh!
The hope of Team Plasma!\c\nWe know our king will lead us.\nHe will free the Pokémon!\c\nYou! Release your Pokémon\nand stop being a Trainer!
Since coming to Dragonspiral Tower,\nmy stress level has maxed out! The more\r\nhyper I am, the faster you'll go down!\c
Bahhh.\nI have lost my motivation.
Still, this is a great tower.\c\nI feel not only its history\nbut also its awe-inspiring power.
Brycen, Cheren...\nThey are moving around being annoying.\c
I don't understand...\nI don't understand you guys...
Why are you and the Gym Leaders\nagainst us?\r\nI just can't understand it at all.
I'm sure you also thought\n“I am strong" and “I can win"\r\nand came here.\c
Huh...\nYou thought right!
If the king of Team Plasma rules the\nworld, Trainers will disappear, and\r\ndisputes will end!
We exist to serve our lord N!\c
Ah!\nOur lord N!
Because there are nights,\nthe sun is beautiful.\c\nBecause we exist,\nour king shines...
The dawn of Unova\nhas faded in the distance...
Don't stop us!\nI told you that we wouldn't stop.
What? It looks like you can still fight!
Even though I lost, I will still say:\nPlasmaaaa, go Plasmaaaa!
My Pokémon can take that!\nI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\nThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!\nI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\nThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!\nI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\nThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
Oh!\nSo, you chose that move!
Every time I watch my Pokémon battle,\nit ends like this...
The Pokémon on both sides\ntried sooo hard, didn't they?
Oh!\nSo, you chose that move!

Moves that never miss\nand moves that can attack first...\r\nThere sure are a lot of different moves.\c
It's important to choose\nwhich item your Pokémon holds...
I see!\c\nLosing to you means\nthat I still have a lot to learn.
Moves that never miss\nand moves that can attack first...\r\nThere sure are a lot of different moves.\c

B-both my Pokémon and I are\ngoing to give it our all!
OK!\nThis little one is up next!
Uh-oh...\nAm I in trouble?!
Aww...\nI couldn't win...
B-both my Pokémon and I are\ngoing to give it our all!
OK!\nThis little one is up next!

Uh-oh...\nAm I in trouble?!
Aww...\nI couldn't win...
Hi, hi! Trainer!\c\nI will let you see\nwhat kind of Pokémon I have!\c
Did you see my Pokémon?\nIt's sturdy and great, isn't it?
Pokémon with the Sturdy Ability\ncannot be knocked out with one hit!
Hi, hi! Trainer!\c\nPlease show me what kinds of Pokémon\nyou are training!\c
Great, great! I didn't know\nthat way to raise Pokémon!
When you let a Pokémon evolve, it will be\nstronger, but if you don't let it evolve,\r\nit will learn moves quicker.
I can't see up ahead\nbecause of the sandstorm!\c\nBecause I can't see,\nI'll have a battle with you!\c
S-a-n-d-s-t-o-r-m.
This parasol keeps off the sun and rain,\nbut it can't stand up to sandstorms...\c\nAh! My tears are falling on Route 4...
A battle on a raised walkway!\nThat's kind of cool.\c
Losing is uncool.\nNo, no, you are cool.
It's good to sway wildly\non a raised walkway!
I love raised walkways!\c\nBalancing is fun,\nso I often come here to play.\c
I lost, \nbut I won't stop!
If you walk on a raised walkway, you can\nmove without encountering wild Pokémon.\c\nBut if you stop to rest for a while,\nyou'll fall!
Originally, Pokémon lived\nin the natural world!\c\nSo, it's good to train Pokémon\nin nature like this!\c
I will start all over again.\nWe still have time.
Twist Mountain looks complicated, but\nbasically, it's a single road.\c\nKeep cool and move forward!\nThat is the trick to reach the goal.
Being with Pokémon is natural.\nHaving a Pokémon battle is natural.\r\nWhy don't we test whether that is true?\c
We are happy to be with our Pokémon.\nThat's why we have battles!
If my Pokémon don't want to fight,\nI will quit being a Trainer.\c\nBecause there are a lot of other things\nI can do with my Pokémon.
Oh! \nMy groundbreaking research...
Prepare at least three Pokémon\nthat can fight!\c\nRotation Battles are new battles\nwith three Pokémon!
Way to go!
They were rotating too much!
Rotation Battles are shocking!!
Rotation Battles are Pokémon battles\nwith three Pokémon!\r\nSo prepare at least three Pokémon!
Today I am extremely lucky!
I didn't expect them to turn that way.\nI am so unlucky!
Huh! \nI was just unlucky today.
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\nin which you use three Pokémon!\c\nPlease get three Pokémon together\nto use in battle!
OK! I will show you the results\nof my daily workouts!
The result of my daily workout...\ndidn't really show up.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
In order to have a Triple Battle,\nyou need to have at least three\r\nPokémon able to battle.
OK, everyone!\nLet's fight together!
Your Pokémon fought\nharder than mine!
There are so many things to consider,\nbut that is part of the fun of\r\nTriple Battles!
I choose a move, and\nmy Pokémon will do the move.\c\nIn a moment, that move will\nreach your Pokémon!\c
I lost, but during the battle,\nwe were connected. Right?
This Berry may connect\nyou and your Pokémon.\c
From today to tomorrow...\npeople, Pokémon, and the world...\c\nI love this connected feeling...
I am not running now,\nbut I usually barrel through\r\nas quickly as I can!\c
I have not crossed\nthe finish line of victory!
I'm going to use this little rest\nto give you this present!\c
Run and run in cities\nand on mountain paths!\c\nRun and feel the world around you\nwith your whole being!
I am just watching\nthe dangling tip of the fishhook.\c\nSince you and I have met, let's send\nour Pokémon out to meet in battle!\c
Because I love fishing and Pokémon,\nI enjoy my life twice as much.
The dangling tip of the fishhook.\nI am just watching it.\c\nYes, in life, even meaningless things\ncan have meaning.
Ouch... Why are you\nso strong?
Wow! Wow! Great!\nYou are stroooong!!
Hey! \nYour team is strong!
Ouch... I'm so uncool...
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.\nJust kidding!
Your strength...\nAnd my strength... Right. Let's test them.
Can you be strong even if you lose?\nIs winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.\nBut what is it to be truly strong?
Your strength...\nAnd my strength... Right. Let's test them.

Can you be strong even if you lose?\nIs winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.\nBut what is it to be truly strong?
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle\nthat uses three Pokémon.\c\nPlease prepare at least three Pokémon\nfor battle!
The flow of a game changes\nevery turn in a Rotation Battle!\r\nCan you master it?\c
It made my head spin,\nand I feel dizzy...
While a come-from-behind win is possible,\nif you are a strong Trainer,\r\nyou can handle the game well.\r\nThat is the thrill of Rotation Battles!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\nin which you use three Pokémon!\c\nPlease get three Pokémon together\nto use in battle!
I thought and thought\nand chose these three!\r\nTheir destructive force is overwhelming!\c
Did I position them wrong?\nOr is there a more fundamental problem?
Which Pokémon\nshould I put in the middle...?\r\nI'm still thinking about it.
My!\nSpecial Emolga?!
Fishermen read the flow of water\nor the flow of a battle!\c
The flow of the battle...\nIt's too wild to follow!
The flow of water here on Route 17\nis very wild.\c\nIf you don't tap into it well,\nyou cannot go where you want!
I am good at backstroke,\nfreestyle, butterfly...\r\nAnd, of course, Pokémon battles!\c
Did I just lose a Pokémon battle,\neven though I'm so good at them??
Shall I practice my swimming?\nOr shall I train my Pokémon?\c\nHmmmm, it's hard to decide,\nso I will swim with my Pokémon!
The Pokémon is riding the wave,\nand you are riding the Pokémon.\r\nAre you riding high?\c
The big wave has come and gone...\nMy heart is calm...
If you can surf calmly through the\nrough waters of your life,\r\nyou'll be riding high!
I learned all the good points of my\nAlomomola by swimming with Pokémon!\r\nI will show off its strength!\c
What a fresh Trainer!\nReally fresh, fresh!
I'm a girl with everything...\c\nWell, everything but a place to\nput my Poké Balls!
I was taking a little break, but hey,\nI always have time for Pokémon battles!\r\nLet's enjoy it as much as possible!\c
Wooosh!\nSsshhhh!!
I'll tell you why I was taking a break.\c\nI have trouble with my bikini.\nIt could be washed away...
Did you come here by looking\nat the Town Map, too?\c\nMaps are good.\nThey tell you a lot of things!\c
I want something that's like a map but\ntells me how to fight instead of where to go.
Where shall I go next...?\nI use the Town Map to decide!
I came all the way here\nlooking for various Pokémon.\c\nLet me see what kinds of Pokémon\nyou came here with!\c
Your Pokémon is...\nVery cool!!
There are Pokémon Trainers\nacross the water, too.\c\nI wonder what kinds\nof Pokémon and Trainers live there...
Fights have their own rhythms!\c\nI wonder whose Pokémon\ncan fight rhythmically.\c
Your Pokémon!\nTheir movements are right on the beat!
I am living with so many rhythms!\c\nMy rhythm, the Pokémon's rhythm,\nand nature's rhythm...
When I look down from a high place,\nI feel very good!\c\nPokémon battles are the same!\nI will fight looking down from the heights!\c
You're great!\nI can't help but look up to you!
We climb mountains because,\nno matter how hard it is,\r\nthe higher we climb,\r\nthe closer we get to the sky!
On a small rise of land...\nyou and I face each other...\c
On a small rise of land,\nI lost and was left speechless...
On a small rise of land...\nWhat am I seeing...?\c\nSo many Trainers I faced before...\c\nHow many more Trainers I can fight...\nI will cherish every battle.
Are you going deeper into Pinwheel\nForest? Or to the challenge rock?\c\nEither way, unless you are tough,\nyou'll be just rooted to the spot!\c
Oh, my...\nYou are very tough!
Tough Trainer!\nI will make your Pokémon healthy.\c
Around Pinwheel Forest, many Pokémon\nuse moves to inflict problems such as\r\npoison and paralysis.\r\nIf anything happens, let me know!
Really bad!
Zowie-e-e-e!
Mmmmm...?!\nThat's how you showed up?\c
Your power exceeds my\npsychic power!
People say the Musharna that show up\nhere every Friday are a bit different.
This is a power spot!\nIt awakens your dormant power!\c
Did you spot my weakness?
To tell you the truth,\neverybody has Dream Mist.\c\n'Cause if you can make a dream come true,\nit's the same as having Dream Mist.\r\nRight?
Eeek! Why? I foresaw your move,\nand I was running away from you.\c
Eeek! I foresaw your thoughts,\nbut I lost!
Dreams slip away when they almost\ncome true...\c\nIf you don't grab important things tight,\nyou will lose them.
To research strange Pokémon, having a\nbattle is a good approach.\c\nDon't you think?\c
I cannot help but wonder...\nWhy did I lose?
No matter how much you research,\nPokémon are full of new discoveries!
I've been researching\nwithout sleeping for days.\r\nI see you, but are you a dream?\c
Theoretically, it's impossible!\nIs this a dream...?
Talking about dreams, Fennel's\nPokémon DW!\r\nThat is some great research!\r\nAre you doing Game Sync, too?
For my research on dreams,\nI will research your dream!\c
No! \nI may dream about this defeat later!
The Dream Mist of the\nPokémon Musharna...\c\nThe secret has not been unlocked,\nbut it must be a great ability.
I want to figure out\nPsychics' strange powers!\c
I decided to fight using pure logic,\nyet I lost!
The things we can explain with logic\nare half of the world...\c\nThe rest, we explain with feeling!\nBecause the world is full of wonders.
Permets-moi de te provoquer en duel afin\nque je puisse graver notre rencontre\r\ndans ma mémoire.\c
Notre combat est à jamais gravé\ndans ma mémoire!
Les paysages que nous avons admirés...\nLes gens que nous avons rencontrés...\c\nLes Pokémon avec qui nous avons\ncroisé le fer...\c\nIls resteront à jamais gravés\ndans ma mémoire.
Tu n'imagineras jamais le nombre de\npays que j'ai visités, et le nombre\r\nde Dresseurs que j'ai combattus!\c
Wah!\nEncore un formidable souvenir de voyage!
Quand j'aurai beaucoup, beaucoup\nvoyagé, je rentrerai à la maison,\r\net je pourrai raconter tout\r\nplein de choses à ma famille!
The power of thundering waterfalls...\c\nExperience the great power\nof a battle with me!\c
I cannot believe our attack\nhad no impact on you!!
I admit your strength\nand give you this gift!\c
Maybe I should train my body and mind\nby standing under a waterfall!
My Pokémon and I spend so much time\ntogether, we don't need words\r\nto understand one another.\c\nDo you think you can win against us?\c
You can understand each other\nvery well, too!
When you see this Berry,\nplease remember us!\c
I enjoy working as a Ranger, but I love\nto spend my time with Pokémon!\c\nWhatever happens, I won't leave\nmy Pokémon!
Are you raising these Pokémon all alone?\nOr do you rely on Pokémon Day Care?\c
I was only thinking about Eggs...
Share this Berry with\nyour precious Pokémon!\c
The Pokémon Day Care on Route 3!\c\nIf you leave two Pokémon there,\nyou may find an Egg!
My Pokémon are running around\nin this beautiful grassland...\r\nPlease take a look!\c
They were bouncing around\njust a few minutes ago!
Share the Berry with your Pokémon, too!\c
They must have been tired\nbecause they were running around.\r\nAww! So cute!
It's OK to have a battle\nduring a picnic. Right?\c
Fey: Your Pokémon are\ngreat friends, aren't they?\c\nSue: It was over while I was\nconsidering what my partner would do.
I think the Pokémon in the Poké Balls\ntotally understand how you feel!
We two are having a picnic together!\nDon't you have two Pokémon?
We will rattle you and your Pokémon\nwith our perfect combination.\c

To battle well in a Double Battle,\nwe have to know\r\nour partner's Pokémon moves.
We fight as a duo.\nSo you need at least two Pokémon.
I was checking for Pokémon\naround here just now,\r\nbut I am also interested in you.\c
Oh! \nWhat interesting Pokémon!
Even similar Pokémon will have\ndifferent behavior and appearances\r\nin Unova and other regions.
I was checking the landscape\naround here just now,\r\nbut I am also interested in you.\c
Oh, my!\nWhat an interesting Trainer!
The unevenness of this landscape...\nWe can tell that the flow of a river\r\ncreated the undulation.
From my point of view,\nart is feeling and logic!\c\nAnd a beautiful battle is also\nfeeling and logic!\c
I could not see your strength?!
Artists can be divided\ninto two types...\c\nSome draw what they see,\nand some draw what they can't see!
I am a wonderful Fisherman\nwho loves everything!\c\nThis Fisherman will fight\nwith wonderful Pokémon!!\c
I lost!\nBut I still love everything!
I want to go deep-sea fishing\nusing the Royal Unova\r\nthat leaves from Castelia City!
Don't be overwhelmed\nby my awesome Pokémon!\c
I'm so overwhelmed that I cannot speak...
Is my fishing rod bad?\nOr is it my fishing skill that's bad?\r\nI always catch the same Pokémon.
Hm! You look like a competent\nPokémon Trainer!\c\nIf I have a battle with you,\nI may learn some secrets!\c
Yep! A strong person is strong.\nAnd a weak person is weak.
The secret of fishing...\nIsn't it “hurry up slowly"?
Hey! Please show me what kinds\nof great Pokémon you have caught!\c
Ho ho!\nThese are some impressive Pokémon!
Even if others catch great Pokémon,\nI won't get jealous.\c\nBecause my own Pokémon\nare the best ones for me!
Our Pokémon make a nice matchup!\c
Emy: No, I can't believe it!\nHow come you're so strong?\c\nLin: Our team is the best in the whole world\never! How did you beat us?
If Pokémon are good friends,\nthey will be filled with power!
What? Only one Pokémon?\nThen, we can't fight!
Our combination is the best!\nThere is no chance we will ever lose!\c

The Abilities called Plus and Minus\nare the best combination! Right?
What? Only one Pokémon?\nSorry, we won't battle with you!
While we watch the beautiful scenery,\nlet's have an exciting Pokémon battle!\c
I was absorbed in our Pokémon battle.
The quiet sound of a multitude of waves\nendlessly overlapping...\c\nIt's like a first-class orchestra...\nDoesn't it sound like that?
I will keep walking\non the sandy beach...\c\nHow about that?\nSounds pretty great, doesn't it?\c
I'd have more fun\njust walking on the beach...
I walk on the sandy beach...\c\nBecause I love footprints!
Oh?\nA lovely Trainer.\c\nWould you like to meet the Pokémon\nthat make me proud?\c
Uh...\nShocking!!
...Looking back, when I had\nups and downs, my Pokémon\r\nwere always there for me.
Oh, a traveling Trainer!\nLet's battle, just for fun!\c
Huh? Is it already over? Noooo!\nI want to see more Pokémon!
When Pokémon use moves, or when they\nsee you and catch your eye, your heart\r\nbeats a little faster, doesn't it?
A woman standing alone with a parasol\nin one hand at the beach...\r\nHi... Please have a battle with me.\c
The parasol can block ultraviolet rays, \nbut it can't block moves...
I heard a parasol is a must\non the beach...\r\nBut I'm the only one who has one?
What? Will you fight against me?\nIt's OK, but are you strong?\c
Ugh...\nYour Pokémon are strong!
I'm happy when I am with my Pokémon!\c\nThat means I will be happy for years\nto come! Because I'm always with them!
If I battle until I win, I will never\nultimately lose!\c
Try seven times and fall eight times...\nNo!\r\nFall down seven times, stand up eight!
The more I rise up,\nthe stronger my mind grows!\c\nThat's why I thank you for each round\nthat I lost!
Do you understand why Trainers\nand Pokémon are together?\c
You and your Pokémon share\nthe sad feeling of losing half-and-half...
With a friend, you laugh twice for happy\nthings, and you cry half for sad ones.\r\nThat is the joy of living with Pokémon.
An expert Fisherman can time many things\nperfectly and precisely!\c
Hmmmm! A lot of my timing\ndidn't go well!
You! It's impressive that\nyou have a Super Rod!\c\nOK! Probably you know, but\nI will tell you how to use it!\c\nFirst, you face any body of water,\nthen you cast with your Super Rod.\c\nNext you must focus!\c\nWhen a Pokémon bites,\n“!" appears.\r\nThat's your cue to reel it in!
On a bridge!\nFighting Trainers!\r\nIt's a perfect picture!\c
I am not weak, even though I lost.\nYou, who won, are just too strong!
On a bridge!\nA sentimental Trainer after his defeat!\r\nThis is also a good, tragic picture!
My Pokémon climbed many mountains and\nbuilt up their physiques!\c
My tears fell after the defeat.\nWatch them become an ocean!
With the Pokémon move Waterfall,\na Pokémon can climb a waterfall!\c\n...There is no move called Mountainfall.
I will battle with you,\nbut you must relax your shoulders.\c\nBecause you need to relax\nto show your ability.\c
Natural stance!\nYou are good!
When people try to do what they can't,\nthey become clumsy.\c\nIf they do what they can do very well,\nthey can always be themselves!
I will unveil my Pokémon to you!\nThey are the best in the world!\c
Your Pokémon are also cute,\nbut my Pokémon are charming!
Listen. My love for my Pokémon\nis the best in the world.\r\nNobody can beat it.
Se ripenso a quante montagne\nho attraversato in lungo e in largo,\r\nmi viene tanta voglia di una lotta.\c
Vengono in mente altre lotte in\ncui ho perso proprio come adesso!
La strada percorsa non si cambia!\c\nMa su quella da percorrere\npuò accadere ancora di tutto!
What's wrong, Pokémon Trainer?\c\nAre you lost in your journey?\nNo... In your life? At times like that,\r\nif you fight, you'll know!\c
You have no doubts\nabout your way of fighting!
Such a strong Trainer!\nPlease accept this!\c
Life itself is a journey, and it's\nnatural to get lost sometimes!\c\nSome truths you can find\nonly when you get lost!
Yoo-hoo, Pokémon!\nYoo-hoo, Pokémonnnn!\r\nYoo-hoo, are you a Trainer?!\c
A tough Trainer,\nand a tough Pokémon. I lost.
I will give you this as a sign\nof my respect for your toughness!\c
I am checking to see whether Pokémon\nthat came from other regions\r\nby Poké Transfer have escaped.
I'm looking for a place...\nthat is not in any guidebook.\c
Your strength!\nI want to put it in a guidebook!
A journey to find something new!\nThat is my goal.\c\nFor example, that big rock!\nYou can push it with the move Strength!
Amazing, to find a quiet spot like this\nright next to the big city!\c\nWow! I got a little excited,\nso I want to have a battle!\c
Well, I have calmed down.
Do Pokémon also\nfeel calm in nature?\c\nOr do they also enjoy\nthe glitz of cities?
Because all roads are connected, I can\ngo anywhere and challenge anyone!\c
I felt the bond between\nyou and your Pokémon!
I keep traveling\nto forget my sadness...\c\nBut the sad memory returns\nevery time a season passes.
I ride a Bicycle,\nI feel fresh winds,\r\nand I win Pokémon battles!\c
A pleasant wind is carrying a defeat.\n...Now, it is stopping here, though.
Most people don't know this,\nbut coming to Nimbasa\r\nand riding a Bicycle is very popular.
Ting-a-ling-ling. ♪\c\nI will have a Pokémon battle\nat this speed!\c
I'm upset because I lost,\nso I will ring the bell. Ting-a-ling. ♪
If you ride a Bicycle,\nyou zip along!\c\nIf you are with Pokémon,\nyou can do many things.\c\nIt's fun to do things\nyou can't usually do!
I am patrolling.\nI will check your strength, too!\c
You were so strong\nthat I couldn't help falling back!
Nothing scares me\nwhen I patrol with my Pokémon!
I will show you the harshness\nof the desert through a battle!\c
Desert...hot... Mouth...dry... Grfrrrfl...
Be careful of burns!\c
If a Pokémon gets a burn, \nit also weakens physical attacks.\r\nThis works quite well!
Scorching desert!\nA passion for adventure!\r\nAnd a heated battle!\c
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!!
Speed is crucial\nto treat a burn!\c
Whether it is hot or cold,\nthere is no problem if you have passion!
But you are just so relaxed! How could you\nwin against a busy person like me?
Oh, my! How strong you are!
Oh!\nImpressive strength!
Oh... I lost.\nYou're very strong!
What?\nHow could I lose?
This...\nThis is ridiculous!
Your strength was more than I imagined!\nI am pleased!
Come on! Seriously?! All I did was\ntake away people's Pokémon.
We finally reached the secret sleeping in\nthe basement of the lighthouse.\r\nI won't let you interrupt us!\c
I am bitterly disappointed...
In the basement of the lighthouse\nbuilt over 200 years ago,\r\nthe mythical Pokémon\r\nVictini was sleeping!
I was ordered not to let anyone\napproach the Plasma Ship!\c
I lost the battle though...
Although I lost, I won't move!\nI will follow my orders!
We will release Victini\nfrom its confinement\r\nin a small basement on the island!\c
You're sabotaging\nour noble cause!
Selfish people are making\nVictini suffer...
The Victini on this island\ncreates limitless energy!\c
You are just a kid!
If you are exposed to Victini's energy,\nyou can win any kind of battle.
I failed to seize the victory!
The beginning is always important\nfor both battles and novels.
Oh... I guess it's time to start\nmy last chapter.
The epilogue of this story\nis about to begin.
Wow. I'm stunned.\c\nFor all the words I know, I can't figure out\nhow to say this... Putting my feelings\r\ninto words would just be a trap.\c\nAll I will say is I feel you're even greater\nthan I thought!
You use the move here...\nIt's good. It's fascinating.
Well... I've never withdrawn\nfrom any battles.
Even in this situation,\nthere must be a way...to win.
If somebody wins, the person who fought\nagainst that person will lose.\r\nThat's battle.\c\nA good contender just seeks the next\nvictory without bragging after winning,\r\nand without getting upset after losing.
Oh! Strong as usual.\nThat makes my heart dance!
The last one!\nI'll use the last bit of strength!
Oh... This may be the last.\nI will put everything into the next move!
There is no strongest Pokémon or single\nbest combination...\c\nSo, there are no guarantees of winning.\c\nBut the determination to be strong and to\ncontinue to grow and improve is itself a\r\ngreat strength. It's the determination\r\nthat you show that makes me respect you.
A wonderful time is about to start.\nI like this moment...
I will stay cool and collected, even though\nthis isn't going well...
I will not give up...for the sake of my\nPokémon that believe in me.
As you have always been...or even more\nthan ever...\r\nyou are an elegant and excellent Trainer.\c\nYour Pokémon also have class.\nI am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you really think you can stop us\nwith that?
My last friend...\nPlease share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you,\nand not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The ideals I held...\nThe dreams Pokémon shared...
Your Pokémon look happy.
Even if I lose, is it different from the\nfuture I saw?
The result was the same...\nBut you... Who are you?
When was the last time\nI was driven into a corner like this?
You haven't won yet! I won't let\nsuch a fun battle end so easily!
My heart is pounding so hard because I had\nsuch a heated battle with you.\c\nYou are a really great Trainer!!
I bought new boots,\nso I came all this way to get them dirty.\c\nYou're right! If I have a battle,\nthey may get even dirtier!\c
Oh! My boots got completely soaked\nin the battle!
I would feel sorry for boots\nif I cared about them getting dirty.\c\nPokémon are the same. Right?\nI feel sorry for them getting hurt,\r\nbut it makes them stronger.
If there are Trainers,\nI just have battles with them.\c\nBecause they may show me\nWater-type Pokémon\r\nI've never seen.\c
I've never seen\nsuch a strong Trainer!
If I find water, I drop in my fishing line.\c\nBecause even with a puddle,\nthere may be Pokémon\r\nthat I've never seen.
Knowing oneself, knowing the other,\nand knowing the surroundings...\r\nThat's a Ranger!\c
I guess there's still\na lot I don't know!
If you are prepared,\nyou don't have to worry!\c
I'm researching what kinds of\nPokémon live around here.\c\nThat way, I can plan which Pokémon\nI should take along.
Pokémon Trainers nurture friendship\nwith their battles!\c
This feeling of defeat...\nis like a bottomless swamp...
Please accept this Sitrus Berry\nas a token of our friendship!\c
Stay still and listen carefully!\nHear the sounds of nearby Pokémon...\r\nthe breath of trees and swamps.
I got tired of Pokémon battles\nwith the same people,\r\nso I want to have a battle with you!\c
Wow! Surprising!\nThe move just now was great!
The Pokémon called Burmy\ncan change their forms\r\ndepending on where they battle!\r\nIsn't that great??
Eeek!!\c\nHey! Don't sneak up\non me like that!\c
Argh, I lost again...\nI'm a little bit sad.
I was writing this and that on the wall.\c\nOh, I will never show it to you!\n...Because it's my secret!
Let's compare whose Pokémon\nare stronger!\c
You won!\nYour Pokémon are awesome!
I scrape my legs a lot\n'cause I'm wearing shorts.\c\nBut I'm fine!\c\nMy Pokémon lick the scraped parts!
This is our playground!\c\nGreat Landorus, watch out for us!\c
Wahaha!\nYour Pokémon looks like it is having fun!
Great Landorus...\nIs it a strong and kind Pokémon?
If you have the move Dive,\nyou can dive and sink!\c
Blub, blub, blub...\n...I am sinking.
Have your Pokémon\nlearned the move Dive?\c\nDive is good! Great!\n'Cause it's Dive!
I just love swimming, so I have only\nfought against wild Pokémon.\c
I guess people get strong\nby visiting Gyms!
OK! I will challenge Pokémon in Gyms\nall over the world!\c\nWhere do I find Water-type Gyms...\nKanto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh, right?
My Pokémon and I are always swimming.\nOf course, I can battle while swimming!\c
I lost. But I'm still cool, because not many\npeople can say they battled while swimming!
They say a temple sank\nto the ocean floor in Undella!
Seeing a Pokémon use its best moves\nagainst another Pokémon\r\nis really an adventure!\c
The adventure is over already.
I am on vacation\nall year round...
Oh? Did you come here to see\nCynthia in a bathing suit?\c
You should put on a bathing suit and swim\ninstead of riding on a Pokémon!
I heard that Cynthia swims secretly\nwhen nobody else is around.\c\nAnd I heard she is great!\nJust great!
The sea waves in Undella Town are\nnice and calm!\c
Your battling style\nis very rough and ready!
Floating in the sea, very nice!\nBeing with Pokémon, very nice!
What I learned after reading many books\nis that there are still a lot of mysteries\r\nin the world!\c
How we can be friendlier with Pokémon\nis also a mystery.
The book I am reading now was\nwritten by Professor Juniper.\c\nIt says the origin of Pokémon\nis still a mystery.
I've been researching the Village Bridge,\nbut taking a break is also important!\c
You and your Pokémon!\nYou are supporting each other perfectly!
In the Village Bridge,\na lot of bricks support each other\r\nand keep the bridge from collapsing.\c\nThat's how the bridge has kept its shape\nfor over 100 years.
My journey has taught me\nthat everybody loves Pokémon!\r\nI'm sure you love them, too.\c
Although we lost,\nour journey will still continue!
We will keep walking!\nAs long as the road goes on...\r\nAs long as I am with my Pokémon!
You are the 99th person\nthat I have greeted this way.\c\nLet's have a Pokémon battle!\c
Thank you! Now you and I are friends.\nRight?
If we could greet anyone in the world\nwith “Let's have a Pokémon battle!"\r\nthat would be wonderful!
My movements lack power!
I was off the beat!\nI have to start up my lessons again!
My footwork was not quite sharp.
Plasmaaaa!\nI have fallen in the Relic Castle...
The strength that beat my lord N.\nI see... It cut me to the bone.
That strength has protected\nthe world in which people and Pokémon\r\nlive together.
I will use everything that I've learned on\nthis journey!
My Pokémon and I will\nput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\nYou are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned on\nthis journey!
My Pokémon and I will\nput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\nYou are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned on\nthis journey!
My Pokémon and I will\nput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\nYou are really great.
Did you see how I trained it?
Did you see how I trained it?
I trained the Pokémon you traded me\nvery well, right?
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.
I'm a heartbreaker...\nMy name... Charles.
I know all my strengths and weaknesses now.\nSoon, I will also know yours!
It's not over yet.\nMy Pokémon are with me!
I believe in my Pokémon's strength,\nso I don't lose my calm.
Thank you!\nI saw what was missing in me.
I know all my strengths and weaknesses now.\nSoon, I will also know yours!

Thank you!\nI saw what was missing in me.
I see...\nYou choose that move?!
S-s-still... That's fine.\nWe're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,\nI am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!\nI definitely learned something!

Triple Battles are battles with\nthree Pokémon!\c\nPlease get three Pokémon ready\nfor battle!
Which Pokémon you use...\c\nYes! Preparation before a battle\nis very important for Triple Battles!\r\nNow, let's start!\c
Be ready! Stay prepared so\nyou can battle anytime!
They say chance favors\nthe prepared mind.
Rotation Battles are battles\nwith three Pokémon!\c\nI want you to prepare at least\nthree Pokémon for a fight!
Which Pokémon you use...\c\nYes! Preparation before a battle\nis very important for Rotation Battles!\r\nNow, let's start!\c
Be ready! Stay prepared so\nyou can battle anytime!
They say chance favors\nthe prepared mind.
Triple Battles are new battles\nwith three Pokémon!\c\nYou cannot fight if you don't have\nat least three Pokémon.
Triple Battles are three-on-three\nPokémon battles.\c\nI will overpower you with\nmy perfect combination\r\nand overwhelming attack power!\c
Did I overthink it\nbecause of the unfamiliar rules?
The balance of three Pokémon...\neach with its own role...\r\nI still have to do more research.
Rotation Battles are new battles\nwith three Pokémon!\c\nYou can't battle if you don't have\nat least three Pokémon.
Rotation Battles are\nnew Pokémon battles\r\nin which the positions always change.\c\nI will overpower you\nwhile you are confused!\c
Did I overthink it\nbecause of the unfamiliar rules?

A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\nin which you use three Pokémon!\c\nPlease get three Pokémon together\nto use in battle!
Let me test what fighting style\nis more effective!\c
By any chance, are you a\nTriple Battle genius?!
If you'd like, please have\nTriple Battles with your friends.
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle\nthat uses three Pokémon.\c\nPlease prepare at least three Pokémon\nfor battle!
Let me test what fighting style\nis more effective!\c
By any chance, are you a\nRotation Battle genius?!
Now you can have Rotation Battles with\nyour friends!
Great plans are\nalways interrupted.
You... You are the Trainer\nthat my lord N is worried about!\c
You may have beaten me, but you're still no\nbetter than other Trainers around here.
My lord N grew up with Pokémon...\c\nHe thinks about Pokémon more than\nanybody else!
I will hurt anyone\nwho disobeys Team Plasma!\c
Ouch, ouuuuch!\nMy Pokémon got hurt!
You, before you came here,\nhow many Pokémon did you hurt?
I am a Trainer first\nand a Doctor second!\c
Whenever I meet a Trainer,\nI can't help having a battle...
Now, I will make\nyour Pokémon healthy!\c
Desert Resort is a harsh place.\nDo you have medicines?
The more I fight along with my Pokémon,\nthe happier I will be!\c
I lost, but I am happy!\nBecause I have learned a few things!
Thinking about being happy\nand making happiness a reality...\r\nThis is also science.
Ugh!\nYou choose a good move, as usual.
With my knowledge, I can bring out\nthe strength of my Pokémon!
Why do you keep beating me?\c\nWe have the same number of Gym Badges.\nWe should be equals in strength...
Ugh!\nYou choose a good move, as usual.

Ooohhh...\nAm I in trouble?
I trained with Iris...\nBut I still couldn't win...
My Pokémon and me!\nWe trained and got tough!
Ooohhh...\nAm I in trouble?

My Pokémon and me!\nWe trained and got tough!
Ooohhh...\nAm I in trouble?
I trained with Iris...\nBut I still couldn't win...
Way to go!
They were rotating too much!
If that is the move you chose\nafter serious consideration, that's fine!
Woooo! Your inexhaustible fighting spirit!\nImpressive!
Am I being overpowered?!\nThis is nothing! I will overpower you!
After the battle, a fresh wind\nblew through my heart...\c\nUse the battle with me as a stepping stone\nand move forward!

Wow... As I thought, it's high...\nAh... I may be getting scared...
Ugh... It's swaying... Isn't it? It is!\nI'm scared of how high up we are...
Ahh... No, no... This is my limit.\nHere... Sit a little closer, OK?
It's getting higher and higher...\nUlp. This is going faster than I thought.
Oh! Come look here!\nLook! Ulp, I'm not feeling so good...
... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...
I thought I'd enjoy this ride, but I feel\nlike I'm enclosed in a tiny little space...
Luckily, I'm not scared of heights.\nThat would not be cool for a Hiker.
I'm gonna stay cool. Feel cool on the\ninside, look cool on the outside.
Uh-oh. It's higher than I thought.\nUlp. It's swaying more than I expected.
Oh! Don't move! We'll fall!\nDo...not...move...
Eep... I can't take it. This is my limit.\nW-w-will you hold my hand?
It's a great view... G-great...\nB-b-but...
I'm not crying. I'm not...\nSorry... Can I sit next to you?
Just...just until we start to descend...\nPlease...stay...
Um-hmm...\nSince we have time, shall we talk?
Um-hm... That's right... No way!\nThen... Um-hmm... Yes, yes... Um-hm...
Said...I like you... Such a lie.\nIt turned out there was... Uh-huh...
Yay! Yaaaay! It's going round and round!\nYaaay! Yaaaay! It's going up and up!
Yaaaay! So high up! Up in the sky!\nHee hee. It's fun!
Look how far we can see!\nLook! Please, Trainer?
The city is getting smaller and smaller...\nSuch a pretty sight...
Krrf! Krrrf! Krrrf!\nSorry... It's a bit chilly for me...
I think it's finally warming up. I'm\nfeeling better. Thanks for the company.

For some time after its birth, it\ngrows by gaining nourishment from\nthe seed on its back.
When the bud on its back starts\nswelling, a sweet aroma wafts to\nindicate the flower's coming bloom.
After a rainy day, the flower on\nits back smells stronger. The\nscent attracts other Pokémon.
The fire on the tip of its tail is a\nmeasure of its life. If healthy,\nits tail burns intensely.
In the rocky mountains where\nCharmeleon live, their fiery\ntails shine at night like stars.
It is said that Charizard's fire\nburns hotter if it has\nexperienced harsh battles.
It shelters itself in its shell,\nthen strikes back with spouts of\nwater at every opportunity.
It is said to live 10,000 years.\nIts furry tail is popular as a\nsymbol of longevity.
The jets of water it spouts from\nthe rocket cannons on its shell\ncan punch through thick steel.
It releases a stench from its red\nantenna to repel enemies. It\ngrows by molting repeatedly.
A steel-hard shell protects its\ntender body. It quietly endures\nhardships while awaiting evolution.
It loves the honey of flowers and\ncan locate flower patches that\nhave even tiny amounts of pollen.
It eats its weight in leaves every\nday. It fends off attackers with\nthe needle on its head.
While awaiting evolution, it\nhides from predators under\nleaves and in nooks of branches.
Its best attack involves flying\naround at high speed, striking with\npoison needles, then flying off.
It is docile and prefers to avoid\nconflict. If disturbed, however,\nit can ferociously strike back.
It flies over its wide territory in\nsearch of prey, downing it\nwith its highly developed claws.
By flapping its wings with all its\nmight, Pidgeot can make a gust of\nwind capable of bending tall trees.
Cautious in the extreme, its\nhardy vitality lets it live in\nany kind of environment.
It whittles its constantly growing\nfangs by gnawing on hard things.\nIt can chew apart cinder walls.
It flaps its small wings busily to\nfly. Using its beak, it searches\nin grass for prey.
It has the stamina to fly all\nday on its broad wings. It\nfights by using its sharp beak.
It sneaks through grass without\nmaking a sound and strikes\nunsuspecting prey from behind.
The pattern on its belly is for\nintimidation. It constricts foes\nwhile they are frozen in fear.
It occasionally uses an electric\nshock to recharge a fellow Pikachu\nthat is in a weakened state.
Its tail discharges electricity into\nthe ground, protecting it from\ngetting shocked.
To protect itself from attackers,\nit curls up into a ball. It lives in\narid regions with minimal rainfall.
It curls up, then rolls into foes\nwith its back. Its sharp spines\ninflict severe damage.
While it does not prefer to fight,\neven one drop of the poison it\nsecretes from barbs can be fatal.
When it senses danger, it raises\nall the barbs on its body. These\nbarbs grow slower than Nidorino's.
Its entire body is armored with\nhard scales. It will protect the\nyoung in its burrow with its life.
It scans its surroundings by\nraising its ears out of the grass.\nIts toxic horn is for protection.
It has a violent disposition and\nstabs foes with its horn, which\noozes poison upon impact.
One swing of its mighty tail can\nsnap a telephone pole as if it were\na matchstick.
It is said that happiness will come\nto those who see a gathering of\nClefairy dancing under a full moon.
It is very wary and rarely shows\nitself to people. Its ears can hear\na pin drop over half a mile away.
It controls balls of fire. As it\ngrows, its six tails split from\ntheir tips to make more tails.
Its nine tails are said to be\nimbued with a mystic power.\nIt can live for a thousand years.
When it wavers its big, round\neyes, it begins singing a lullaby\nthat makes everyone drowsy.
Its fine fur feels sublime to the\ntouch. It can expand its body by\ninhaling air.
It checks its surroundings and\nlocation using reflections of the\nultrasonic waves from its mouth.

태어나서부터 얼마 동안은\n등의 씨앗으로부터 영양을 \n공급받아 크게 성장한다.
등의 봉오리가 부풀어오르면\n달콤한 냄새가 감돌기 시작한다.\n큰 꽃이 필 조짐이다.
비가 내린 다음 날은 등의\n꽃향기가 강해진다. 향기에\n이끌려 포켓몬이 모여든다.
파이리 꼬리의 불꽃은\n생명의 등불이다. 건강할 때는\n불꽃도 강하게 타오른다.
리자드가 사는 바위산을\n한밤중에 올려다보면 꼬리의\n불꽃이 별처럼 보인다.
힘든 싸움을 경험한\n리자몽일수록 불꽃 온도가\n높아진다고 전해진다.
등껍질에 숨어 몸을 보호한다.\n상대의 빈틈을 놓치지 않고\n물을 뿜어내어 반격한다.
만년의 수명을 가지고 있다고들\n말한다. 치렁치렁한 꼬리는\n장수의 상징으로써 인기가 있다.
등껍질의 로켓포로부터 뿜어내는\n수류는 두꺼운 철판도\n한 번에 꿰뚫는 파괴력이 있다.
빨간 더듬이로부터 냄새를\n내어 상대를 쫓아 버린다.\n탈피를 반복하여 자라게 된다.
강철같이 단단한 껍질로\n부드러운 몸을 보호하고 있다.\n진화할 때까지 가만히 참고 있다.
꽃의 꿀을 매우 좋아한다.\n약간의 꽃가루만으로 꽃밭이 \n있는 장소를 찾아낼 수 있다.
매일 자신과 똑같은 무게의\n잎사귀를 먹는다. 머리의 침으로\n달려드는 상대를 물리친다.
천적에 발견되지 않도록\n잎사귀 뒷면이나 가지의 틈새에\n숨어서 진화할 때를 기다린다.
고속으로 날아다니며 독침으로\n공격한 뒤 바로 날아가 버리는\n전법이 특기다.
싸움을 좋아하지 않는 얌전한\n성격이지만 어설프게 건드리면\n강력한 반격을 당하게 된다.
넓은 영역을 날아다니며\n먹이를 찾는다. 발달한 발톱으로\n먹이를 꼼짝 못하게 한다.
피죤투가 힘껏 날개를 치면 \n큰 나무도 휠 정도의\n강풍을 일으킨다.
어떤 장소에도 정착하여\n살아갈 수 있는 생명력이 있다.\n경계심이 매우 강하다.
계속 자라는 앞니를 갈아내려고\n딱딱한 것을 갉는 습성이 있다.\n벽돌로 된 벽도 갉아서 부순다.
작은 날개를 쉴 새 없이 쳐서\n날아오른다. 풀밭에 있는\n먹이를 부리로 찾아낸다.
큰 날개로 온종일\n날아다닐 수 있는 체력의 소유자다.\n날카로운 부리로 싸운다.
소리를 전혀 내지 않고 풀밭\n속을 나아간다. 방심하고 있는\n먹이를 배후에서 덮친다.
배의 무늬로 상대를 위협한다.\n무늬에 겁을 먹고 움직일 수 없게 된\n사이에 몸으로 조인다.
약해진 동료 피카츄에게\n전기를 흘려보내 쇼크를 줘서\n힘을 나눠주는 때도 있다.
꼬리가 어스 역할을 하여\n전기를 지면으로 흘려보내\n자신은 감전되거나 하지 않는다.
비가 거의 내리지 않는\n건조한 토지에 서식한다.\n몸을 둥글게 말아서 몸을 보호한다.
몸을 둥글게 말아서 등으로\n몸통박치기한다. 날카로운\n가시들이 큰 데미지를 준다.
싸움을 좋아하지 않는 성격이다.\n독침에서 분비된 독은\n한 방울만 맞아도 생명을 빼앗긴다.
위험을 느끼면 전신의 가시를\n곤두세운다. 니드리노에 비해서\n가시의 성장이 느리다.
갑옷처럼 단단한 비늘이\n전신을 둘러싼다. 둥지의\n새끼를 목숨 걸고 지킨다.
풀밭 위로 귀만 내어\n주위의 낌새를 살핀다.\n맹독의 뿔로 몸을 보호한다.
기질이 거친 포켓몬이다.\n상대를 깊이 찌른 충격으로\n뿔에서 맹독이 배어 나온다.
꼬리의 일격은 전신주를\n마치 성냥개비 다루듯이\n두 동강으로 꺾어 버린다.
보름달 밤에 삐삐가 모여\n춤을 추는 모습을 보면\n행복해진다고 전해진다.
1km 앞에 떨어진 바늘 소리를 듣고\n구별하는 귀와 조심성 많은 성격으로\n좀처럼 사람 앞에 나타나지 않는다.
불꽃의 구슬을 조종한다.\n성장하면 6개의 꼬리는\n끝이 갈라져서 한층 더 늘어난다.
9개의 꼬리에는 신비한 힘이\n깃들어 있다고 전해진다.\n천 년을 살 수 있는 듯하다.
동그란 눈동자가 흔들릴 때\n누구나 잠이 오게 되는\n자장가를 부르기 시작한다.
세밀한 털은 결이 매우 고와\n감촉이 최고로 좋다.\n숨을 들이마셔서 몸을 부풀린다.
입에서 나오는 초음파를\n반사하는 것으로 주변의 상황이나\n자신이 있는 곳을 조사하고 있다.
아무리 단단한 피부라도 뚫는 예리한\n송곳니에는 작은 구멍이 있어서\n그 구멍으로 피를 빤다.
낮에는 뿌리인 발을 땅에 박고\n움직이지 않을 때가 많다.\n밤에 돌아다니며 씨를 뿌린다.
입에서 흘러내리는 꿀은\n2km 떨어져 있어도 코가\n비뚤어질 정도의 심한 악취가 난다.
세계에서 꽃잎이 제일 크다.\n심한 알레르기를 일으킬\n독 꽃가루를 흩뿌리며 걷는다.
동충하초라고 불리는\n버섯을 등에 기르고 있다.\n파라스와 함께 크게 자란다.
몸보다 큰 버섯이\n파라섹트를 조종하고 있다.\n독 포자를 여기저기 뿌린다.
작은 눈이 많이 모여\n큰 눈을 이루고 있다.\n밤이 되면 불빛을 향해 모여든다.
날개를 쳐서 날개 가루를 흩뿌린다.\n날개 가루가 몸에 붙으면\n독 성분이 피부에 스며든다.
땅속에서 살고 있는 포켓몬이다.\n어두운 지하에 있기 때문에\n밝은 태양을 싫어한다.
3개의 머리가 교차하며 움직여서\n아무리 딱딱한 지층이라도\n지하 100km까지 파들어 간다.
한밤중에 움직이는 습성이 있다.\n반짝반짝 빛나는 것을 발견하면\n그에 못지 않게 눈동자가 반짝인다.
자존심이 센 포켓몬이다.\n마니아 사이에서는 이마의\n보석 크기가 화제가 된다.
이상한 능력을 주체 못하여\n언제나 두통에 시달리고 있다.\n가끔 이상한 힘을 쓴다.
손바닥의 발달한 물갈퀴를 써서\n다이내믹하게, 그리고 품위있게\n헤엄치는 모습을 볼 수 있다.
나무 위에서 생활하고 있다.\n무리 중 1마리가 화내기 시작하면\n모두 아무 의미도 없이 난동부린다.
시선을 마주치기만 해도 화내고\n도망치면 또 화내고\n때려눕혀도 계속 화를 낸다. 
충실한 성격의 포켓몬이다.\n트레이너의 명령이 있기 전까진\n한 발짝도 움직이지 않는다.
위풍당당한 모습은\n오래전부터 사람들의 마음을\n사로잡아 왔다.
내장이 들여다보일 정도로\n피부가 얇다. 막 자란\n다리는 걷는 것이 서투르다.
배의 소용돌이는 미묘하게\n꾸불거리므로 바라보고 있으면\n점점 잠이 오게 된다.
강인한 근육을 가지고 있다.\n태평양을 쉬지 않고\n계속 헤엄칠 수 있다.
초능력을 쓴 뒤에는\n뇌가 지쳐버리기 때문에\n하루에 18시간이나 잔다.
은 숟가락을 바라보고\n정신을 통일하고 있으면\n발산하는 알파파가 증가한다.
양손에 지니고 있는 숟가락은\n후딘의 초능력으로\n만들어낸 것이라고 전해진다.
작은 몸집이지만 힘이 세다.\n꼬마돌쯤은 몇 마리라도 한꺼번에\n가뿐히 들어올려서 날려버린다.
몸을 단련하고자 기분 좋게\n무거운 짐을 날라주기에\n사람을 대신하여 힘을 쓰는 일을 한다.
4개의 힘센 팔은\n눈에 보이지 않을 정도로 빠르게\n펀치와 당수를 날린다.
고온다습한 땅을 좋아한다.\n덩굴을 뻗어서 먹이를 잡을 때의\n움직임은 매우 재빠르다.
식물과 똑 닮은 포켓몬이다.\n방심해서 가까이 다가온 먹이에게\n독가루를 뿌려서 잡는다.
꿀같은 향기의 액체를\n입에 모아두고 있지만 그것은\n무엇이든 녹이는 용해액이다.
몸 대부분이 수분이어서\n파도에 밀려 모래 해변에\n올려지면 바싹 말라버린다.
80개의 촉수를 길게 뻗어\n독의 포위망을 만들어 낸다.\n붙잡히면 도망치기 어렵다.
움직이지 않고 있으면 돌멩이로\n착각하여 무심코 밟게 되는데\n그러면 주먹을 휘두르며 화를 낸다.
산길을 굴러서 이동한다.\n기세가 극에 오르면 어떤\n포켓몬도 이를 멈출 수 없다.
암석 같은 단단한 몸은\n다이너마이트로도 상처를\n입힐 수 없다. 1년에 1번 탈피한다.
막 태어나서는 겨우 일어설 수 있을\n정도이지만 많이 달리면 하반신이\n단련되어 달리는 속도가 빨라진다.
전력으로 달릴 때는\n타오르는 갈기에서 빛이 나\n한층 더 아름답게 보인다.
움직임은 느리지만 꼬리를 사용하는\n낚시가 특기다. 둔감하므로\n꼬리를 물려도 아프지 않다. 
멍하게 있는 야도란이지만\n셀러가 강하게 꼬리를 물 때\n무언가가 번뜩이는 듯하다.
좌우에 있는 유닛을\n고속으로 회전시킬수록\n그 자력이 강해진다.
태양의 흑점이 늘어나면\n왠지 레어코일이 많아져서\nTV가 선명하게 보이지 않게 된다.
파 줄기가 없으면 살 수 없다.\n그래서 파 줄기를 노리는 상대와는\n목숨을 걸고 싸운다.
두 머리에 각각 존재하는 뇌는\n텔레파시같은 힘으로\n의사를 맞춰나가는 듯하다.
진화할 때 두두의 머리 중 한쪽이\n분열되는 희귀종.\n시속 60km 이상으로 달린다.
빙산에 사는 포켓몬이다.\n머리의 뾰족하게 돌출된 부분으로\n얼음을 깨고 바다를 헤엄친다.
전신이 새하얀 털로\n덮여 있기 때문에 눈 속에서는\n천적에 발견되지 않는다.
시궁창의 진흙이 달로부터의\nX선을 쬐어 태어났다.\n더러운 장소에서 나타난다.
몸에서 맹독의 체액이\n배어 나오고 있다. 그 액에 스친\n초목은 순식간에 시든다.
2장의 껍질을 여닫아서\n뒤쪽으로 헤엄친다. 어떤 때든\n큰 혀는 항상 내어놓는다.
껍질을 잘 닫아 몸을\n보호하면서 가시를 날려\n상대를 물리치는 전법을 쓴다.
가스에서 태어난 생명체다.\n독을 포함한 가스로 된 몸에\n둘러싸이면 누구든지 기절한다.
어둠을 틈타 가스로 된 손을 뻗쳐\n사람의 어깨를 두드리기 좋아한다.\n그 손에 닿으면 떨림이 멈추지 않는다.
어둠에 떠있는 웃는 얼굴의\n정체는 사람에게 저주를 걸고\n기뻐하는 팬텀이다.
커다란 바위도 집어삼키며\n땅속을 뚫고 나간다.\n그 스피드는 시속 80km다.
튀어나온 코를 실룩샐룩 거리면\n꾸고 있는 꿈을 안다고 한다.\n즐거운 꿈을 매우 좋아한다.
눈앞에서 추를 흔들면\n방금 깨어난 사람도\n3초 후에는 잠들어 버린다.
모래 해변에 구멍을 파서 산다.\n집게는 싸울 때 떨어져 나가도\n다시 자라나 원래대로 돌아온다.
큰 집게의 파워는 1만 마력이다.\n하지만 너무 무거워서\n목표물을 잡는 것이 서투르다.
몬스터볼과 똑 닮았다.\n잘못해서 만지면 감전되거나\n때로는 폭발하므로 위험하다.
전기 에너지를 너무 모아서\n팽팽히 부풀어오른 붐볼이\n바람에 날려오는 경우가 있다.
텔레파시로 대화를 하기 때문에\n아라리를 갈라놓으려 해도\n바로 모여들어 6마리가 된다.
걸어다니는 열대 우림이라고\n불린다. 크게 자란 머리 중 하나가\n땅에 떨어지면 아라리가 된다.
사별한 어머니를 생각하며\n울 때에는 머리에 쓴\n뼈가 달각달각 소리를 낸다.
태어날 때부터 항상 지니고 있는\n뼈를 자유로이 사용한다.\n성격은 난폭하다.
발이 두 배 길이로 늘어난다.\n처음 싸운 상대는\n그 길이에 놀란다.
팔을 비틀며 날리는 펀치는\n콘크리트도 부스러뜨린다.\n3분 싸우면 잠시 쉰다.
2미터나 되는 혀를 내밀면\n꼬리가 흔들리므로 이 둘은\n이어져 있을 가능성이 있다.
공기보다도 가벼운 가스를\n몸에 모아서 떠 있다. 가스는\n냄새나는 데다가 폭발도 한다.
쓰레기에서 발생한 가스를\n먹고 자라게 된다. 극히 드물게\n3개가 이어진 또도가스가 발견된다.
무엇이든 몸통박치기로 부숴버리는\n힘센 장사지만 머리가 나빠서\n사람의 일을 도우는 것은 무리다.
뒷발만으로 서게 되어\n앞발이 자유로워졌기에 지능이\n발달했지만 건망증이 심하다.
상처입은 포켓몬이나 사람이 있으면\n영양 만점의 알을 낳아\n나눠주는 상냥한 포켓몬이다.
전신을 뒤덮은 파란 덩굴에는\n아주 세밀한 털이 나있어\n만지면 매우 간지럽다.
배의 주머니에서 새끼를 키운다.\n안전할 때만 새끼를\n주머니에서 꺼내어 놀게 한다.
산호의 그늘에 거처를 만든다.\n위험을 느끼면 입에서\n새까만 먹물을 내뿜고 도망간다.

아름다운 지느러미를 살랑거리며\n헤엄치는 모습은 매우 화려하지만\n뿔의 공격은 강력하다.
