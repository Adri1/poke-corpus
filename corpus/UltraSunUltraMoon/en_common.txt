You’ve gotta weaken a Pokémon up a bit before you try\nlobbing a Poké Ball at it!
Kukui used a Poké Ball!

Mantine Surf is a sport in which you can execute\nmoves to try to get a high score as you make\nyour way to the island you are trying to reach.\n\nNow let’s start off with four lessons to learn the\nbasics of Mantine Surf!
Lesson 1: Picking up speed\n\nMantine will move forward on its own.\nRide up the face of the wave, and when you\nreach the lip, slide the Circle Pad to the left\nto surf back down and pick up speed!
Once you’re back down in the trough of the\nwave, slide the Circle Pad to the right to climb\nthe face again. Keep riding up and down the\nwave to pick up more and more speed!
Now it’s time for you to give it a try!\nTravel up and down the face of the wave by\nmoving the Circle Pad to the left and right, and\ntry to pick up some speed!
You’ve cleared Lesson 1!\n\nWhen Mantine starts moving really fast, you\nwill see the air currents around it turn orange!
[~ 5]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
Lesson 2: Getting airborne\n\nWhen you reach the highest point of the wave,\nor the lip, slide the Circle Pad to the right and\nyou can launch into the air!
The faster Mantine is traveling, the higher\nyou’ll get off of the wave!
Now give it a try!\nPick up some speed, and then catch some air!
You’ve cleared Lesson 2!\n\nAnd remember: the height of a wave affects\nyour score for some moves, so choose the\nbest wave to leap to the air!
Lesson 3: Aerial moves\n\nWhile you’re in the air, move the Circle Pad in\nany direction to spin and twist.\nYou’ll add more points to your score if you do!
If you can chain together several of these spins\nduring the same aerial, you can pull off a bold\nmove that will earn you a high score!\nThe possible combinations are displayed on the\nlower screen.
It’s your turn now!\nTry to catch some air and pull off some\nawesome moves!
You’ve cleared Lesson 3!\n\nA sparkling ring appears around Mantine at the\nend of a trick. If you start another spin before\nit disappears, you’ll earn an even higher score!
Lesson 4: Landing\n\nWhen in the air, Mantine will slowly lose\nelevation and fall back down toward the\nwater surface.
If Mantine is still spinning when it hits the water,\nit will be swallowed by the wave and sink\nbelow the surface!\nMake sure you time your spins right so that\nthey end before you hit the water!
This is it!\nTry to land safely back on the water after\npulling off an aerial!
You’ve cleared Lesson 4!\n\nIf Mantine lands successfully, you will get a\nlanding bonus added to the points you had\nearned for any aerials you pulled off.\nThis way your score will keep going up!
You’ve cleared all the lessons!\nYou’re a full-fledged Mantine Surfer now!\n\nIf you want to repeat these lessons,\njust ask the Swimmer on the beach!
And one more thing!\nWhen you see an island on the horizon, you’ll\nknow you are close to your destination.\nTry to pull off moves until the very end of your\ntrip, and aim for a really high score!
Now, get out there and become a great\nMantine Surfer!

Nice line of sight!
That’s a good angle!
Think you could get a bit closer?
You’re just slamming that shutter, huh?
It’s super simple, and that’s great!
Just going head-on, huh? ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Where’d you take this?
Nice background, though!
Hey... This is actually cute!
Nice! Real nice!
Let me see its eyes, please!
Is that really what this Pokémon looks like?
Maybe try getting it head-on?
I think it’s pretty good!
A nice profile shot feels fresh!
Looking at it from this angle isn’t bad either.
I guess it’s novel, anyway.
Is that how you take photos?
Side profile, huh? Well, aren’t you cool.
Really? Sideways? ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I can’t see its face...and I’d like to.
Here, lovely! Look over here!
I’ve never seen this one from the back before.
Nice backside.
I don’t know... Do you think this works?
One of my favorite angles.
Are you trying to set me up?
Oooh! Did you stage this?
I’d like to see its face, but this is good, too.
No face?! ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I think it might be too small.
I can’t see much of anything. ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I think I need my bifocals...
Where’s the Pokémon?
I can’t see anything, but I can tell you’re trying!
I dunno what you’re going for, but nice try.
It’d be better if I could see more! ♪
Don’t worry! You’re just getting started!
Try to actually take a good shot next time.
I actually kind of like photos like this.
I’d like to see it better. If only. ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
If you try a bit harder, you should make it.
That’s...a Pokémon, right?
Keep trying! You’ll make it!
So you went this direction, huh?
I can’t really see it, but it might be good!
I don’t really get your aim, but it’s interesting.
You’re no pro, but it’s not THAT bad...
I don’t really get it, but I think it’s fine! ♪
Well, you’re not a pro, right? It’s fine!
Not too shabby!
Maybe if I could see more of it... ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Just a bit bigger next time!
It’s about average, I guess.
I look forward to your next try! ♪
Oooh, so close! A swing and miss!
Looking good!
Good! Needs more Pokémon!
I’d say it has real flavor.
It’s good, but I want to see more Pokémon!
I love the composition!
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Looking good.
Brilliant! You’re really good!
Well, I can see the Pokémon. ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I think it’s really nice! ♪
This one is getting pretty good, huh?
I like it—this kind of angle.
Are you a pro?
It’s a good shot. Like anyone can take.
I like the overall feel of this one.
Try to focus better.
How about focusing next time? ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Isn’t it pretty blurry?
It looks kind of fuzzy to me.
It’s got style, but a bit too blurry.
Are you messing with me?
Out of focus! Try harder!
Try to keep it in focus next time! ♪
I know you can do it! Don’t give up!
If it were in focus, it would’ve been perfect!
That is so COOL!
Awesome! I love it!
That is one cool shot.
That’s a smashing photo!
I wish you’d photo me like that...
You must be a famous photographer!
I knew it! You really are a pro!
Maybe I should catch one of those...
You’re cool. I’ll give you that! ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Where’d you take this one, huh?
Super cute! (#^-^#)
That’s a cute shot! :)
Very cute! Thumbs-up! ♪
I can’t get enough of this form!
My grandkids are cuter than that!
Kawaii! ^^
Whoa! Cuteness overload!
I gotta give it up to you this time. ¯\\_(^-^)_/¯
My eyes! They can’t take the cuteness!
Awww, it’s so cuuuuuute! ♪
It probably has a high IQ, huh?
Very distinguished looking...
Nice! I want one!
I already have one. ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Is it Psychic type?
I bet it’s good at calculating things! ♪
I’d never seen this one before! ＼(・ｏ・)／
Doesn’t it have good Sp. Atk? IIRC.
I’m trying to catch one of these myself!
I like this kind of Pokémon.
Look at those muscles!
I’d take one. ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
What a body...
I’m raising one of these on my team!
I don’t know. Not my type.
That body is no joke!
That’s a sturdy-looking Pokémon all right...
My boyfriend has one of those!
My Machoke’s tougher than that.
Nice muscles! ♪
So beautiful! ♪
Beautiful, eh? ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I want one...
I haven’t ever found one of these beauts!
Sometimes you get lucky with a good subject.
I like this photo!
That Pokémon is positively glowing!
Ugh. What are you trying to do to my eyes?
Don’t mind me as I wipe away the drool...
Beauty is justice! ♪
So close! Isn’t it missing a little something?
I’d love to see more of it.
I think you missed a bit there. Keep trying!
Think about your framing, pal.
Let me guess: You’re good at selfies?
Looks pretty steady!
Maybe try not cutting it off? ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Didn’t cut off too much this time!
Ooooh, so close! （＞_＜）
The composition isn’t too bad.
You cut it off! Try harder!
Close, but you’ve cut a bit off there.
You missed quite a lot there. So close!
You cut it off so bad that maybe it’s good...
You cut off a lot, but I like it.
That’s really a lot cut off. Try again!
You cut it off, but it was a good try!
Too cut off. Keep trying! ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Try to actually aim at the Pokémon. ♪
Shoot the whole Pokémon next time.
What were you even aiming at? ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I do the same thing all the time!
I’m sorry, but I don’t get it.
Try to follow it as it moves!
Hold your camera carefully!
Well, that’s gutsy! It’s all cut off!
I think you may have cut off too much.
Keep trying, aspiring photographer!
You missed the mark. Try again!
Too cut off! （＞ｏ＜） Keep trying!
Good on you! Getting such an early start.
Good morning! ♪
Too sleepy... (´ー｀)

You’re full of pep this afternoon!
It’s already night over here.
Guten Morgen!
¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás?
There’s a lovely sunset.
I must confess that I am weary at this hour.
It’s the magic hour!
Is this what they called the golden hour?
Hmm, I’d like to linger here a little longer... ♪
Is it that time already?! I’d better make dinner!
This is the best time of day.
Now! Take as many shots as you can now!
I want to sleep... (´ー｀)
Wow... It’s already evening?

Oh! Nighttime photography, huh?
Nice shot! d(>_< )
I’d sure like to go to Alola...
Nice. I just want to pet it!
It’s a decent photo.
Try harder. ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Even I could take a shot like that.
I guess it’s good enough for an amateur.
I’d give it a B-.
I like it.
I hope you can become a real photographer!

I like the atmosphere.
Not bad. ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯

Reminds me of myself when I was young.
Must be a strong one.
I’d like to put that one on a poster!

No fair. That is just too darn cute!
So cunning! But so cute!

Anyway, thank you!
You all set?
See ya! Don’t worry about it!
E-e-e-easy. Let’s take it easy.\nCan’t help it if we get flustered.
Did you...maybe take it a little too easy?
Maybe I took it too easy...
If you’re with me, let’s take it easy. E-e-e-easy.
To be honest, maybe you take it easier\nthan I do.
Hey! That’s pretty cold!\nI told you to call me if there’s gonna be a battle!
Hey, what’s your deal? That’s it?
Hey, you’re a lot of fun!\nYou gotta call me next time, too!
Thanks for picking me! Let’s go all out!
Wha-a-at, that’s it? Call me again sometime!
My precious Pokémon! No way am I gonna lose!
See? Just like I thought! ’Cause I never lose!
Th-that was— Is this for real?
My precious Pokémon! Don’t you dare let them\nget hurt!
Heeey! My Pokémon got hurt!
I-I’m full o’ courage! I-I’mma do my best!
Yay-yay! I did my best! Mama!
Even though I did my best... Mama...help me...
Huh? Yer not my mama...

Here you are! The Masked Man!\nI’ll take you on!
Whoo! Justice! Justice usually wins!
*sniffle* The hero isn’t s’posed to lose...
The hero of justice has arrived!\nYou can leave it to me!
Doesn’t justice usually involve winning?
I still don’t have my own Pokémon.\nI borrowed my big brother’s Pokémon.
Ah... I won... I knew my big brother was great!
What do I do? My big brother’s Pokémon are...
I’ll give it my best shot with my\nbig brother’s Pokémon!
My big brother’s Pokémon are...\nI wonder if he’ll be mad at me...
Y’see me, thing is, I got no idea, y’know,\nwhy I’m here.
Just now, y’know, I got no idea, umm, what happened.
So yeah, I kinda, right now, got no idea what I’m doing.
So uhh, I got no idea, umm, why I was called.
So yeah, I, uhh, got no idea why, y’know, I gotta \ngo home.
The magic girl is here! I’m gonna discipline you!
Hee-hee! I’ll turn you into a Pokémon with my magic!
Waah! My magic isn’t working!\nThere’s something weird about you!
The magic girl is here!\nYou want me to discipline everyone, right?
Ahh! My magic ran out!\nI’ve gotta make a sacrifice!
I dunno difficult stuff! But I’ll do my best!
I dunno difficult stuff! But I won!
I dunno difficult stuff! Izzat why I lost?
I dunno difficult stuff! But I’ll do my best!
I dunno difficult stuff! Must be why I lose!
Maybe you really think you c’n beat me?
Never in a million years, right? Ohoho! Ohohohoho!
What a cocky kid! I’mma tell my daddy on you!
Oh I got this! You can just sit back and watch!
It’s ’cause you didn’t go all out! Get it together!
I’ll try rully rully hard! You try hard, too!
I tried hard! You, too—keep trying, keep trying!
I tried rully hard! That’s all I got! That’s it!
I’ll try hard! That’s it!
I tried rully hard! You tried hard, too!
I’m OK with something casual right now!\nI want to experience romance again!
But I just came here thinking that\na nice, strong guy would be enough...
Love and travel are similar, aren’t they?\nAt a certain point, each must end.
I’m looking for a nice guy!\nYou’ve gotta help me out!
I didn’t find any nice guys...\nI’ll get my revenge next time...
Augh... My tummy is in pain...\nTo the extreme... Auugh...
Oooh... My stomach’s about to turn into a volcano...
Food and water poisoning are the true charm of travel,\naren’t they...
Augh... My tummy is in pain...\nThat’s a sign that I’m in good form...
My tummy pain is gone...\nMaybe that’s why we lost...
There was a bunch of stuff going on,\nand I ran away to this place.
Keep my secret, OK? I’ll never forgive you if you tell anyone.
It’s about time for me to change my face again.
Let’s do this quickly ’cause I don’t wanna\nstand out too much!
Come on, let’s leave quickly or someone\nwill see us...
Ugh...\nAfter all, in this region, too...
Huh...\nI’m so bored I can’t stand it...
Wherever I do stuff with Pokémon, there’s no real change\nfor the better...
I am pretty bored, so shall we do this together?
I actually wasn’t that bored! You’re pretty good!
I crossed a steep mountain range in coming\nhere from afar.
My Pokémon got toughened up through climbing.
The way of battle is like a mountain in that they’re\nboth steep climbs.
You calling me must mean that there’s a high\nmountain to climb.
We have to descend at one of the last stations,\nbefore reaching the top.
The tough guy of all tough guys!\nThat’s my nickname!
You wanna know why I’m strong? Because I’m a tough guy!
The tough-guy nickname...I guess you took it from me...
You called the tough guy! Sure! Leave it to me!
There’s nothing to worry about...\nYou were tough, too...
Yeah, boss! Is it time for battering practice?
Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Thanks for this, boss!
Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Thanks for that, boss!
Yeah, boss! I won’t be pushed out of the ring!
Yeah! Thanks for that!\nLet’s train again sometime!
I hate being fussy!\nI guess the brute-force approach really is best!
Battle is about pummeling and pummeling!\nScram if you’re weak!
Good, good! You’ve got a lot of physical strength!
OK, let’s hurry up and do it!\nLet’s power through this!
It’s unavoidable... The weak just fade away...
No, no, I’m not playing hooky!\nIt’s just a long lunch break!
I lose track of time when I’m here.
Ah, well... Guess I better be getting back...
My lunch break isn’t over, so keep me\ncompany for a bit.
OK, guess I better get back to work...
Hey! Hey, chief! Are you listening to me?!
Hey, what’s this, chief?! It’s too early for you to give out!
Good stuff, chief! Let’s go to another place!
Ah, that’s the chief all right!\nWe going to the next place?!
Sorry, chief! That’s it for me!
During work I’ve been sparing no effort to\nsteadily train!
The coexistence of work and Pokémon! That’s my dream!
The coexistence of work and Pokémon...\nThat must be a dream...
I finished up work early today!
Huh, it’s over already?\nBut I finished up early for this!
This is my first year as a working adult!\nIt’s my first year as a Trainer, too!
Huh, I guess you’re still a newcomer, too!
Seems like I’ve got a ton of stuff I’ve still got to learn...
I may still be a newcomer, but I’ll give it\neverything I have!
We’re both still newcomers, so there’s still\na lot ahead of us!
After five, it’s Pokémon battle!\nThat’s a smart woman’s etiquette!
Being strong in battle puts you on the fast track\nto promotion!
You won’t even play the good host to me?!\nThere’s no way you’re getting promoted!
Leave it to the smart woman!\nI’ll get you promoted, too!
You’ve gotten this far thanks to me!
This kind of battle is really just a break...
See? That was just play... It was totally useless...
That was slightly entertaining... Only slightly...
This is a break... It’s really just a break...
Well, it was only slightly so, but I guess that\nwas fun.
O-oh! Oh, oh! Y-you wanna tangle with me?
Heh... Heh, heh, heh... I did it... Me...
Oh! Don’t you come here again! No! Don’t come back!
O-oh! It’s been a while, huh? Leave this to me!
I-I did what I could! Don’t look at me like that!
Hunh?! What’s yer problem? You lookin’ at me?
I won’t go easy on ya just ’cause yer a whippersnapper!
When two sets of eyes meet, ya gitcha a one-on-one battle!\n’S what it is t’be a Trainer!
Yep! Leave it t’me!\nI’ll right near shoot the works!
I’m real sorry...\nI’m confident in my one-on-one battling but...
This is me... So I’ll get at it...
Hee-hee... With this, I, too...
Urgh... But why...
This is me... So I’ll get at it...
But it’s not my fault...
Huh? You think I’m a bad dude?\nNah, this is just fashion.
When it comes to Pokémon, too, Dark type is still the coolest.
Being a little bad is best ’cause you can be direct\nand popular.
Being a little bad makes you popular!\nThat’s my style!
If we had lost in a bit of a cooler way,\nwe would’ve been all set.
I’ve turned this bad because I wanted to be\ncalled a pixie.
Aren’t girls who twist guys and Pokémon\naround their finger the worst?
If your face and style are dull, you need other charms.
Oh, it’s been a while.\nBut I’m glad you called on me.
Of course I’m disappointed, but I tried my\nbest, really.
Gimme your Pokémon! Yeah, gimme right now!
You lost, so gimme! Gimme yer Pokémon!
Other people’s Pokémon are super appealing...
Aha! You’re gonna gimme yer Pokémon?\nNo? You wanna battle together?
Next time, you definitely gotta gimme\nyer Pokémon!
Hey, let’s get it going! ’Cause there’s no escape!
Not yet! Not by a long shot! Get up and come at me!
Nice! I’ve got a thing for you! You’re something else!
All right! Let’s go! Get psyched up!
Rather than feeling down after losing,\nyou gotta think about the next time! Right?
Hey-hey, here we go, right? You and me, yeah!
What! What, what! No way—it’s over already?!
No way... Whoa... That was way more than I thought...
Hey, here we go right now, yeah?\nYou and me, yeah!
It’s over already... Seems super early, right?
All right, here I go! I’mma knock it outta \nthe park!
There it goes! A big, big-tiiiiime home run!
...Ahhh. Guess I’m out.
You and me as the battery!\nWe’ll show the whole world!
Eh, some days you don’t have it and\nyou strike out.
...My bat is crying because it wants a hit\nso badly.
Oh boy, I got another boring hit...
Ack... A grounder... I don’t usually hit ground balls...
Perhaps you’d like to swap jerseys with me...
Three outs and time to change sides... A fielder\nuses a toothpick even when he hasn’t eaten...
When it comes to batting, you’ve gotta swing\nto get a hit.
See, you’ve gotta start by doing your daily practice swings.
In life, too, if you don’t swing, you won’t hit anything at all.
Oh, you’re fired up!\nOK, OK, let’s get it cranked up!
I swung with everything I had, so it’s OK\nwith me, even though I didn’t hit anything.
Get into my stance, then hit...\nGet into my stance, then hit...
I hit it... I got a hit...
Another swing and a miss...
Get into my stance, then hold my bat high...\nGet into my stance, then hold my bat high...
I ended up swinging and missing...
And now, for the final game! No way I’ll lose!
If you always feel your back’s against the wall\nwhen you battle, you’ll get results.
A sense of pressure is important for battling.
If you wanna form a duo with me, then we’re\naiming for the top!
It didn’t work out...\nThere wasn’t enough pressure...
All right!
Ooh! Yes!
Dang!
All right!
Dang!
Wa-hah-hah! Kneel before my Pokémon!
Whoa, you didn’t have to actually kneel! I just said that\nbecause I got excited.
Heh-heh! There you go! Well, I underrated you!
Wa-hah-hah! I can’t exactly pop right out when\ncalled, so I walked here.
Even though I did what I could, this is the result.\nEh, sometimes there are days like this.
Whoa! You’re my opponent! I’m a little stoked!
Oh! You OK? You’re barely breathing!
Oh! Your Pokémon are samurai! They’re super dangerous!
Whoa! You’re my partner! I’m really stoked!
There shouldn’t be any mistakes between you\nand me...
It’s summer all year round in Alola, so let’s\nenjoy a blazing battle!
Whew, I worked up a sweat!\nTime to head to the ocean for a dip!
Good-bye, summer!
You called me for a blazing battle, right?
You worked up a sweat, too!\nC’mon, let’s head to the ocean!
Whether it’s fun or not is up to your Pokémon.
Well, it’s happy and fun times to win, but I feel bad for\nyour Pokémon.
I lost, but that was fun! You and your Pokémon are fantastic!
Whether it’s fun or not is up to the two of us.
I lost, but it was fun because we\nwere together. ♪
Ahh... I feel sluggish in this heat...\nLet’s get this started...
Ahh... Sluggish... I feel super sluggish from winning...
Ahh... Hot... I feel super hot from losing...
Aah... Hot...and...sluggish...
Sluggish... I feel sluggish just from talking...
If I win this battle, I’ll fess up to the person\nI like!
Ack, I won! Really? Oh no! What do I do?!
Don’t get in the way of someone’s romance!
I don’t have the guts to fess up to the person\nI like, so I take refuge in battle.
When I lose in battle it feels like I’m about\nto get dumped.
Howdy! Are you a local?\nDo you understand what I’m saying?
Well! What an honor! You showed me such hospitality!
Coming at me out of the blue...\nThis is why it’s scary to go overseas...
Howdy! Are you a local?\nWhere do you feel like taking me?
First you force me out here, and then\nI get my butt kicked. This place is awful.
This is my first time coming to a place\nlike this, so please go easy on me.
Ha... How refreshing... Can we keep going?
H-hey! What’s up with this?! Are you ripping me off?!
I don’t have a lot of tag-team experience,\nso please go easy on me.
Whew... How refreshing... I did pretty well, right?
We came here specially on our honeymoon,\nbut my bride ran off somewhere...
In this situation... Ah, what do I do...?
She’s so fickle that I’m feeling uneasy... Aah...
My bride ran off somewhere.\nYou gotta help me out!
The battle may have ended, but where’d my\nbride run off to...?
I did so much shopping that I’m totally broke...
I won the battle, so give me some spending money!
On top of that, I lost the battle... I’m stone broke...
I’ll help you out in the battle, so can you\nloan me some cash?
See how cool I was? So, loan me some cash!
When you’re on a trip, lose your inhibitions.\nLose ’em, lose ’em all. ♪
This is a vacation! It’s all about having fun! ♪
But I don’t want to be disgraced like this!
An opponent I met in passing as my partner!\nThis is another part of the appeal of vacations!
Wow! You’re the best. ♪\nI got an unforgettable memory. ♪
Uhh... What is this place?\nDoesn’t smell like vacation!
No way, no way! This isn’t my idea of vacation!
I’ve gotta get outta here now! My vacation will be over!
What’s your deal...?\nYou gonna give me a vacation?
Totally and completely nope!\nThis isn’t my idea of vacation!
Hey, hey. I’ll shine your Pokémon up good!
I did a good job! So clean, you could lick ’em!
Hey! Why you running off?!\nI still haven’t done the waxing!
You and me, we’ll shine up the\nopponent’s Pokémon!
Can’t handle this one...\nI couldn’t do any polishing at all...
Cleaning is just like training! I’m all muscle!
Cleaning makes for good training. Old movies will tell ya that.
How fierce is the cleaning that you do?!
Here you are, you youngster! You’re here\nto apply yourself to training with me!
You’re pretty good!\nI can sense your growth!
My old lady laid down an ultimatum.\nShe said it was either her or my mop!
My old lady’s my old lady.\nMy mop is my mop.
My mop is way cuter than my nagging old lady.
Usually my mop or my old lady is my partner,\nbut I guess this time it’s you.
Anyway, you’re a lot better than my old lady.
Oh yeah, it’s great to skip out on work\nfor a battle.
Whatever you’re doing, it’s great to\nhide out and do it secretly.
If my boss finds out about this, first I’ll be fired,\nthen the wife will divorce me.
I skipped out on work for this again.\nDon’t tell anyone.
Oh man! Oh man, listen! My boss just saw me!
Pokémon are our partners on the site!\nOur ties are deep!
We’re always together on the site.\nIt’s a different sort of combination.
Even tough work is a cinch if you have Pokémon.
We who have toughened up on the\nsite will lend you our strength!
OK, that’s it for us this time!\nCall us again, partner!
It bothers me that young people these\ndays are totally lacking in perseverance.
So you’re another member of today’s youth.\nWhat’s it going to be like when I’m an old guy...
I heard the same thing when I was\nyoung, and it was pretty irritating.
Oh, a member of today’s youth...\nI ask you to be steady...
Because the kids these days...\nMe, too, I guess...
Nope! No way in the world am I just\ngonna idly slip into senility!
Nope! Nope! Nope! I still wanna be in my prime!
Not like this... No way I wanna get closer to dying...
Nope! No way I’m joining you!\nAnd anyway, I’ll hold you back!
Not like this... I hate good-byes...
Elders should be respected. You get that, right?
Be guided by children when you’re old? What hogwash!
...You’ve made enemies of the older generation around\nthe nation.
You as my partner? In that case,\nyou get it, right? Right?
Making an old guy work too hard...\nYou’re something else...
My grandkids are cheering me on.\nNo way I’ll lose.
Pappy won! I won!
Sorry... Your pappy lost...
With the cheers of my grandkids in my heart,\nthis pappy is aflutter!
No... Please don’t look at me...\nDon’t look at your pappy...
I used to be a Trainer who\nwas feared as a witch.
It’s impolite to call me a witch, since I’m so nice.
Gghh... This is unforgivable...\nI’m definitely gonna put a curse on you...
So you’re gonna leave it to me,\nI who was called a witch?
Gnhh... This grudge...\nI won’t forget it for as long as I live...
I used to be called a diamond in the rough,\nalthough that was decades ago.
I’m still a diamond in the rough! I’ll keep growing!
I aged while still in the rough, and now my diamond\nis tarnished.
The diamond in the rough is here!\nWell! The time for growth!
I guess, since I remained a diamond in the rough,\nit was my fate to be shattered into pieces.
Before I die, allow me to go all out\nin a Pokémon battle once again!
Aah... The thrill of rushing about...\nI don’t want to die for a long while yet!
Losing reignited my fire! The ending is still a long way off!
Before I die, I’d been wanting to form a duo\nwith someone once again.
I’m burning from my loss!\nRejuvenation complete!
Just fighting, even if I’m reduced to ash.\nIn short, that’s my path.
Winning or losing is worthless. I find meaning in how I fought.
Being reduced to ash, yet still fighting\nas ash, is the way of the Trainer.
Our way of life is, namely, our way of death.\nYou will pay keen attention to this on our side.
This is it: our life is our path, just\nmoving forward without any regrets.
Well! Here I come!
Pretty good skills... You should apply yourself...
The underdog has no mouth with which to speak...
Well! Here we come!
The losers simply fade away...
Aim for a hole in one!\nRoar, my driver!
Hnnn! An albatross!
Looks like I got a triple bogey...
Here’s my caddy! Get my driver!
Hey, caddy...I was a long way from the green...
Well, I couldn’t make it as a professional, so I’m\na lesson pro.
They’re not golf lessons. I’m giving Pokémon lessons.
You show promise. You could probably make it as a pro.
I’m working as a lesson pro, so I’m good at\nworking with others.
You’re good at working with others. You could\nprobably make it as a pro.
I started so I could welcome guests, but I got\ntotally hooked.
Unfortunately it costs a lot of money to play golf.
Don’t get the wrong idea—that was just my welcoming play.
I won’t say we have to welcome them.\nDon’t hold me back.
You’ll never succeed if you don’t become\nmore considerate.
I started just to keep my daddy company, but at\nsome point I became obsessed.
You have pretty good taste! Wanna go out with me?
I guess as your social relationships broaden, so do your\nhobbies. Heh.
My daddy’s not here today!\nSo let’s go together. ♪
Young kids really are different! Even if we lose,\nwe are still cheerful. ♪
You gotta shout when you swing!\nLike this: “Wonton noodles!”
Tempo is important for both golf and Pokémon!
Ph-phew!
Shout when you swing!\nLike this: “Wonton noodles!”
Argh! We lost because the timing of our\nshouting was off.
You’re my new caddy? You sure you’re cut out\nfor that?
Hey! You’re already done? What a wussy caddy!
Just as I’d expect from my caddy! I was right to hire\nyou on. ♪
OK! Let’s play a round! Let’s get fired up!
It wasn’t your fault, caddy. I wasn’t on\nmy game...
The Pokémon I raised will be tough for you to\ndeal with! You betcha!
I raised them with care! You betcha! Yeah, so they can’t be\nbeat! You betcha!
No way this could happen! You betcha! I messed up!\nYou betcha!
You and I will fight together to the bitter end!\nYou betcha!
I gave it everything I had! You betcha! I’ve got\nno regrets! You betcha!
I’ve raised a bunch of Pokémon, but I haven’t\nfound “the one.”
Raising Pokémon is, like, actually really difficult.
Seems like you’ve raised your Pokémon up really well.
These guys aren’t too impressive, but I leave\none to you.
It’s hard for me to say, but our result wasn’t\ntoo impressive...
Ohh... You look robust... Let this old-timer\ntrain you!
See, I’ve gotta train you! All right! C’mon over here!
Hold it! Don’t run away! Leave it to this old-timer!
All right! Let’s get going! Everyone’s gonna train\nwith this old-timer!
I got to do a lot of training, so I’m satisfied.\nLet’s all go training again sometime!
Please... Don’t tease the Pokémon I raised...
What do you think...? My Pokémon... Really cute, right...?
You’re awful. Awful... Please don’t harm others...
Please be considerate around the Pokémon\nI raised...
Why won’t you protect me...?
Caring for Pokémon from morning until night! It’s\ntough being a Breeder!
I wonder if there isn’t someone somewhere who will care\nfor me.
Just liking it isn’t enough to keep you going. In this job, you\ntake on life itself.
Oh! Are you gonna care for me?
Hey now! You just throw me away if we lose?!\nDoesn’t that seem just awful to you?!
I built up these muscles through work! You\nwanna check and see if it’s all for show?
*flex flex*
But using my muscles is what I do...
I built up these muscles through work! Just sit\nback and watch my team!

I’m here studying as part of my training as a\nnew employee.
I’m learning how to win a battle without harming\nthe customer.
I’m learning how to lose a battle without getting annoyed.
This is duo training as part of my training as a\nnew employee.
I learned a lot. Thank you very much.
Huh? You want good service? Then aren’t you\nforgetting something?
Y’see, if you provide your service and sincerity for free,\nothers will take advantage of you.
Hey, hey, what about the tip! The tip! My livelihood depends\non that!
This time we’ll be partners, so you can relax\n’cause I don’t need a tip.
You’re really dedicated, aren’t you? You seem\ncut out for the service industry.
I got hooked on Pokémon battles to the\npoint that I lost everything.
Just like me, my friends also strayed from the path here.
Just having something I can get so into that I go a little nuts\nmakes me happy.
I spend more time here than I do at home.
I see you around pretty often, too... Pretty soon \nthere will be no turning back for us.
Excellently raised Pokémon are my specialty.
Raising them with the best food makes them the strongest.
You’re no gourmand, are you? I can’t do anything for those\nwith no taste buds.
I’m ready to cook up another challenge!
No... For us to have been eaten up with\nsuch relish...
You’re young so eat up. Yeah, don’t be shy!
I bet you could still eat! When you’re young, even if your\nstomach is bursting, you should just eat!
No need to chew! ’Cause food is really just a drink!
Hey! You’re younger than me, so it’s up to you\nto really chow down!
Whoops, I messed up. Next time I’ll give you so\nmuch food, you’ll be bursting.
I’m the cooking wizard! Time for me to get you\nprepped!
Nu-ha-ha-ha! All right! I’ll salt and pepper you up!
Nu-ha-ha-ha! I didn’t have all the ingredients I needed,\nso farewell!
It’s the advent of the cooking wizard! OK!\nI’ll whip up some BBQ!
Nu-ha-ha-ha! I’m tuckered out! All right!\nI’ll fix up a meal!
I’m a dude who’s always burning! Here I go!\nComplete combustion!
You’ve gotta burn, too! Burn, baby! This is no time\nfor smoldering!
You think it’s too hot?! Don’t tell the truth!

You still think it’s too hot?! But I said it’s not\ncool to tell the truth!
Th-this line of work causes your family to worry\nabout you.
With this kind of dangerous job, having a steady relationship\nis kinda... Haha...
Well, I guess you could say that fire is my sweetheart right\nnow? Kinda? Ha, haha.
The job is the job, so I’m pretty used to teaming\nup with others.
It’s my fault for imagining what it would be like if\nyou were that girl I admire...
What’s your deal? You’d be OK with me\narresting you? That’d be OK, right? You’d be\r\nOK with that?
O-K! Arrested! This is the moment when I snap on the\nhandcuffs! Awe...some!
Hold on! Lemme arrest you! Even if it’s just a mistaken arrest!
Oh! It’s you! Let’s go make an arrest! Doesn’t\nmatter who it is. Let’s make an arrest!
The suspect who fled was huge, right? Let’s go\nmake another arrest sometime!
Since my grandfather’s generation, we’ve been\nPolicemen, but there aren’t any particular career\r\nopportunities in the field.
We begin as Policemen, and then it ends.
There are some Pokémon that can’t evolve. Their lives are\nalready determined when they come into the world.
Someone is curious about teaming up with a\nPoliceman. That person has\r\nweighty expectations.
Here, the journey ends.
Part of a justice squad! A Policeman has come!
No one can stand up to a Policeman! Penalty administered!
It’s a shame, but this Policeman must stop at this point.
A Policeman! Has come! Let’s go together!\nPolice kid!
Sorry! Police kid! It’s a shame, but I must stop\nat this point.
I’m a mad scientist! Modification is my hobby!
I’ll make you really strong! So it’s OK for me to modify\nyou, right?
You guys are really strong! Have you been modified?
I’m a mad scientist! Should we do\nmodification together?
You were unusually strong! You haven’t been\nmodified, right?!
I may not look it, but I’m an outdoors type and\nsurfing is my pastime.
I’m usually doing lab work, aren’t I? See, I just want to get\nsome sunlight.
If you don’t take in the sea breeze and the like, don’t you\nstart to get a little down?
Hey there! Sure. Leave it to me!\nI’m pretty confident!
OK then. Good work! I’ve gotta get on to the\nnext thing!
According to my data, in this match...I’ve got a\n98 percent chance of victory.
Data never lies... People, on the other hand...
M-my calculations were off?!
According to my data, with this duo...we’ve got\na 99 percent chance of victory.
Probabilities are probabilities... Just like\nunsteady people...
I’m jealous... You’re still a kid... I wish I could go\nback to that time...
I’ve become a corrupt adult, so I’m underhanded in\nbattles, too.
Where has that pure version of me from those days gone?
Let me get back that pure and innocent\nversion of me from those days!
There’s no hope for me.\nI’m already a tarnished adult...
I’ve trained 10 years for this day!
Nuhaha! The fruits of my training!
I’ve trained 10 years for this day...but I completely forgot\nto train my Pokémon.
I’ve trained 10 years for this encounter!
I trained day in, day out, and I completely forgot\nabout being social.
The wishes contained in my fist! I’ll convert\nthem to power and let them flow now!
As a Trainer, my skill is the only part of me that talks.
My spirit...didn’t quite measure up...
The fighting spirit that wells up in our breast!\nLet’s make use of it as we get this going!
I didn’t have the capability... Sorry...friend...
There are those who dance and those who\nwatch. Which describes your life, I wonder?
Anyway, when it comes to this transient life, I’m gonna\nbe dancing.
Is there meaning to being born to a life of just watching and\nempty words, I wonder?
Life is transient. Let’s bloom without\nfear of falling.
Thanks for the fun moment. If we’re alive\ntogether, let’s do this again.
Yeah, this is cosplay. I just wanted to be\nsomeone different.
I can look however I want to look. It’s not\nbothering anyone.
I spoke of being a different person, but I guess the regular\nme is here...

I served as the opponent for you. You don’t have any token \nof gratitude for me?
I-I was the opponent, you know! You can’t at least lose\nfor me?
I’ll join in a duo! No way we’ll lose, right?
I joined in the duo! I can’t believe this result!
I’ll defeat you, get a bunch of money, and\nbecome huge, so please allow this to happen.
It’s OK. Not everyone can be like me—someone who would \nput their life on the line for Pokémon.
I’m already shabbadabba—the show’s over for me. But I can’t\ndislike a person like you.
I’m here. You’re here. We’ve got some leeway.
I’m already shabbadabba—the show’s over for \nme. But I can’t dislike a fight alongside you.
If you win, I’ll tell you my most treasured secret...
That’s really too bad, isn’t it? My secret will remain a secret.
My secret... It’s in my name...
It’s a secret even to my partner, the mystery\nI hide.
That was close... I’ll head home, bearing\nmy secret.
Whoa! You seem super strong! With all this\nexcitement, let’s go!
Whoa! That was seriously intense! I’m shaking from\nthe adrenaline!
Whoa! That was seriously scary! My pulse is pounding!
Whoa! Haven’t seen you for a while! With all this\nexcitement, let’s go!
Whoa! I’m seriously out! I might pass out!
All right, let’s do this.
Yeah, good work.
Yep, you’re strong.
All right, let’s go.
OK, see ya.
Relax and leave it to me. I’ve got\nsome experience.
You learned something, right? Experience is important\nafter all!
My Pokémon and I were no match for you. You and your\nPokémon are more than you seem to be.
Leave it to me! I’ll show you something great!
I learned a lot! I won’t give up and I’ll\nkeep fighting!
There are two types of strength... The hard-\nworking type and the talented type.
Even if you work hard, you’re no match for my talent!
You’ve got talent and you work hard?!
You, the hardworking type, should just support\nme, the talented type.
Were we lacking in talent? Hard work? Or both?
Now I’m a scientist, but I used to be a doctor.
You must be willing to use moves if you want to understand\ntheir power.
As you might expect from someone who was a doctor,\nI’m not very good at hurting Pokémon.
Even if we lose, I’ll fix you up. I’m only partway\nthrough my research, though.
Good work, I’ll fix you up. I’ve got absolutely\nzero confidence that I can though.
If I had encountered Pokémon at an earlier point,\nmy life might’ve been much different.
While dealing almost wholly with machines, my heart froze up.
I’m tired of computers. I want a living companion.
If I had encountered you at an earlier point,\nmy life might’ve been much different.
Living companions are pretty great, aren’t they?
I love karate! Do you like karate?
I like Pokémon battles, too! But I like karate more!
I like karate! But I don’t like you!
I love karate! I’ll go at it with karate!
Oh... Didn’t do enough training...\nI’m gonna go do karate...
Mm!
Hm!
Nn!
Mm!
Rrr!
My hands are cramped and my feet are\nblistered, but still, I must dance.
I’ve got to work on my dancing skills to be the\nbest dancer.
Standing in front of people is a really daunting thing.
I can’t do too much, but I’ll at least cheer you on\nwith dance.
Was my dancing not good? I’ll dance well\nnext time.
If they watch me dancing, even Pokémon get\nreally excited!
Uh uh! Come on now! You can go a lot further!
You’re really pumped up, too! All right!\nAll-night dancing!
Let’s get pumped up and get at it!\nFollow my lead!
That wasn’t enough for me! Promise that you’ll\ncall me again!
Even I, an ordinary Collector, was able to join\nthe aces!
Heh... It’s tough, isn’t it...the ace title...
Alas! For me to be in this predicament, I bring dishonor to\nthe aces!
Leave it to me, Ace Trainer that I am!
Heh... We’re cowardly...you and I...
I shall break in this unknown junior Trainer.
Heh, heh... Maybe I’ll give you a candy after that whipping.
Hey there, that’s it, junior Trainer! Perhaps you want to\nbreak me in?
Unknown junior Trainer, I’ll form a tandem\nwith you!
The party ends here this time. Let’s get\ntogether again, junior Trainer!
Hunh... You... Somewhere, I’ve...
Huh... Who was that...?
I can’t remember... Even though I should know it...
Hunh... You again... Let’s see, you must be...
It’s no good... I can’t remember... Now, who were\nyou again...?
I must not forget my initial resolution! I’ll always\nhave that newcomer feeling!
Thanks! I’m grateful to you! I learned a lot!
Thanks! I’m grateful to you! Please treat me to\nsomething, mentor!
I must not forget my initial resolution! I’ll work on\nstaying fresh!
Thanks! Nice work! OK, that’s it for me!
Let’s not beat around the bush! I’m your\nopponent! Bring it on!
A Trainer who can’t win is worthless!\nLeave the ring...immediately!
Mercy is mockery of one’s opponent! Come on! Finish it!
Our mission is simple! Completely rout them all!
We didn’t achieve our goal! We’re disqualified as\nTrainers!
They’re my cherished friends, but don’t take it\neasy on them.
You were unlucky. With Pokémon, too, you have to wonder\nwhat they were born to do.
Making their friends fight is the calling of Trainers.
We must be prepared if we’re going to send our\ncherished friends into the ring.
Whether we win or lose, our Pokémon still get\nhurt. It makes you think, right?
You believe in them more than anything else...\nyour Pokémon...
You started to doubt your belief, didn’t you...\nThat’s why you lost.
Believing is good, isn’t it?
I believe...in you and your Pokémon...
Since this is the result of my believing in y’all, I\nhave no complaints about being in this state.
Here’s my scream! Oowhoaaaaa!
Here’s my scream! Yeah-gooooooood!
Here’s my scream! Guwhoaaaa!
Here’s my scream! Oowhoaaaaa!
It’s all over! Allllll riiiiiight!
I’m always able to mutter these feelings only\nafter I say good-bye.
This violent throbbing in my chest...\nyou must not be aware of it...
Bye-bye. Don’t look back... That back... I’ll never forget it.
Our meeting signals our parting. But we must\npress on.
This ceaseless, stirring refrain... I’ll still keep it\nto myself.
Oh, I get it, all right. You’re here for action, \nright? Fire it up! I’m so fired up!
I just barely won, but...this kid is something special...
Hey, what’s the story with you guys...?\nYour Pokémon are absolute monsters...
Oho! It’s you! This one’s fired up!
This kid’s definitely got a bright future! The\nfuture’s really something to look forward to!
With Pokémon I have long been living... With only\nPokémon I have long been living...
With only Pokémon I’ve been living, so that I’m strong\nis a given...
With only Pokémon I am living... My remaining years\nseem unforgiving...
With only Pokémon I am living...so human\ncompanionship I am missing...
This losing feeling sure is gloomy... I wanna go\nhome and get some snoozies...
I will not take you lightly. You better really\nbe ready.
Come now, can you even stand up? Your spirit and body\nhave been...
You are really impressive, Trainer... To have that kind of\nability is priceless...
The time has some for us to flaunt our abilities.
I am dissatisfied with the result, but we can\ndiscuss that some other time.
OK, my beloved Pokémon! Put the squeeze\non them!
That’s it, my Pokémon! The opponent is no longer at ease!
*squeeze*
OK, let’s put the squeeze on everyone!
*squeeze*
Being together, my Pokémon and I have no\nblind spots.
Really, you seem totally naive. What if you started over as\na baby?
It’s a fuzzy decision, but a loss... You absolutely reap what\nyou sow...
You and I as a pair...this will be an intense\ndevelopment.
What a sentimental battlefield... I’ll probably\npass out as soon as I get home.
I guess I’ll give it everything I’ve got so I have\nno regrets...
Hey, hey? You don’t have any regrets? Right? You’ve got no\nregrets, right?
I said I’d give it everything I had, but when you lose,\nyou have regrets.
Let’s give it everything we’ve got so we have no\nregrets with each other!
I gave it everything I had, but I have nothing\nbut regrets...
When you talk about the strongest, you’re\ntalking about me! I’m second to none!
There’s no way you can beat the strongest!\nI’m seriously amazing!
You beat me! Me, the strongest! How can I lose?!
When you talk about the strongest, you’re\ntalking about me! So just follow my lead!
There’s no way that the strongest could lose!\nIt must be your fault!
The pure and cute type is my everyday persona.
I can only be my true self in a place like this.
Creating a persona for life is comfortable but also\nconstraining, isn’t it?
Well, if you’re next to me, I can probably show\nmy true persona.
We lost, but that was still refreshing. Give me\nanother call sometime when you’re free.
Since when I was dumped by my boyfriend, I\nguess I’ve gotten stronger.
Even if I’m strong in battles, it’s meaningless if I’m\nnot popular.
Escapism is also more helpful than you’d think.
I’m gonna fight together with you? Well, I guess\nthat’s cool with me...
Like, when you’re next to me, I’m starting to\nfeel unpopular...
I wanna take over the world when I grow up.
You lost, so you can be my faithful servant.
If my dream comes true, there’s no way I’ll forgive you.
I’ll do my best together with you, my servant, so\nI can take over the world.
I’m going home! You go home, too, servant!
They call me a child prodigy, but that’s tough on\nme, since I’m still just a novice.
Just being naturally brilliant, it’s tough dealing with so\nmuch expectation.
It’s beyond annoying having to deal with the unfortunate\nexpectations of my parents and teachers.
I see that you’ve chosen me. Now we’ll see if I\ncan live up to expectations.
I’ve failed... I’ll apply myself, since I’m still\na novice.
My dad caught them for me. I dunno if\nthey’re strong.
Those Pokémon were strong. Thanks, Dad.
Those Pokémon were weak. My dad is dumb.
This time my dad caught strong Pokémon\nfor me.
They’re still weak. My dad is a stupid-head.
My mommy and daddy aren’t here, but I’m OK\nbecause of my Pokémon.
If all my Pokémon are around, every day is fun.
I’m gonna make my Pokémon a house when I get bigger.
My big brother and big sister aren’t here.\nThis is exciting.
Thanks, Traaaiiiner! You’re as cool as\nmy Pokémon!
I’ve found from taking constant journeys that\none’s life doesn’t change from those journeys.
Life does resemble a journey, but journeys are actually\njust journeys.
Life itself is a journey. Guess I’ve gotta get going somewhere.
Even though I haven’t figured out the point of\njourneys, for you to call wandering ol’ me...
It was just like we were on a journey together.\nThat’s what the battle was like. Thanks!
I’ve been constantly traveling for a number of\nyears, so there’s no region I don’t know about.
Hotels and the road are my home. I can go anywhere\nby myself.
I’d like there to be a dude around just for someone to simply\nsay “welcome home” to me.
I’ll show you the know-how I’ve developed from\ntraveling around the world.
...The barriers to battle are thicker than the\nbarriers of the world.
Sorry to keep you waiting. ♪ It’s time for the\nHiker to enter, who is an idol to some. ♪
I won’t let being in the minority get me down. ♪\nI gotta be me. ♪ And I am alive. ♪
I don’t need to be praised by others. ♪\nI can validate myself. ♪
Sorry to keep you waiting. ♪\nThe Hiker is here. ♪ Thanks for picking me. ♪
Sorry to bring you down... I’ll do better next time.\nSee you...
Finally, it’s my turn! I was totally sick of waiting!
After all that waiting, this is the result? You don’t have\nmuch guts, do you?
Pretty impressive that you were able to beat me! You’re\ngonna be big-time!
I was totally sick of waiting! You waited too long\nto call me!
Didn’t have enough guts... I should eat\nsomething that gives me stamina...
Can you get ahead by working hard? Seems like\nthat’s not the kind of era we’re in.
If I don’t do things halfheartedly enough, I look like a fool.\nYou would, too.
You’ve gotta preserve your personal life, or you’ll have no \ntime for romance, y’know?
Set a record by fighting intensely? That\nmight be appealing to the person I like...
This is nice because it’s fun. I don’t care about\nany records.
I was so busy with work that I neglected to care\nfor my Pokémon...
OK, time to head home and give them their due care.
See, they betray you if you don’t pay attention to them! The\nsame is true for people or Pokémon.
I haven’t been caring for them lately, so I \nwonder if my Pokémon will listen to me...
Yep, they just totally pouted. Don’t let that\nhappen to you...
What’s important at work is to be halfhearted,\nbut in a good way.
As long as I’m emotionally prepared, my victory is assured.
Not just working hard but managing things well is what\nmakes a grown-up. ♪
I’ll give ya some tricks for making it through\nsociety e-z!
If you lose and get irritated each time, you’ll\nlook silly. Watch out for that.
When I’m tired and go home, only Pokémon make\nme feel welcome in that dark room.
These little guys are my support. I can’t live without ’em.
I’m Pokémon dependent. But even so, it’s better than\nbeing alone.
I’m so dependent on Pokémon that I’m kinda\nawkward with people.
This battle was kind of a rehabilitation, I guess.
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!\nI am rubbish!
It’s been 10-plus years since I was born saying, “goo goo\nga ga!” I walk the rubbish-filled highways!
I was born to rubbish and I adhere to rubbish! My scattered\nthoughts are due to rubbish!
Oh! Sorry to keep you waiting! This rubbish\nrushed here!
This rubbishy result is because of rubbish!\nIt’s no fault of yours!
I’ve got more than enough of every kind of\nbadness, but I don’t mess with Pokémon.
Messing with Pokémon stoops below even what brutes do.
For real though, I feel so bad for the Pokémon that I don’t\nlike battles.
...Oh, I guess you called me. Cool, let’s do this\nthen, I guess.
Why couldn’t we wreck those Trainers? If we\nhad, then our Pokémon wouldn’t have to suffer.
If you’ve got a goal, it’s no time to worry about\nhow you achieve it.
You might have to be cowardly, because it’s meaningless if\nyou can’t achieve results.
Heh heh heh. Those were some pretty underhanded\nmethods...but that’s what it is to be a Trainer.
I’m not picky about how I do it.\n’Cause I want results.
I’m still way too soft, too... I’ve gotta get way\nmore underhanded...
I was brought up with tender care, and I became\na fool with flying colors.
For you to lose to me, you must also be kind of—
I don’t hold any grudges toward anyone, but my foolishness\ncan’t be cured.
For you to pick this pathetic-looking fool... Could\nit be that we are birds of a feather?
This is what happens when you pick a fool, but\nyou were also pretty considerable.
Feels like it’s the bottom of the ninth! I’ve gotta\nget a hit. When will I get a hit?!
Aah... Can you hear them? The cheers of admiration for me...
I wonder if this will be my retirement...
I’ll show you how I can hit in this game! You’ll be\nmy coach!
C’mon, I said you were the coach... Now I’ll\nhave fewer highlights...
I’m announcing it right here! This battle!\nI’ve got it!
Hahaha! Just as I announced! A perfect victory for me!
I shouldn’t make any promises I can’t keep, like\nannouncements or declarations.
I’m announcing it right here! I’m your teammate!
It was just as I announced! Well, it was a\nperfect defeat!
I took up tennis for the sake of losing weight,\nbut I ended up—
Argh, I can’t lose weight. Just moving makes me eat.
Like, I keep putting on muscle, so I’m honestly a bit macho.
In tennis terms, we’re playing doubles.\nThat’s our relationship.
Your footwork is so light... What do you do\neach day...?
Look at that cute face... I’ll mess it up for you!
There ya go! Bend that cute face even more! There ya go!
When I see a cute kid, I can’t help but want to tease them.
All right! Let’s go mess up cute kids together!
Even when we lose, the fact that you’re stewing\nnext to me...I’m fine with that.
I just came here nonchalantly, without anyone\nexpecting anything of me.
But there may be meaning and value to carrying on.
My ability to continue ends here, and I guess I do, too.
I’m only capable of acting nonchalantly, so I\nhope that won’t bother you.
That’s the extent of my ability. I appreciate\nyour partnership.
The Pokémon I raised aren’t all like yours.
The battle begins from the stage of raising Pokémon.
That’s how my Pokémon are...\nYou’re a worthy connoisseur, too.
I’m OK with pitching in with the Pokémon\nI raised.
Those were pretty well raised, too. I couldn’t\nhelp but lose to them.
I’m OK with crying now as long as I’m able to\nhave the last laugh.
I’ll be able to rejoice much later. I’m aiming for\nsomething higher.
If I convert my frustration to hard work, I’ll surely\nget stronger.
Be with me now so we can have the last laugh.
Let’s remember this loss so we can aim\nhigher, together.
Rather than following an unlikely possibility, I’ve\ngot to know my limitations.
However hard I work, my limit is Rising Star.
I can’t trust people who speak of hopes and dreams.
Despite knowing my own limitations, I’ll try hard,\nso relax.
This is the limit for a Rising Star.\nSorry about that.
Hey, I bought souvenirs!\nI bought a ton of them!
I absolutely adore shopping! I’m a shopping fool!
Gotta buy! I’m gonna buy more right after this! I wanna buy so\nmuch stuff that the shop has to shut down!
Hey, I’ll battle! I’ll battle a ton for you!
I absolutely adore battles! I’m a battling fool!
I came on a bargain-priced tour, so the vacation\natmosphere is just about zero.
Buy cheap and you waste your money! That’s really well said.
Being here is my part-time job, and I’ve gotta make money or\nI’ll have no lodgings!
I’m here on a bargain-priced tour, so I can’t even\ngo to tourist spots.
The trailer towed by a bicycle hasn’t come to\nmeet me, so I’m not busy. Call me again, OK?
I’ve come here on my honeymoon to battle!\nI’m beyond saving!
My husband ran off a long time ago! But I’m having fun, so I’m\nOK with it!
It’s so fun that I can’t hold back! I guess I’m just a\nhopeless case!
My husband ran off since I’m always in battles,\nso I’ve been looking for my next partner.
I haven’t done enough battling by a long shot!\nDo you want to have another battle?!
Oh, I spent some money! I got totally into buying\neverything up!
I’m still gonna do a bunch more shopping! I won’t be able to\nbring it all home, but I’ll still buy it!
My trunk is stuffed with souvenirs! But I’m still gonna buy\nlike crazy!
Oh, I threw some Poké Balls! But I still wanna\nthrow more!
My arm is swollen from throwing so many\nPoké Balls! But I still wanna throw more!
I’m a clean freak, so the job I have now is\nmy calling.
The way I am, I can’t stand even a speck of dust, so my\nfamily suffers.
I scrub my Pokémon three times a day so they shine.
I’m a clean freak, so I demand cleanliness in\nmy partner.
One of our opponents was unclean, so\nI panicked.
I will judge whether you are unclean!
Uh-oh! You are unclean! I sentence you to\npunishment—cleaning!
Safe! You are pretty clean! But I sentence you to\npunishment—scrubbing!
Let’s you and I judge together whether the\nworld is clean!
Unfortunately, everyone is clean...\nThat’s really pretty boring...
Pokémon battles are popular at my work site, so\nit’s causing me trouble.
It’s OK if it’s just a momentary fad, but it’s really interfering\nwith work.
Even I, the foreman, am hooked. So frankly, we’re really\nbehind on the construction schedule.
I came because you called, even though I’m\nactually in the middle of work.
Well...result aside, I’m afraid to head back...
You risk your life being a Worker, but it’s\nplenty fulfilling.
I’m happy that I was able to boast of my work to you.
There’s a spirit of adventure to constructing buildings and\nbridges that last 100 years, isn’t there?
I’m by myself working away from home\nright now, so I’m glad you called.
Now I have a good yarn to tell to the kids in my\nhometown.
Palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and\naged eyes... I’m like a department store full of\r\nchronic diseases.
“Old but still healthy” is like calling oneself a cyborg, if you\nask me.
Hospital? There’s no way I’ll go! I bet my character\nwould crumble.
I’ve got high blood pressure, thinning hair, and\nold-person odor, but leave this to me.
Since I’m always at my limit, I can’t really get any\nmore worn out now.
I’ve got money to burn and I’m quite popular: I’m\na winner.
Do I look happy? I’m actually not.
I’ve had bad luck only with Pokémon. The ones I have\nwith me now are borrowed.
While the Pokémon I have are borrowed, I got \nthem from a good place.
In the end, this might be the limit when it comes\nto another person’s Pokémon.
Aging gracefully takes a lot of behind the\nscenes work.
Through unseemly struggle, somehow I look the way I do now.
Don’t give me that look like, “I’m not interested in what this\nold lady has to say.”
Oh, I haven’t heard from you in a while. You \nmust want to hear what I have to say.
Don’t give me that look like, “It must be this old\nlady’s fault.”
Winners and losers arise from battle.
You can become stronger by understanding the frustration of\nthe loser.
Your expression is like, “I’m not interested in what this old\nperson has to say...”
Once again, we’re at the point where winners\nand losers arise from battle.
It seems like maybe you have an expression like,\n“It must be this old person’s fault...”
You smile with your face while you weep in your\nheart. That’s the service industry for ya.
The smile of the service industry is simply business.
The corpse of one’s tattered pride is the source of the\nbest hospitality.
I’m in the service industry, but I won’t flatter\nmy partner.
We provided service to the opponent. This, too,\nis the nature of the industry.
There are no Pokémon allowed at my hotel.
If the number of customers with no manners increases, you\nstart to feel constrained.
There are so many customers who just let their Pokémon do\nthis or that.
Let’s fight, while following the rules and\nmaintaining our manners.
We got too caught up in manners and left them\nan opening.
Since I got super into golf, I picked up the habit\nof doing practice swings.
I do practice swings even in my room, so my furniture gets all \nmessed up.
I have more fun doing practice swings than getting onto the\ncourse right now.
Since I got super into golf, Pokémon battles are\nkinda meh.
I think golf suits me better after all.
Point-blank, the hips are common to Pokémon\nbattles and golf!
There’s not enough swing in your hips! Twist more! Twist!
The swing in the hips decides the battle! All right, furiously\nswing with your hips!
I’m particular about motion in the hips! You\nbetter watch out!
It’s ’cause there wasn’t enough swing in our\nhips! We’ve gotta go at it more furiously!
Women have their weapons! Pokémon have\ntheir weapons!
You, too—you’ve gotta get your own particular weapon.
Is your weapon maybe your partnership with your Pokémon?
Those with their own weapons can\nseize victory.
You were honestly great. I was the weak link...
Rather than tedious words, we should speak\nwith our arms!
Don’t make fun of me for my slender arms. They are how I\nmake my living!
Is it seriously possible that I can’t hack it? Hey, what exactly\ndo you do?
We’ve got no time for tedious talk! Yeah! Let’s\nget fired up!
Our two-person combination... That’s an issue\nwe need to address...
Milk production is down this year, so my farm is\nin trouble.
I’ll have to go to town to work, or it’ll be tough to get by\nthis year.
In a business with living creatures as partners, it’s pretty\ntough to read the future.
Even though my farm is in trouble this year, I\nfound myself coming here.
Even though I know I need to go and work away\nfrom home, it’s so fun here that I don’t go.
Milk production is up this year, so it’s all smiles\nat my farm.
There’s certainly some risk in a business with living\ncreatures as partners.
I’ll be able to live a life of ease this year. Maybe I’ll even get a\nnew car.
It’s all smiles at my farm this year, so I’m able to\nspend my time at play.
If I live idly like this, next year’s figures will\nbe terrible.
Stop in and have a look at these\nextraordinary Pokémon!
Whaddya think? Great Pokémon, aren’t they? Why don’t you\nbuy one?
Whoa, hey! Don’t mess up the merchandise!
My extraordinary Pokémon! Let’s get down\nto business!
They’re not selling at all... What’s wrong\nwith them...?
C-come on! Quick! Bring it on!
Wh-what? I win sometimes!
O-OK! I gave it everything I had!
H-here we come! ’Cause we’re coming on fast!
Wh-what? That look! I gave it everything I had!
O-OK! Shall we let loose, splashily,\naround here?
Fiiiirrrre!
Ugh... Ughhhh... What happened?
O-OK! Shall you and I let it all loose?
Ughh... I’m fine... You go on ahead of me...
Ah, when was the last time...I met a Trainer\nlike you...?
That dreaming-of-the-future look... It’s tough for me just to\nlook at you...
I’m sure that you, too, will figure it out eventually...\nThe “future”—there’s nothing...
It’s a little tough for me to have to join up with a\nTrainer like you.
To not give up despite losing... That kind of look\nis hard for me to take...
You mean you don’t know about me?! I’m \nexperienced, so I hate dealing with newbies!
After this, have I been etched in your mind?
To lose to a little newbie... I myself feel like I have sunk...
You know about me, right? So relax!
To lose to that lot of newbies... We ourselves\nfeel like we have sunk...
Let’s just say that it’s rare for there to be a\nTrainer who can beat me.
See? Just like I told you! I’m pretty strong!
It had been a while since I’d lost! You’re pretty good!
If you’re a Trainer who’ll partner up with me, you\ngonna get pretty revved up out there?
You did pretty well! Call me again sometime!
You must be my opponent! OK! Come on with it!
Take it to heart! The true strength of a Collector!
Hoohaha! Not bad! I can accept you as my rival!
Hoohaha! My rival! Well then, onward!
Hoohaha! I’ve gotta stop! I look forward to\nnext time!
...Draw.
Heh...
Ack!
...Guess I’ll come.
Ack!
Feels like that ace label keeps dogging me...
Whew... With this, I was able to retain my ace label...
I’ve had it! This stupid ace thing! Even though I’d be fine\nwith being ordinary!
I’ve got the ace label! You’ve gotta help\nme out!
No! I wasn’t to blame! But then again, neither\nwere you!
I appreciate this!\n...Even though I’m off, it’s a regular customer...
That was really instructive!\n...I’ve seriously gotta try to be nice...
As expected, you’re quite strong!\n...This is just my business smile...
I appreciate this!\n...It’s that regular customer again...
I’m sorry, I wasn’t strong enough.\n...Well, I did what I could...
I’ve tried training in admiration of a hero I saw\nwhen I was a kid...
Ah... I’m really an incurable fool...
In reality, there’s no need for so-called heroes.
You resemble the hero I used to admire...
So-called heroes are really useless after all...
As long as my skin is elastic enough to make\nwater bead off, I’ll insist I’m a Beauty. ♪
Skin care after the battle! You better do it, too!
How to look like a Beauty... That’s my main issue in life...
Leave it to me, I who look exactly like a Beauty,\neven though I’m a Veteran. ♪
Oh no... These crow’s-feet... I’ve got to take care\nof them immediately...

Show it to me—the true power of the first\nChampion of Alola!
This is what I, Kanto’s top-level Trainer, can really do!
How did I lose? You really are the real deal!
[~ 958]
[~ 959]
The winner takes everything, and there’s\nnothing left for the loser.
If somebody wins, the person who fought against that person\nwill lose.
When one loses, they lose everything... The next thing I’ll look\nfor will be victory, too!
I’ll follow my role until I’m able to serve as\nyour partner.
I was unable to fulfill my role... All I can do is\ndeeply apologize...
Being here somehow makes me nostalgic...\nI remember those days...
That was fun... Thank you...
Your talent...it’s real.
Well, I have let up on my mission, so I’ll join up\nwith you.
The result aside, it was a good fight.
I trained in Hoenn to take on the world. Please\nhave a look at my results!
Let’s battle again sometime!
I’ve lost...
I hope you can bear with me, Champion!
...Still, don’t you count on us just losing to\nyou forever.
I’m glad! I’ll be able to bring out the power of\nPokémon by battling you!
I’ll file away info on this fighting style of yours!
Splendid! You are quite the Trainer!
The secret for bringing out the power of\nPokémon! I’ll learn it from you!
Seems like the wearable I’m so proud of wasn’t\nfunctioning well, right?
I, Cynthia, accept your challenge! There won’t\nbe any letup from me!
Even if you lose, never lose your love of Pokémon.
No matter how fun the battle is, it will always end sometime...
If I fight alongside you, I can learn everything\nabout you!
How frustrating! It ended before I could\nunderstand you and your Pokémon!
I don’t believe that people understand each\nother if they battle, but I’ll face you anyway.
I’ve got pride, too. I mean, I was in Team Skull.
Yeah, yeah, you win... You’re really a big deal!
I can’t believe I’m teaming up with you... I’m not\nsure why fate has brought us together, but\r\ndon’t let me down!
Aww, what’s wrong? Could it be that the\nChampion is not very good at the Battle Tree?
Doesn’t matter who I’m up against, I’m gonna\nbeat them down! That’s what big bad Guzma is\r\nall about!
Not yet! I could still keep wrecking! Come at me\nas many times as you want!
I guess that’s how it is, Champion! But I’m not beat down yet!
Heh, I like the looks of this! If it’s you and me,\nwe can beat anyone down!
Yeah, when it comes to you and me, we’re best\nat wrecking each other!
I’ll fully display the vaunted dancing of\nmy Pokémon!
Win or lose, there’s never enough dancing!
Win or lose, there’s never enough dancing!
If we are truly strong, surely we can win even if\nwe dance as we please!
Sorry! I need to keep practicing my dancing...
Thanks for stopping by! Here’s today’s\nMallow Special!
You taste defeat when you can’t draw out the\nexcellence of your Pokémon.
Abilities must have been the secret ingredient!\nThere are many recipes for battle!
With your Pokémon, I can produce a flavor\nthat no one can imagine!
Now we’ve done it! We got greedy and mixed\ntogether a bunch of flavors, and it didn’t work!
OK! Let’s get this show on the road!
Tee hee! We didn’t act as masked heroes just for show.
Brilliant and intense...you demonstrate a wonderful\nfighting style.
Leave it to me, I who am always\nsupporting Dexio!
I’m sorry... Maybe I can’t fight well in Multi\nBattles without Dexio.
Then I’ll let my partners go wild!
I’m glad I could show off the results of my training with Sina.
Terrific! I hope you’ll put victory and defeat on the line\nagainst the Kalos Champion!
Let’s show them our combination in which each\nof us lets the excellence of the other shine!
Forgive me... Of course, if I were with Sina, we’d\nbe an invincible duo...

Let’s have a battle, first Champion of Alola!
This is what I, Kanto’s top-level Trainer, can really do!
OK! You’re pretty good!
[~ 1023]
[~ 1024]
My Pokémon and I are gonna go all out! And\nthat’s how we’ll find the strongest move!

I heard something good happens if you battle \nanother Trainer!
Hey, losing isn’t something good!
I guess the something good was that I got to \nmeet you through the battle!
Hey, Pokémon Trainers always seem to be \npeople who like Pokémon, right?\r\nIsn’t that strange?
I got it!\nYou must love Pokémon, too!
Even if a Pokémon doesn’t like you,\nif you tell it that you like it every day,\r\nit will grow to love you!
When you stay up at night, don’t you\nget sleepy?
I’m not getting enough sleep!
There are Pokémon that can sleep and recharge\neven while battling!
Hoooo-wah!
Hoooo-wah!
Hoooo-wah!
What? It’s already over?!
What? It’s already over?!
What? It’s already over?!
Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
Sensational!
To think that you’ve wounded my pride,\nwhich is harder than diamonds!
[~ 26]
[~ 27]
Yo, I’m feelin’ mad annoyed that my team just got destroyed.
For real?!
Don’t worry—I’ll heal any pain that was caused by our defeat!
No! The Grimer I found in the tall grass near the school\nwas defeated?!
Whoa! Well played!
Metapod...here, have a Berry.
Go for it, Caterpie! Show me the power of\nBug-type Pokémon!
I lost with my Bug-type Pokémon! You’re really bugging me,\nyou know?
Bug-type Pokémon become powerful quickly!\nI’m gonna do my best to raise ’em!
Let’s go!\nKneecaps!
Aww...\nBrought to my knees.
I gotta catch more Pokémon!\nPokémon with cool knees are so neat.
[~ 40]
[~ 41]
[~ 42]
Hey! Please battle me!
If you’re strong, please go away!
Great Trainers can sense promise in\nother Trainers!\r\nDid you pick up on anything?
Alola! Whaddya think?\nI’m pretty good at greetings, huh?\r\nI’m also great at Pokémon battles!
Oh! No!
The awesomeness of your Pokémon!\nYou should take on the world!
I’m looking for Berries to have my\nPokémon hold!
Oh! If only I had given Rockruff a Berry to hold...
Berries lie at the base of trees.\nAfter all, that’s why they are Berries!
Each Pokémon possesses an Ability.\c\nUnderstanding these well leads to victory!
I couldn’t show off the effects of Abilities?!
There are many kinds of Pokémon Abilities—\c\nsome that produce effects in battle, and some\nthat produce effects at other times!
I’ll draw out the power of my partner,\nGrowlithe, by giving it an item to hold!
Being a Trainer, I myself should also have\nused an item!
The item you want a Pokémon to hold will\nchange depending on how you want it to fight!
Do you have preferences about the type of\nmoves in addition to the type of Pokémon?
More preferences, please!
There is a type for moves, just like there is\na type for Pokémon.\c\nWhen the move type is the same as\nthe Pokémon type, it’s more powerful!
Oh! You look comfortable on your Pokémon!
Oh! You look comfortable with your Pokémon!
While it’s also good to ride Pokémon,\nI like swimming with Pokémon.
Life came from the sea!
I want to dive into the sea!\nI’m so ashamed that I want to dive!
Youngsters evolve into Swimmers.\nJust kidding!
All right! Come battle a lady!
Argh!\nYou’re way too strong!
Pokémon seem happy when they get to fully \nunleash a move!
The swaying makes my heart sway, too...\nOh yeah, let me introduce my Pokémon.
That move, this move...\nI’m so confused...
When I float with my Pokémon between the \nwaves, my heart dissolves into the world...
My favorite bikini makes Pokémon happy, too!
It’s tough fetching Poké Balls from my bikini!
My favorite bikini makes Pokémon happy, too!
Wearing that getup seems too hot!\nHave a good sweat in a battle!
My Pokémon and I are in a cold sweat from losing...
In Alola, it’s totally normal to wear a bikini\nfrom morning ’til night!
When I come to the Pokémon cemetery...\nit’s no good because I get so mournful.
I...I’ll try to hold back my tears.
He’s still alive in my heart...\nMaybe that is enough.
I’ll use the moves it was so good at!
Pikachu...
The grave where Pikachu rests...\nI address it using its words.
My Murkrow just loves shiny, sparkly things!
Murkrow! You must shine brighter!
Pokémon and Trainers with a good bond always\nseem to be shining brightly!
Is it cool for me to be in Team Skull if I’m this brittle?

For real?!\nOver already?!
Yes! You have emerged victorious!

Yes! You have emerged victorious!
I’d like to help out as a Trial Guide.\nBut I don’t wanna give you an easy win!
I crammed Pokémon in my backpack,\nbounced around, and now I’m here!
Whoa, looks like I’ve been visited by defeat!
I’ve been traveling everywhere, too, so I totally\nget how fun the island challenges must seem!
I am a Fisherman.\nIn short, I’m a person who fishes for Pokémon!
I can’t stand being caught!
A person who fishes can be called an angler\nor a Fisherman.
[~ 107]
[~ 108]
[~ 109]
Fishing is a path...\c\nIt’s a battle to win against oneself\nin addition to the Pokémon.
Even if I can win against myself, it looks like I’ve\nlost to you!
I calmly wait for the “!” to appear, no\nmatter how much fuss the Pokémon puts up!
When the fishing line has been cast,\na sucker may come along wanting to battle...\r\nEr, a Trainer will be hooked!
Maybe I, myself, became the sucker?
Having a fishing rod is fun because it allows\nyou to meet both Pokémon and Trainers!
The keeper of Ten Carat Hill!\nIt’s refreshing to be overcome!
I’ll teach you some tricks that guarantee\nhooking some Pokémon!
I’m not sure I need to teach you any\nfishing tricks.
If you don’t give up until you catch something,\nyou’ll definitely catch a Pokémon.\c\nIn Pokémon battles as well, if you battle\nuntil you win, you’ll definitely win.
I am a Collector.\nWhich is to say that I collect Pokémon.
Gimme gimme!
Collectors are happy beings.\c\nEven if there are no Pokémon we want,\njust our imagination can make us smile.

I rely on apps for traveling recommendations!
I guess I still haven’t mastered the recommended Rattata.
It’s a mystery as to whose recommendation it is,\nbut Pikachu Valley is apparently really nice.
I think you need to train your Pokémon.
How wonderful!
You should speak up in advance when\nthere’s nothing a Beauty could teach you.
When you speak of the Youngster Anthony, I’m\nthe only one in the Alola region!
You beat me, the only one like me in Alola,\nso you’re great!
When I think about it, you, too, are all alone in\nthe world.\r\nHold on a sec... How great is that!

I’m a Breeder!\nI raise and breed Pokémon!
I’m a Breeder!\nI’m sorry for losing!

Pokémon and Trainer join forces to make a team.
Ah! I’ll swim, too...\nEr, I want to compete together!
I want to win a swimming relay, not as Trainer\nand Pokémon but as members of the same team.
Welcome to my mini-island.
I-I lost.\nBecause I won’t budge!
Well, I guess you can stay\nhere too on my mini-island.
Swimming is full-body exercise!\nIt’s toned muscle tactics!
Toned muscle flexes spontaneously.
Muscle is important for Pokémon, too!\c\nIt’s the muscles, not the brain, that decide\nwhich move to use in battle!
Oh come onnn...\c\nI wonder where I can go to spend time alone\nwith my Pokémon.
You’re actually not a bother.\nThanks for a little excitement.
Pokémon that don’t say anything\nare perfect for me right now...
Alola Trainers have a different charm than those in Kalos!
New encounters help people and Pokémon grow\nand mature!
Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
How annoying!
Bone-dry!
I was unprepared! Perhaps I did not put\nenough emotion into the dance.
Wr-wr-wr-wrecked!
Maybe I should be more selfish since\nit’s a Battle Royal!
It was well fought and I lost fair and square, yeah.\nThat was excellent. I feel great. Woo!
There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
Hmph...\nSo I failed to keep things under control again?
My emotions...\nI guess I was unable to convey them.
[~ 175]
Yo, yo, you...you’re no joke.
Phooey.
How lovely.
One plus one is two, but it could also be three\nor four.
I’m too young for math!
There are some Trainers who will challenge you\nas a pair, like us.
You’ve got just one Pokémon?\nAt that count, we can’t fight.
There’s no way we’ll lose!\nIt’s important to feel strong!
A loss and a loss make a double loss!
The tears we cry when we lose make\nus stronger.
You’ve got just one Pokémon?\nThen sorry, we can’t battle.
If it’s all right with you, battle with us!
Oh my gosh!
We admire Dexio and Sina, the great\nduo from the Kalos region!
You’ve gotta have two Pokémon to battle\nwith us as a duo!
Combos that can’t be used alone can be\nused when there are two of us!
Combos are so difficult.\nBut that’s why they’re fun!
Those mysterious people, Sina and Dexio,\nare solving all sorts of cases!
This is a 2-on-2 Pokémon battle!\nYou don’t have enough healthy Pokémon.
Battles are the best for raising Pokémon!
Even if Pokémon lose...it’s OK as long as the Trainer\ngrows from that.
Trainers also grow through raising Pokémon.
[~ 198]

One of the duties of a Breeder is to discover\nand refine the strengths of Pokémon.
I wanna know what my strengths are!
The more you learn about Pokémon, the more\nfascinating they become!
Alola! I’m Caleb. Let’s give each other a look at\nour Pokémon!
Your Pokémon—so cool!
I don’t mind Youngster, but I wanna be called\nthat boy in shorts!
[~ 207]
[~ 208]
[~ 209]
Here I go!
It’s over!
Nothing!
So!\nWhat do you think of the largeness of my area?!
Whoa! A large-scale Trainer!
In my case, my volume is large in addition to\nmy area!
I was losing constantly, so I’m on a trip\nto find myself.
I think about why I lost, but I don’t dwell on it!
Even if you dwell on your losses, tomorrow\nis a new day!
Attacking from a high place to a low place is as\neasy as chopping down bamboo.
I guess I wasn’t able to make full use of\nthe potential energy from being in a high place.
The Ability No Guard ensures that all attacks\nwill hit!\r\nYeah, even against Pokémon using Fly!
Trainer detected!\nI will now commence the attack!
An honorable defeat!\nI lost, but it was invigorating!
I had climbed to a high place...\nI was hoping for a way to get down.\c\nSo my thanks to you!
Research! Research!\nI shall research the Pokémon!
I present the results of my research!\nThis person’s Pokémon—strong!
A further research topic is how to defeat\nstrong Pokémon.
The sea and beach are so nice.\nJust being here broadens my mind!
Me as I am now, I can tolerate losing.
Battling for enjoyment without worrying\nabout winning or losing is also nice.
Hee hee... Wanna help\nme pass the time?
Nuh-uh!
Maybe you’re a little too stoked?
Good wind! Good waves!\nAbove all, my good mood!
I guess my Pokémon weren’t in such a good mood...
You can catch the flow if your Pokémon\nuse moves while in a good mood!
Can you tell me how you chose your\npartner Pokémon?
I have trouble deciding on my partners,\nbecause there are so many criteria.
Traveling along the surface of the water on a\nRide Pokémon feels great, doesn’t it?
The best thing about Swimmers?\c\nThere is nothing for us other than Pokémon!\nWe represent freedom.
I’m empty-handed, but I do have the prize money\nto pay you.
A place to put away Poké Balls?\nThat’s the mystery of Swimmers, isn’t it?
I’ll attack you boldly in my bold bikini!
Left watered-down at the waterfront!
Bikinis and Pokémon battles are\ntotally unrelated.
Which Pokémon do you think is fitting with the\ngrave? Let’s battle. Perhaps you’ll figure it out.
Is it Ghost type after all?\nI’m also looking for something that’s unexpected.
The graves in Akala have been here\na long time...\r\nThat’s why this is a tourist spot.
I thought I’d have a little gander at the\nRuins of Life.\r\nBut there’s one thing to do first!
Quite skillfully done!
Tapu Lele visits the Ruins of Life...\nIt’s considered to be the vitalizing Pokémon.
Punk Girl sounds scary, doesn’t it?\c\nPlease be friendly and call me Punky.
You’re...the calm, cool, and collected type, aren’t you?
With these flashy looks but polite expressions,\nI deceive and confuse my opponents.
People in graves are sleeping forever, right?
Aah... I’m getting sleepy!
If they’re sleeping and won’t wake up, just give\nthem a Chesto Berry to hold.
Good morning!\nMornin’ for short!
You played that battle well!\nGG for short!
Thanks for being my opponent!\nTY for short!
I fish when I think I can catch something.\nI battle when I think I can win.
Would’ve been nice if I could’ve won just by thinking\nI could win.
I fish when I think I can catch something.\nI fish when I believe I can catch something.\r\nThey are similar but different.
Work through brute force doesn’t go well!
Your power is beyond what I imagined!
Doing calculations allows you to tap into\nyour power!
Dig a hole!
If there was a hole here, I’d wanna crawl into it!\nI wanna dig a hole and hide!
Dig a hole! If I dug it, I’d wanna fill it up.\nMy soul cries out at me to do that!
Whether in battles or in digging tunnels,\nPokémon are incredible!
The same is true for my Pokémon, but your\nPokémon—incredible!
This was originally a path dug by Diglett.\c\nDiglett let us use it as well, so we maintain\nit out of gratitude!
Eat well, sleep well...then it’s time for a\nproper battle!
I’ve had enough!\nI can’t fight anymore.
A Trainer’s Pokémon don’t grow if they are\nleft alone.\c\nAlthough when I eat meals, I naturally\ngrow horizontally.
Are you raising Pokémon?
Maybe, in addition to providing care, raising means\ndrawing out talents?
I’ve built up the lower body of my Pokémon\nthrough the undulations on the ranch!\c\nI guess what I need to use most is myself...
All right! Trial-goer, have a look at my kid.
You’re growing rapidly.\nThat’s wonderful!
Trainer and Pokémon are like parent and child!\nJust seeing them cheerful makes you happy!
Look at the lustrous heads of my Pokémon!
My Pokémon are cute, even when they lose!
I can’t help petting the heads of my Pokémon!\c\nIt seems there are even Pokémon that\nwill high-five you if you hold up your hand!
I keep repeating fair battles with Pokémon\nand Trainers.\r\nWhat kind of person is a Fisherman...?
Joy when I hook it...\nSadness when it gets away...
Life bobs up and down...\nI think while watching the bobber...\c\nI could catch rare Pokémon from rock\npiles with bubbles spouting from them...
You’re a fool if you dance...\nand a fool if you just look on!
My stomach is crying and saying “urgent”!
My stomach is crying and saying “urgent”!
It’s fine with me.\nI’ve grown tired of eating rich meals.
It’s fine with me.\nI’ve grown tired of eating rich meals.
Argh, the humiliation...\nWell, eat heartily, at least.

I don’t know if you care, but that bus stop weighs about\nas much as Golem!
You’re with Kukui...\nLooks like he brought along a good Trainer.
I see.\nGreat work...I guess.
You, you!
Hmmph! I can’t even stand myself right now!
If attacking from the front doesn’t work, what about\nfrom the rear... I’ve got a lot to think about!
A lookout has to be strong for when the time comes!
You’re on a whole other level than me.\nI’ve just got to laugh at myself...
Ack! The island challenge has made you way too strong!
Yeah, yeah.\nI gotta admit, that was great!
Hmph... How annoying.
Hmph...
[~ 335]
Aiyee!
Hmm...It seems as though I may have lost.
I haven’t done enough development work on\nPokémon battles!
You really do just win, don’t you?\nHonesty seems like the way to go.
It’s not a particularly original line, but wherever there\nis light, there is also shadow.
There is another world that cannot be brought\nabout through idle talk... Got it?
That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!
That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!

I gotta keep the boss from getting his hands\ndirty, so I’m gonna wreck you myself!

The boss is not gonna be happy about this...\c\nI wish he would punish my Pokémon instead\nof me!
Aiyee!
Here’s an impression for you: Aiyee!
Hmph... That’s Faba for you.
This is for the sponsor who supports\nTeam Skull!
All our strength comes from the money we’ve gotten...
I’ll do anything if you pay me for it!\c\nLike, let’s see... Wanna see me get hit with\nHyper Beam?
Hey, what’s up with you?\nHow come I can’t smash you?!
How...how can you be so awful!
Ow, that hurts! Even my heart hurts!
Our 500 percent is, like, what\npercentage of your strength?!
Thud! That’s the sound of your\nstrength rocking me to my core!
Aaauuuggghhhhhhhhh!!!
Hmph.\nThere’s nothing more to say.
I could feel the power you gained\non your journey through Alola.
Really lovely...both you and your Pokémon...
I’m...I’m speechless! You’ve done me in!
It’s frustrating to me as a member of the Elite Four,\nbut it seems your strength is the real deal.
I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!

Oh my gosh! I’ve gotta go see\nKiawe’s fiery dance with Pokémon!
If it’s a mountain, I’ve gotta climb it!\nThat’s the spirit of the Hiker!
There are some mountains I can’t climb...\nI’m talking about you and your Pokémon!
I’ve gotta first climb down the mountain.\nI’m off to be able to climb the next one...
Allow me to show you the ace Kadabra of an\nAce Trainer!
Aah!\nI blacked out!
I want to make my Kadabra evolve! Friends...\nI need friends!
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh!\c\nMy impression of a siren is pretty good, eh?\nI’m pretty good at Pokémon battles, too.
You’re something else! You’re better\nat Pokémon battles than I am!
I want to put a siren on Tauros and\nmake it exclusive to Police Officers.
I know so much about rare Pokémon!
You see...rare Pokémon are too special to be used\nfor fighting...
Shiny Pokémon are too special to be\nshown off...
Were you bothered by this Beauty\nstrolling along? Or by my Pokémon?
You bother me!
Telling someone their Pokémon are cute\nis a good way to strike up a conversation.

Even if I did forget to put on my shorts, get\nready for me and my stoked Pokémon!
Wait, so I actually am wearing shorts?
If I forgot to put on my shorts, I’d be just an\nordinary kid!
Pokémon battles are life.\nYou’re bashing our way of life!
The joy of victory...the agony of defeat...that’s life.
Whether I win or lose, my life will go on.\nI’m not gonna mope around forever.
It’s important for Pokémon to be cute\nand strong!
It’s possible to lose when you’re cute\nand strong? What’s up with that?
We just need to get cuter and stronger!
Moves with high accuracy.\nMoves with high power...\r\nHey! Allow me to experiment!
You’ve got to be able to read your opponent’s\nthoughts in addition to the statistics of a move!

The reason I don’t ride Lapras is because\nI can swim faster than Lapras.

I can’t compete with the swimming speed of\nSharpedo and Poliwrath!
Abs! Abs!
My Frillish and I were distracted by our surroundings...
If you go on a date at the beach, you can see\nyour girl’s swimsuit...\c\nThat’s what I was thinking, but my girl’s been\ntraining the whole time.
You’ve got just one Pokémon? That will\nmake it too tough for you to fight with us.
When I get in the ocean, I get pricked by\nCorsola or Pyukumuku!
Argh! It’s ’cause Frillish is just so adorable!
Pokémon stick to me just like Shellder biting\ndown on Slowbro’s tail...
You’ve gotta have two Pokémon if you wanna\nbattle us!
You’re gonna fully experience my\nWater-based tactics!
Bubble, bubble, bubble...\nI sink and I dive...
My swim trunks are out of respect\nfor Machamp!
Hee-hee, I’m not a mermaid.\nI’m a Pokémon Trainer in a bikini!
Oh! Stormy!

I hate serious people, yo.\c\nI am serious about being a\nTeam Skull Grunt, though!
Even if you work seriously, you won’t always get results!
Hmph! Since you’re serious...lemme give you a\ntip, yo.\c\nYo, yo, ya don’t stop.\nEven if you lose, ya don’t stop!
I’m a grand Grunt.\nThe Pokémon Carnivine is my fave.
Yep, I lost. I got crushed.
I’m a grand Grunt. Carnivine is my fave, but I\ndon’t have one.
No one has lost today. What a lovely, good day!
Aww, I lost... What a terrible, bad day...
Who can I take out the sadness of this loss on?\nAnyway, sadness for me and Team Skull.
Hunh? Everything around here seems like a\nTeam Skull paradise.
I might really go to paradise now that I’ve lost!
Aaah! I wish I had taken the island challenge\nmore seriously!
Surrounded by flowers...\nI’m...gorgeous...
Ahh! The flower I am has fallen.
Flowers and young women...\nour impermanence makes us gorgeous...
Do you know about super, strong Pokémon?
I said “super,” but I meant\nsomething a little different.
The fluffy ones are really the super Pokémon!
Today is Pokémon day!
I’m fine ’cause I’m with Cleffa.
If I’m in a tough spot, Cleffa sends me to\nmy house.
All right! Time for a commemorative photo!\nJust need you to lose for me, ’K?
What did I say...\nWhat...did I say...
I got overexcited by my journey!\nI should just go to the Alola Photo Club if I want\r\ncommemorative photos, right?
When I’m traveling, I just want to\npoint out everything!
I disclosed everything...\neverything about my Pokémon!
I always get a little down when I get home.\nMaybe I can travel forever?
Listen up, Trainer.\nBattle is a Hiker’s favorite.
Listen up, Trainer.\nA Hiker hates to lose.
Listen up, Trainer.\c\nA Hiker’s most favorite are big and\ntough Pokémon!\r\nAnd next is a big helping of rice!
By battling a Collector, you’ll be able to obtain\ninfo on rare Pokémon!
You got me! I’ll tell you my treasured info.

This is a fitting outcome for me, incomplete as\nI am—the end!
The boss is a complete bully, but I’m an\nincomplete Grunt.\c\nSometimes I want to smash the world,\nbut I’m always afraid of it.
I’ll stop you so Guzma will stay chill!
This is terrible, yo... The mansion is gonna get\nwrecked again!
Guzma... Even though he’s so strong, he wasn’t\nable to become a captain!
An uninvited guest... Do you have an invitation?
I guess that attack was your alternative to an invitation!
No! I wish I had never come here! Probably\nbecause three passwords are needed instead\r\nof an invitation. And I lost the memos with\r\nthe passwords somewhere in the mansion!
So sorry! As a stranger, you get a full course of\nmy Pokémon’s moves!
Your full course...it’s got way too much seasoning!
I always make sweet pancakes or sweet Berry\ncakes, yo.
Hey! So you think peeking in people’s rooms is\nin good taste?!
At least your Pokémon have good taste...
What does it mean to say “in good taste”?\nIs it like saying it’s cosmopolitan? Is there such\r\na thing as a cosmopolitan Pokémon?
Ooh, looking for a battle in a romantic\nspot, hmm?
I guess nobody likes Team Skull after all...
Even this dreamy balcony is\nsurrounded by the town, so it’s boring.\c\nYo, check it! Surrounded by surroundings,\nit’s so astounding!\c\nIck! Never mind, that was terrible!
One, two, hit THREE sandbag.\nFour, five, we’re ra-SIX-cals.
After 10 seconds, the bell rings, and it’s a knockout, baby!
It’s a pain to go all the way to the Pokémon\nCenter, so I just sleep next to my Pokémon!
I’m just as good as the woman next to me!
I was just as good as the woman next to me, right?\nRight?
We’re twins, so we’re always being compared.\c\nSo I’m sure you get my wanting to be just as\ngood as her.
Oh? You don’t have two Pokémon?\nIn that case, we can’t take you on.
I stack up to the one next to me!
I’m stronger than the one next to me, right?\nRight?
We’re twins and she’s the big sister,\nso we’re always compared.\r\nSo I’m sure you get my wanting to win.
Oh? You don’t have two Pokémon?\nIn that case, we can’t take you on.

I offer up my dancing in appreciation\nfor receiving Berries.
I forgot to dance for victory...
Long ago, it seems that people related to the\nTapu through dance.
We’re going to show you two Pokémon. It’d be\nunfair if you didn’t show us two, as well!
Let’s have a quick battle while gathering\nBerries together with our Pokémon!
Really, pardon me...
Berries keep for a long time.\c\nFor we who travel the seas, they’re the\nperfect ingredient.
Rare Trainer discovered!\nI must immediately make contact!
Do you have a sense for why you\nseem rare?
You weren’t born in Alola.\nFor some reason, that’s what I think.
Does this area seem like a power spot\nto you?
Aah! My Pokémon didn’t get infused with power!
The Pokémon enshrined at the Ruins...\napparently they purify our impurities.
Ready, set, go!
Game, set!
Congratulations!
My Pokémon is tough as nails!
I’m deflated.\nI’ve lost all heart...
Mienshao is angry!\nIt will reforge my lost heart!
I’ve completed trials and grand trials;\nnow I aim for an even higher place!
Were the trials you completed more densely packed\nthan the ones I did?
I’m literally searching for a high place!\nI’m actually gonna go climb a tree.
Both me and my Pokémon were born in\nthe mountains!
Conflicts produce nothing, but from Pokémon battles springs\na sense of mutual respect.
If a Hiker like me springs from the mountains,\nSwimmers could well spring from a wellspring!
I was a Rising Star who spent all my time in\nbattle, and now I’m a Veteran!
I say I’m a Veteran, but the path of Pokémon runs steep!
If you keep cherishing your Pokémon,\nyou can become a Veteran, too!
I’m not just an ordinary Sightseer!
Whoa! I’ve discovered a cluster of talent\nin the Alola region!
I’m a Sightseer battling to get stronger\nin the battle facilities of each region!
Surely you are able to battle with two\nPokémon at the same time, aren’t you?
We want even stronger rivals!\nMy Pokémon and I both cry out for that!
Thank you for showing the strength I was looking for!\nI’m glad I came to Alola!
That’s right... Battle Towers—and their like in\ndistant regions—are the facilities I favor!
I came all the way to Alola, so I want you to\nshow me two Pokémon!
I know a lot about Pokémon...\nI can use my knowledge in battle!
You know a lot about Pokémon.\nAmazingly, even more than I do!
Completion of the Pokédex is\nthe basis of Pokémon research!\c\nYou should collect a ton of Pokémon\nwith Rotom!
What are Pokémon?\nDo you know?
Why was I unable to win?\nThank you for giving me an assignment!
What are Pokémon?\c\nEveryone will have a different answer, but\nyou can figure it out by thinking about it.
I’m a self-seeking Backpacker!\nI savor each day as it comes.\r\nI guess today will be a battle with you!
This is the taste of defeat...\nPerhaps it’s delicious to savor!
It’s good to be a Backpacker!\c\nYou get to decide on your own all the\nthings you do and don’t want to do!
I battle every day.\nThere’s no one who can match me in that!
Darn! It’s my fault that my Pokémon lose\nso often.
We’re so strong because of marital disputes!\nAhaha!
You want to fight us!\nYou’ve gotta have two Pokémon.
Ohoho! We battle 50 times a day.
The shame from losing will rejuvenate me!
You might say that I raised\nmy husband’s Pokémon!
You want to fight with us, right?\nThen you’ve gotta have two Pokémon.
To be the strongest is an unfulfilled dream...\nbut you must press on to get closer to it!
Whoa! Training!\nI haven’t done enough training!
Even after the island challenge, I still want\nto strengthen myself!\c\nTrainers and Pokémon who feel that way\ngather at the Battle Tree!
To form a battery, my Pokémon and I battle\nconstantly while synchronizing our breathing.
Whoa... You’re legit!
Talonflame is the pitcher and I’m\nthe catcher!\c\nYou may wonder how it throws, but let’s\nnot talk of it!
Let’s have a party.\nA rough-and-tumble Pokémon party!
Your attacks were effective!\nI felt them all the way to my heart!
The party is over!\nLet’s have a party to celebrate that!
I’mma get fired up, naturally!
I got fired up and lost, unfortunately!
It’s the fighting spirit, yo, the fighting spirit!\nZ-Power is fighting spirit, too, right?
We’re aiming for the top, so be prepared for us\nto go all out!
You guys are the tops!\nI felt the strength in your heart!
If you’re aiming for the top, you’ve got\nto test yourself against top opponents!\c\nThe world is simple like that!
A strong Trainer can tell the strength of\nhis or her opponent at a glance!
What amazing Pokémon!\nTruly, I must admit my defeat!
I like Pokémon so much, it actually pains me...\nSo I let all of them shine in battle.
[~ 609]
[~ 610]
[~ 611]
The way you guys trust each other!\nI want to see it all!
Nicely done! I dig it—Pokémon and Trainers who trust\neach other.
You can demonstrate your full strength\nby trusting each other!
The altar is just a little farther, so I can’t\nlet you pass easily.\r\nShow me everything you’ve got!
Whoa, you’ve got a lot...\nI have no choice but to admit defeat!
Go where you please!\c\nIf you and your Pokémon give it everything\nyou’ve got, there’s no place you can’t reach!
Trainers and Pokémon should be\nfree! Freedom is good!
Good stuff!\nBe as free as you can be!
We can’t decide what Pokémon are like!\nThey are free!
Do trial-goers come all the way out here?\nWhat’s the deal with the kids in Alola?
Alola is great!\nYou and your Pokémon are great!
Ah! There are still so many undiscovered\nPokémon in the world!\c\nWhen you finish the island challenge,\nyou should travel the world!
The most dangerous spot in Alola.\c\nAllow me to test whether you can\nget past the Vast Poni Canyon!
Excellent! You guys should be able to reach\nthe altar!
The Altar of Alola concentrates the power of\nthe stars...\r\nThat’s what they say.
You need two Pokémon that can battle!\nThat’s our request to you.
Show me how serious you and your\nPokémon are!
Wonderful! You and your Pokémon should absolutely\nhead to the altar!
The Altar of Alola is a vessel that\ncollects light...\r\nThat’s what they say.
You need two Pokémon that can battle!\nThat’s our request to you.
If you climb mountains, there’s so much\nyou need to know about them—the Pokémon\r\nthat live there and the Trainers you’ll meet!
I went to the top! And you’re the tops!\nThat’s pretty similar!
Totem Pokémon seem to guard the favorite\nplaces of the Tapu—the guardian deities.
I like Pokémon!\c\nI like battling!\c\nI like using moves!\c\nAnd I love winning!
I lost! But my Pokémon that lost are adorable!
I hate losing!\c\nBut falling to the bottom and then struggling\nto climb back up, I can’t get enough of that!
I’ll win! That’s all there is to it.
I lost! That’s all there was to it...\nWell, you guys are terrific.
The hearts of the Pokémon\nand Trainer overlap...\r\nThey seek only victory!\c\nI want to reach that kind of mental state.
Anywhere for the sake of research!\nJust like my idol—Professor Birch.
The skills of Pokémon are needed\nwhen examining places here and there.
If you know Pokémon, you may be able\nto travel here and there without battling.
I confined myself to this cave to seek\nthe secrets of battle.\c\nIf it’s all right with you, please\nbattle my beloved Pokémon!
Attacking and defending, I guess it’s all\nup to oneself.
Adjusting to one’s opponent...\nMaintaining oneself...\c\nBoth are wonderful! What’s important\nis whether something is fitting to oneself.
My outward face is that of a Backpacker.\nWhat about my inward face...?
You guys are strong, so I could not steal\na glorious victory.
I’m a treasure hunter looking for treasure!\c\nHave a whiff of this whole area.\nYou can smell the aroma of treasure!
In this case, I’ll ask you!\nWhat do you think a mountain is?
What strength!\nJust like a mountain!
A mountain is a concept!\nSomething you must overcome is a mountain!
Intruder spotted! I’ll fight with all I have to wipe\nyou out!
What does this mean? What does this mean!
You may think yourselves strong,\nbut Aether Paradise is huge!
I’ll crush you to find out what you’re made of!\nI bet it’s a bunch of stuff, including money!
Oh! Prize money!
There are people with many different faces at\nAether Paradise.
I wanna go back in time and tell myself to not battle you.
It’s not bad to lose! It’s bad to win against me!
I lost, I lost! I’ll give you the money I have!
You don’t have to ring the bell.\nIf our eyes meet, I’ll come.
Having to hand over my pocket\nmoney rather than getting a tip...
Recently, there have been cases of Pokémon\nstaying by themselves...
The first step to surpassing Captain\nMallow is to strengthen my Pokémon!
I lost!\nLet me have another!
Mallow’s food is special.\nIt grips your heart.
Alola, alola! Welcome, Trainer!
Hula, hula!
A lot of people come by holding Eggs,\nso cheer them on with dance!
I’m training together with the genius\nnext to me in order to beat him!
Master! Sorry...
If you’re strong, be just!\nI bow my head to my young partner!
If you only have one Pokémon that can fight,\nplease come back later.
I was born a karate genius!\nI teach moves to my Pokémon.
I keep a smile even when my Pokémon and I lose!\nIt reassures my Pokémon.
Hmm... I’ve got to further devote myself\nto my karate!
If you only have one Pokémon that\ncan fight, I must ask you to leave.
When it comes to golf or Pokémon, it’s all about\nthe performance.
What a miss...\nMy performance was absolutely terrible.
Just getting the ball in the hole...\nit’s fun because it’s so difficult!
The swing is all in the hips!\nI’ll put my hips into it when I take you on!
Even if I can triumph over myself in golf, when it\ncomes to triumphing over my opponent in a match...
Natu’s always jumping around, chasing after my\ngolf balls!
I haven’t had any cases, so I’m bored...\nHow about a battle?
This is a case!\n...Or not.
It’s OK for a Police Officer to be weak\nbecause Alola is peaceful!
Clean, clean! The fighting style of Janitors\nis also clean!
Spotless!
The Pokémon move Recycle allows you to use\nan item you have already used!

Just like flexible bamboo, I’ll evade your attacks!
I messed up my evasion!\nYou and your Pokémon are way too awesome.
Just like flexible bamboo, I also evade work!
Are you aware of the awesomeness of being\nbarefoot over the geothermally warmed ground?
Barefoot! The soles of my feet are hot!
It gets pretty warm if you’re barefoot\nover the geothermally warmed ground!
Welcome to the secret beach!\nLet’s have a battle to get acquainted!
Good work, good work.\nHere’s my pocket money!
My pocket money...never mind how I fetch it.\c\nAnd never mind about items washing ashore\nevery day.
C’mere! Let’s do something\ngood with our Pokémon.
Hey! The fun ends immediately if you’re too strong.
Items wash up on Ula’ula Beach...\c\nIt’s more fun to think of them as the\nhandiwork of Pokémon rather than the tide’s.
I want rare Pokémon!\nI’ll go anywhere due to my tenacity.
You’d be surprised how little I fixate on victory.
My nature as a Collector gives me trouble.\c\nI can’t travel to other islands until I’ve\ncompleted the Ula’ula Island Pokédex.
I’m doing research on the island challenge.\nI ask for your cooperation!
Despite taking damage, I was able to gather data!
Trainers on the island challenge are strong!\nMy research is conclusive!
Argh! I can’t help but want to\nbattle when a Trainer is present!
Argh! No way I’d lose if this were about dancing.
Floette celebrates every beautiful flower garden\nit sees with a dance! I wish I could be like that.
I was watching the parabolic antenna,\nand I found a Trainer!
Wha-wha-wha-what!
I wonder if Pokémon can see microwaves\ntransmitted between parabolic antennae.

I feel sorry for the Pokémon who have to be\nused by an intruder!
Hmph! Although you’re an intruder, you seem to have\na lot of skill!
Is it because you guys arrived? Paradise seems\nso showy!
I must fight to reassure the Pokémon\nin paradise!
That was regrettable... I guess it really is a must\nto have power!
What I heard was that we are to be on the\nlookout for people trying to steal Pokémon.
I was told to turn away Trainers, whomever they\nmight be!
Hey! You’re so strong that there’s\nno way I can turn you away!
That Faba... He doesn’t even try to fight\nby himself!
I sensed the strength that you possess as Champion.
Since you’ve become Champion, both you and\nyour Pokémon have a certain level of polish.
I’m...I’m speechless!\nHow did you do it again?!
This feeling of frustration that is swelling within me...\nI will use it to propel my growth!
It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re\nweak...you know?
Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!
Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!

If you want to see a rainbow, you’ve got to wait for it to\nstop raining.
Yes, yes...
You provide a dazzling battle.
There’s no need for two suns in the sky.

Intense battle is a lot for my old body to bear...
Summer ice is much sought after, but no one even\nglances at winter ice. 
I couldn’t skillfully do what I learned from my grandma!
The bitterness of defeat...I must fully savor that as well.
Yes! It seems that you are once more victorious!
Luvdisc!
Corsola!
Well! You certainly reeled me in.
Sure enough, when it comes to you and Pokémon,\nthe quality of the ingredients shines forth!
...I can’t beat you if I keep my troubles to myself.

I lost. I was extinguished!
My surprise when Remoraid evolved into\nOctillery! The world is full of wonder!
I’m confident in the training I’ve done\nwith my Pokémon! Check it out!
Ahh! Did I not use enough Pokémon Refresh?\nDid I not use enough?
Practice is practice!\nIn the end, you need the will to win.
If you really wanna see what we can do,\nyou’ve gotta have two healthy Pokémon!
Testing out the results of one’s training\nis of the utmost importance!
It’s frustrating to lose in red rover!
You’ve got to go all out in training, too! ’Cause\nthe tension is totally different in a real game.

Me an’ Dedenne aren’t messing around!
What?! But it’s so nuzzle-able!
Whoever yer against, “not messing\naround” means recognizing yer opponent.
Faith moves mountains!
My hopes were crushed!
Is faith needed to speed up one’s techniques?
A weak Trainer blames losses on his or\nher Pokémon!
No way! It’s cool with me, bad dude that I am,\nso let’s go again!
I’m a Punk Guy! I’d be a punk to give up!
Hey! There’s no way you can battle against us\nwith just one Pokémon.
The weather in Alola is too nice, so\nyou get why I wanna get rowdy, right?
Sooo bad!
Don’t call me a Punk Girl.\nThat makes it sound like I’m a bad kid!
Hey! We can’t battle you if you’ve got just\none Pokémon.
I’m an Office Worker!\nOr you could say I’m a business guy!
Hm? Are my partners business Pokémon?
I want to do business with Pokémon.\c\nFor example, I could use the pincers of\nCrabrawler, which grow back constantly.
Here comes a Trainer, lured by\nflower nectar.
An Office Worker standing in a meadow.\nThat could be a painting...
Torkoal’s Flame Wheel sends Jumpluff flying\nbeyond what the eye can see...
I’d go anywhere to be extreme!\nCheck out how us bad dudes do it.
Hmph! Ya may be strong, but there’s nothing good or\nbad about ya!
I’ve gotta praise an opponent who has taken\ntheir favorite fighting style to the extreme!
I wanna beat you down!\nCome back with two healthy Pokémon.
All I can do is get psyched against an opponent\nI can’t beat, even after I’ve trained myself up!
I can’t do anything through my psyched ’tude.\nBut I’ve gotta look cool!
Even if I know I can’t win, I can’t show my uncool\nside to my battling Pokémon, so I psych\r\nmyself up.
I wanna get psyched up!\nJust show me two healthy Pokémon.

Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
Winning even after your Attack stat is lowered...\nAn indomitable spirit, indeed!
The Pokémon and Trainer’s feelings\nare stacked together...\r\nTry receiving the unleashed Z-Power!
The highness of caliber to triumph\nwhile reacting to the feelings of your opponent!
If Pokémon and Trainer boost each other up,\nthe Z-Power unleashed will grow stronger, too!
Also known as the move department store!\c\n...I say that, but Pokémon can only remember\nfour moves at the same time.
Granbull! Sharpedo! Ampharos!
Pokémon that can learn many different moves\ncan, by doing so, deceive the opposing Trainer!
This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!
This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!

Can you live on ideals alone?\nCan you get by on just high-sounding talk?
You guys are dazzling...horribly sparkling...
While competing with Team Skull to\nconserve Pokémon...\r\nsome people become steeped in evil.
Adults face many complex circumstances, right?\nChildren shouldn’t meddle in their affairs.
The children of Alola who aim to be champion through\nthe island challenge—they are not to be underestimated!
You all—you’re a good combination.\nDon’t betray your friends!
OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!
OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!

I’ll crush you, meddler with the Pokémon that\nwere being protected by those serious guys!\r\nThat’s the best entertainment!
Ehh... Guess it’s back to honest Pokémon conservation\nactivities for me.
People in the Alola region treat Pokémon well,\nbut it’s better to make Pokémon fight!
Where there is light, there is shadow! But that’s\nnot it. Light generates shadow!
Losing to you...generated dark feelings in me!
Truly bad people do bad things sneakily.
Let’s see, how do I undo this development?
What is this... Too severe!
When the eyes of Pokémon Trainers meet,\nyou know what’s going to happen, right?\r\nA Pokémon battle!
Oh! Your Pokémon look[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0001)]s so happy that [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0704)]it'sthey've won!
The more you battle other Trainers, the more\npowerful your Pokémon will become!
We call Malie Garden Nugget Garden!\c\nBeat us five Trainers and win a fabulous prize!\c\nThink you got what it takes?
Whoo! Good stuff!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I’m second! Now it’s serious!\n
How could I lose?
I did my best, so I’ve no regrets!
Here’s No. 3! I won’t be easy!
Ow! Stomped flat!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I’m No. 4! Getting tired?
I lost, too!
I did my best, so I’ve no regrets!
OK! I’m No. 5! I’ll stomp you!
Whoa! Too much!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
Arrgh!\nYou are good!
Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
I guess I’m burned out after all...
That’s fighting spirit!
Whee! Whee! It’s a battle...a battle!
Why! I lost!
Hey, Trainer!\c\nWhat’s “throw a ball with the Y Button” mean?\nWhat’s it mean?

Rotom Dex! Cool, cool!\c\nYou become more friendly with Rotom by\ntouching it or answering questions, right?
This result...what’s up with that?!
My swelling feelings...\nthey’ve fallen right to the bottom!
The waves of emotion swell...\nI’m so frustrated with losing that I wanna scream!
Run, run...run away...\nThis is no rendezvous!
I couldn’t get it done...\nDon’t worry about it, my precious Pokémon...
Hunh! I can’t even stand myself right now!
I’m gonna belt out everything inside of me!\nI’ve gotta encourage my Pokémon to keep rocking!

Another defeat...\nI do not understand it!
It seems we’re still not drawing out the full potential of\nour Pokémon...
Do I... Do I understand my Pokémon a little better, now?
Was I... Was I able to draw out the potential of my Pokémon,\nat least a little bit?
Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
Yes! You have emerged victorious!
Well! Once again, you certainly reeled me in.
Not enough dancing!
Sure enough, when it comes to you and Pokémon,\nthe quality of the ingredients shines forth!
I couldn’t get it done...\nDon’t worry about it, my precious Pokémon...

Thud! That’s the sound of your\nstrength rocking me to my core!

I like the sea in any of its moods...\nIt’s always the same ocean, after all.
I have stayed on this island to train both myself\nand my Pokémon... Witness our power!
Have I been left behind by the level of strength in society?!
I asked my disciple to come pick me up using\nSharpedo when I became strong enough, but\r\nI’ve been waiting for quite some time, now...
I’m just a lost Sightseer, always looking for\nmy boyfriend!
I’m just lost in battle, too, always looking for a way to win!
We’re all travelers in life, always looking for\nsomething or other.
Isn’t this a beautiful spot? I can train here in\npeace and calm.
It’s so calming here... I can’t bring out my fighting spirit...
I know, I’ll perfect a style of fighting that lets\nme win even when I don’t want to fight!
Winning at a Pokémon battle is easier than fixing\nmy truck!
...I would have won if I didn’t lose!
Oh, I’ll fix my truck, too... Once I figure out what\nI’m doing!
I’ll fight with all my strength and more, in order\nto protect Aether Paradise!
Well! Facing you, I bet even people who pick on Pokémon\nwill run away!
I don’t know what some of the employees here\ndo. There are so many different people in\r\nAether Paradise, after all.
This is where I proposed to my wife...\nShe’s...been gone for a while, now.
My dear wife... Please, guide my way, like how a lighthouse\nguides a ship!
As a Trainer, it’s up to me to guide my Pokémon.
I’m working to be the best in the world at\nswimming! Help me train!
I need more muscle to swim across all the seas of Alola!
I guess Poliwrath has the best muscles\nfor swimming...
Welcome to my Secret Base! It’s so secret, I bet\nyou don’t even know where it is! I’ll tell you if\r\nyou can beat me!
Waaah! A secret’s a secret, whether I win or lose!
It’s a secret...because we haven’t made it yet!\nEven what kind of Secret Base it’s going to be is\r\na super, super secret!
The Pokémon of one of our guests and my own\nPokémon became friends, so we’re taking a\r\nwalk together.
I...I let our precious guest down...
I think we may be on our way to the\nKanto region...
Alola, Trainer! Alola, Pokémon!
So even the combined power of a fiery Vulpix and a cool\nVulpix couldn’t beat you!
Vulpix and Vulpix. ♪\nEven if they look different between Kanto and\r\nAlola, they’re still friends!
Hey now! It’s dangerous to stand in front of a\nGolfer, Trainer!
Foooooooooooore!
“Fore!” is golf lingo to warn others who are in\nthe flight path of a golf ball! You should watch\r\nout when walking in front of other Trainers, too!
I wanted to go swimming once it rained, but the\nrain isn’t filling it up at all! It’s so annoying!
Oh, the rain... The rain is flowing away...
The rain of Alola... What can it even wash away...
Bonjour! I’m a Team Skull Grunt, back from the\nKalos region!
Hold on, hold on... I’m not used to being tough!
Even in the Kalos region, Ilima was acting all\nhigh and mighty!
My partner utilized hula as part of her\nkarate moves!
I’m all shook up!
There was a Pokémon in distant lands that\nfought gracefully, as if it was dancing. I think it\r\nwas called Hitmontop.
Oh, only one Pokémon? You need a bigger party\nthan that!
Instead of a fish Pokémon, a Trainer appeared!
The Trainer brought me defeat!
If I don’t catch a fish Pokémon, it means I can\nkeep fishing as long as I want!
What’re you looking for, yo?\nThat sounds like Team Skull, doesn’t it?
Are you for real, yo?!
I came all the way from Akala Island, searching\nfor something I lost. The thing is, I completely\r\nforgot what it was I was looking for!
An Exeggutor and an Alolan Exeggutor\nhave met!
Just lookin’ at the Exeggutor makes me happy...
I think the Exeggutor’s Trainer used Attract on\nme, too... ♪
You and I can never meet, so long as you only\nhave one Pokémon in your party.
This Sightseer with a tiny Exeggutor’s been\npestering me nonstop!
I think I heard Exeggutor’s Telepathy!
An Exeggutor that looks down, and an Exeggutor\nthat looks up... Y’know, it may be a good team.
If you want to see our precious Exeggutor, you\nneed to have at least two Pokémon with you!
Hey, hand over your Buginium Z! I don’t care\nwhether you have one or not!
The Buginium Z... Mr. Guzma...
You take care of your Z-Crystals, you hear me?!
Who...who am I? I remember nothing, except that\nI was a Trainer! Maybe if I battle, I’ll recall more!
Thanks to the shock of being defeated, I feel like my memory\nis coming back!
I’m lightly dressed... Maybe I was a Hiker before\nI lost my memories?!
I ended up here in Resolution Cave while\nsearching for more trials.
You appear as a grand trial before us!
The trial called life doesn’t end until you run out\nof energy. You might as well enjoy it!
Captain Kiawe is teaching me how to dance!
Dance, dance. ♪
Dancing with your Pokémon in perfect sync...\nIt’s the best!
Training, training. ♪ Dancing and Pokémon, both\nneed more training. ♪
Round and round, I’m spinning round and round...
Pokémon are actually better at dancing than my\nmom or my teacher!
I was looking for the Poké Ball I threw,\nbut I found a Pokémon Trainer instead!
No Poké Ball, and no victory either!
I’m looking for a Poké Ball I threw from\nSeafolk Village.
The best place to train as a Firefighter is at the\nBattle Tree!
And here I was all fired up to take on the Battle Tree...
As a Firefighter I know one thing! Fire always\nmoves up!
No matter how good you are at surfing, you\ncan’t ride the waves on a stormy sea! Don’t\r\nfight the waves! You’ve gotta ride with them!
Some waves are too big for anyone to ride...
Mantine Surf is something else, too! Watching\npeople be so in tune with Mantine, riding the\r\nwaves as if they’re dancing!
I didn’t realize that there was such a big difference between\nus in how many Trainers we’ve battled!
My stomach, my stomach’s all weak, yo...\nI don’t think I can handle this, yo...
Oh man, I guess that’s that.
Perhaps, somewhere in my heart, I was hoping I would lose...
No! My big bro’s Pokémon...
Wow, it’s fun to have Pokémon battles with people!
Crabrawler is so full of power, it’s practically shining!
I’m feeling it! I’m feeling that special bond!
It’s raining in my heart, too... I wonder, will there be a rainbow\nwhen it lets up...?
...Impressive. I think I can trust you.
Seriously?! You’re way too strong, yo!
[~ 1058]
Agh! You’re too powerful!
[~ 1060]
I lost even though I was so pumped up and\nfull of cheer!
Oooh my...
Hmph! Looks like we burnt out.
My, how vexing to face off against such a\nskilled young child...
I didn’t get to try it out enough!
I hope you enjoyed yourself!
Oh, congratulations! Would you like to order\nanother drink?
Oh, well done, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0503)]sirmadam! You’ll be the Kantonian\nin no time, I’m sure!
Oh, you’re such a tease! I bet I’m not even the\nfirst Trainer you’ve beaten here!
Arrrgh! My authentic, Kanto-style Pokémon!
I hope you enjoyed yourself!
Oh, congratulations! Would you like to order\nanother drink?
Oh, well done, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0503)]sirmadam! You’ll be the Kantonian\nin no time, I’m sure!
Oh, you’re such a tease! I bet I’m not even the\nfirst Trainer you’ve beaten here!
Arrrgh! My authentic, Kanto-style Pokémon!
I’m gonna belt out everything inside of me!\nI’ve gotta encourage my Pokémon to keep rocking!
My fragile heart...broken... My strength...burned up...
Hahaha! You’re good!
If only I had love!
Well, I lost! So, can I still have that scoop?!
Oh, come on now! Do you want me to sulk?
I’ll eventually be the strongest, and it’ll be awesome...\nNah.
Oh, so that’s your strategy? Not bad at all!
Team Rocket has now become...Team Rainbow\nRocket! Witness our reborn strength!
I’ve witnessed your strength! I can’t take any more!
It doesn’t matter how strong you are... Our boss\nis waaaaaaaaaaaaaay stronger!
Oh, what a cute little child! You should go home\nbefore you get hurt!
I guess I should be the one heading home, but I need to figure\nout where home is...
You’ll regret opposing Team Rainbow Rocket!\nYou’ll see!
Do you want to know why we were able to take\nover the foundation so easily...?
I bet you do!
There is a turncoat in the foundation.\c\nThe meaning of “turncoat”?\n...L-look it up yourself!
You can only bow down before our perfect plan!
Our plan... Maybe it’s not so perfect?!
Our boss’s plan is amazing! I don’t really know\nthe details, but it’s definitely amazing!
You haven’t heard it in a while, so... Aiyee!
Here’s an impression for you: Aiyee!
n/a
n/a
n/a
Defeated by a Team Skull punk?!
Even in defeat, we’re still the rainbow!
n/a
n/a
n/a
Red! Blue! Yellow!\nWe’ll show you our rainbow strength!
That’s all I’ve got!
Can you remember the order of the floor panels\nlighting up? If you want to try, press the button\r\nin the middle!
I’m the biggest fan of Muk in all of Team RR!\nYou’ll never get past me!
I really love Muk, but that doesn’t make me a strong\nPokémon Trainer!
The only reason I even decided to participate in\nthis take-over plan is so I could see Alolan Muk!
Yellow, green, blue, blue...
Red, yellow, green, yellow...
I couldn’t keep my promise to the boss...
I guess I’m not getting very far!
Why is nobody following me?!
It was a battle against loneliness!
Everything I do today just doesn’t work out!
Wow, what a downer!
P-please, sir! Get revenge for me!
I wanted to show the newbie how good I was, but...
Not even a single Rattata is getting past me!
Y-you’re too strong! How am I supposed to stop that?!
These arrows on the floor... They never take me\nto where I want to go.
I...I need to use the restroom... But these...these\narrows... They just... Aaaauugh!
Oh, cruel world...
Blasted arrows! They make everything more\ncomplicated than it needs to be...
Do you never get tired?!
What? Do you have a Max Revive for people or something?!
I’ve spotted the intruder before the Meowth\nstatues did!
Meow could you...
Even if you get past me, you’ll never evade the\ngaze of the Meowth! But you’re not allowed to\r\ntouch the back of the Meowth, OK?
Meow meow Meowth!
My plan to ambush you by hiding among the Meowth has\nclearly failed...
Y’know, I wonder why all these security system\nstatues are modeled after Meowth...?
I saw what you were doing—I just couldn’t keep up...
If you turn 360 degrees, you’ll be facing me again!
I fell behind, but only by an inch...
Like I figured...
Impressive.\nYour prowess is notable.
Impressive.\nYour prowess is notable.
I can feel the fire of your convictions burning deep within\nyour heart!
I can feel the fire of your convictions burning deep within\nyour heart!
I couldn’t have been defeated by some random Trainer from\nwho knows where!
I couldn’t have been defeated by some random Trainer from\nwho knows where!
Ha! That was a truly intense fight!
My Pokémon each gave it their best.
Maaasssttteerrr!
Mount Lanakila towers above us all! This is a\nnew joy for Hikers only. I won’t let anyone else\r\ntrample all over this beauty!
A Trainer and Pokémon bigger than...any mountain?!
Now isn’t that something? You’re more of a\nchallenge than Mount Lanakila itself!
Have at you!
Please, let me have a moment with my Pokémon, now that\nthey’re back in their Poké Balls.
I strive to never let myself down... And even\nmore so, to never let my Pokémon down, since\r\nthey fight for me against any odds!
It’s not just Pokémon! We Trainers need to\nevolve, too!
This frustration... This disappointment I feel... This is what will\nhelp me evolve!
The way you battle changes, and the way you\nthink changes, too... That’s how we evolve!
I hear something interesting’s been built, so I\njust had to see it for myself.
The way you and your Pokémon battle—that was definitely\nworth seeing!
The world is fascinating—it’s just full of things\nI’ve never seen before!
We dug the tunnels! We made the path! Now,\nwe’re gonna challenge a challenger!
This challenger is something else! Definitely one that won’t\nbe beaten easily!
It makes me happy to see so many people\npass through Victory Road, which me and my\r\nPokémon worked so hard to complete!
We may be away from our home, but our Fighting\nDojo travels with us! And all are welcome!
I couldn’t even do my sway-back move!
We came all the way from the Kanto region, but\nI think we’re better off heading back to\r\nSaffron City.
You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
Two Black Belts at once! This is going to be a\nhead-on battle, you understand?
A head-on battle...and we lost...?
We thought that if we could become the best in\nthe Alola region, we’d get more students...
You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
Osu! The guy next to me says “osu,” too!
How frustrating! The guy next to me feels frustrated, too!
Osu! It means to push forward, in spite of\ndifficulties and setbacks!
You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
Put your strength into the area below your\nbelly button!
I’m losing my strength...
Take deep breaths before a big endeavor!\nYou must always remain calm!
You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
I keep losing, but I think this next battle I’m\ngonna win!
Agh... Another loss! Another defeat! A fail of\nepic proportions!
If you keep losing, and losing, and losing, you\ncan keep believing that you’ll win next time!\c\nThat’s why I keep challenging people to battles!
Just having a Z-Power Ring or Z-Crystals\ndoesn’t mean anything—the power they hold\r\nmeans nothing unless you use it!
You... It seems like you know the strength of the power you\nhold, and its dangers, too.
Just being together with your Pokémon won’t\nhelp you win, either. You need to understand\r\neach other!
All my Pokémon! All my luggage! I’ve got my\nPoké Balls, my backpack, both full of dreams!
You’re full of strength, and we fully admit defeat!
My heart’s full of memories, too, y’know! And\nthey include my battle with you now!
My desire knows no bounds! I want both victory\nand all the Pokémon!
The victory I so desired is now beyond my grasp...
Not being able to get something only makes me\nwant it more!
I never stop honing my skills as an ace!
My skills as an ace...they meant nothing against you!
You carry on ahead! We will continue to hone\nour skills and will surpass you someday!
Only one partner?! Impressive, but you need at\nleast two Pokémon if you want to face us!
My skills as a Veteran have not dwindled!
My skills as a Veteran were not enough against you, eh...
You should move on ahead! We will train more\nand will catch up with you someday!
Only one partner?! Impressive, but you need at\nleast two Pokémon if you want to face us!
Battō!
Men! Kote! Do! Tsuki!
Ippon!
Tachi-ai!
Tsuba-zeriai!
Maitta!
Do you think you’re smart enough to navigate\nthis warp panel labyrinth?!
It looks like the only one lost...is me!
If you’re lost, defeating me won’t help with that,\nyou know.
Hah! If I capture you, I’m up for a promotion!
I couldn’t seize you, or my chance for a promotion!
Oh well, better luck with the next intruder,\nI guess!
You poor, little, lost Mareep! I’ll take good care\nof you!
What are you, a Gyarados in Mareep’s clothing?!
You want to get back to the entrance?\nJust jump into one out of the two!
Welcome to a dead end!
It’s not my fault you’re not getting anywhere!
Don’t think too much about why I might be\nguarding a dead end...
You there! Identify yourself!
Such power...
You were strong enough to defeat my Raticate...\nHeh, very well. You’re worthy!
I won’t go easy on you, just because you’re a\nkid! It’s time you learned to fear adults!
Who said age mattered, anyway?!
Hey, we adults are doing our best, too, y’know!\nGo easy on us!
Your bad luck to wander into my territory!
Well, lucky you!
I only signed up for Team RR because I was told\nrainbow color was my lucky color!
I’ll do anything to help our boss!
Man, I feel so useless...
Hey, were the guys in charge of being the wall\nuseful for the boss, at least?
Your relentless advance stops here!
...Or maybe it doesn’t!
Relentless means to never relent!
You got past the first floor?! Right, I need to\nstop you right here!
You’re unstoppable!
Well, at least I stalled you a little bit!\nWhat a joke!
Alola, trial-goer!\nHave you never seen a Surfer before?
I’ll ride waves even if I’m not feelin’ it! That’s what Surfers do,\nafter all!
I prefer riding waves with just my board, but I\ngotta say that Mantine Surf looks cool, too!
Even if I can’t surf well, that doesn’t stop me\nfrom enjoying Pokémon battles!
Even if I lose the Pokémon battle...I can still surf!
I try to enjoy Pokémon battles when I can’t surf\nwell, and I go surfing when I get beaten in battle!\r\nThat way, I can have fun 24 hours a day!
Who have you met, and what did you choose?
No doubt about it! You chose Pokémon, didn’t you?
I met my Pokémon, but I also met my surfboard.\nAnd I ended up choosing both!
Ha! That was a truly intense fight!
Such a strange feeling...\nI feel somehow proud, despite being defeated.
I don’t understand!
Fighting together with your Pokémon...\nIt is not something we had considered ourselves.
You’re a tough one, I’ll give ya that! I have fun battlin’ you,\neven if I can’t beat you down!
I sensed the strength that you possess as Champion.
I’m gonna belt out everything inside of me!\nI’ve gotta encourage my Pokémon to keep rocking!
You got a piece of me!\nAnd I guess I shouldn’t have messed with you...
You had me dancing to your tune, all right!
So I have failed to understand Poipole!
It is not Poipole that failed in this battle.\nIt is I, as a Trainer, who have failed...
You’ll have to bring more Pokémon if you want\nto dance!
If you want to practice dancing with us, you\nneed at least two Pokémon!
Why don’t we battle two Pokémon at a time?
Hello there, Trainer! Oh, you only have one\nPokémon ready for battle?

Perhaps because it would like to grow up\nquickly, it has a voracious appetite, eating\na hundred leaves a day.
Its shell is filled with a thick liquid. All of the\ncells throughout its body are being rebuilt in\npreparation for evolution.
Its wings are covered in toxic scales. If it finds\nbird Pokémon going after Caterpie, Butterfree\nsprinkles its scales on them to drive them off.






Its incisors grow continuously throughout its life.\nIf its incisors get too long, this Pokémon\nbecomes unable to eat, and it starves to death.
People say that it fled from its enemies by\nusing its small webbed hind feet to swim\nfrom island to island in Alola.
Its reckless nature leads it to stand up to\nothers—even large Pokémon—if it has to protect\nits territory.
Carrying food through Fearow’s territory is\ndangerous. It will snatch the food away from\nyou in a flash!
By dislocating its jaw, it can swallow prey larger\nthan itself. After a meal, it curls up and rests.
The latest research has determined that there\nare over 20 possible arrangements of the\npatterns on its stomach.
Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests\nwhere nests of Pikachu live are dangerous,\nsince the trees are so often struck by lightning.
As electricity builds up inside its body, it\nbecomes more aggressive. One theory is that\nthe electricity buildup is actually causing stress.
It lives in areas of limited rainfall. When danger\napproaches, it curls up into a ball to protect its\nsoft stomach.
Its claws and horns often break off. The broken\nclaws and horns can be used to carve plows for\ntilling farm fields.






They’re popular, but they’re rare. Trainers who\nshow them off recklessly may be targeted\nby thieves.
It can’t help but hear a pin drop from over half\na mile away, so it lives deep in the mountains\nwhere there aren’t many people or Pokémon.
Its beautiful tails have made it very popular.\nHowever, if it’s not brushed diligently, it will\nbe a mass of tangles before you know it.
It is vindictive and relentless by nature.\nThose who cross it even once will be cursed for\na thousand years, along with their descendants.

Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it\nnormally passes the time spacing out and doing\nas little as possible.
Even fast-swimming fish Pokémon can be\ndisabled by Golduck. It brings them to a\nstandstill and seizes them.
The smallest of things could cause it to lose its\ntemper. Because it doesn’t hold in its stress,\nthis Pokémon can live a long time.
It will never forgive opponents who have\nangered it. Even after it has beaten them down\nuntil they can’t move, it never ever forgives.

It has always been supposed that Seel live only\nin cold seas. Their having shown up in Alola is\na mystery.
It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight\nknots, searching for Pokémon that will become\nits prey. It’s especially fond of Wishiwashi.
It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a\nsterile environment, the germs within its body\ncan’t multiply, and it dies.

This Pokémon was created using the\ncutting-edge science of 20 years ago, so\nmany parts of it have since become obsolete.

Its two antennae glow softly to lure in prey,\nmaking it a useful Pokémon for night fishing.

When it examines things, before touching them\nwith its hands, it makes lip contact and then\ndiligently licks all the dirt off its lips.
When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid’s\nmood improves. It can be useful to record that\nsound and play it when Elekid’s feeling down.
When flames drip from its nose, that means it\nhas a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in\nsome magma.
It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The\nhigher the quality of the pastures it lives in,\nthe richer and tastier its milk becomes.
