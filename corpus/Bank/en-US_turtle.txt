Welcome, and thanks for using Pokémon Bank!\c\nI’m Brigette. I’m the one who developed Pokémon Bank.
Pokémon Bank is just what it sounds like: a place where\nyou can deposit your Pokémon and keep them safe.\c\nThe Pokémon that you deposit here can be withdrawn\nagain anytime, too.\c\nBut if you try to deposit any Pokémon holding items,\nI’ll remove the items and send them to your Bag, got it?\c\nSpecial alert! If your Bag happens to be full when\nI try to send an item to it, your item will disappear!\nSo be careful when you’re depositing Pokémon, OK?
Do you know how many Pokémon you can store in\nPokémon Bank? The answer is 3,000 Pokémon!\nI know—it’s amazing, right?\c\nNow give me just a moment, and I’ll get Pokémon Bank\nall ready for you to use.

Wigglytuff’s body is very flexible. By inhaling deeply,\nthis Pokémon can inflate itself seemingly without end.\nOnce inflated, Wigglytuff bounces along lightly like a balloon.

Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks\nthe victim’s blood. It becomes active on inky dark\nmoonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon.
Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself.\nDuring the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon’s feet\nare thought to change shape and become similar to the roots\nof trees.
From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely\nhorrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the\nnoxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey.
Vileplume has the world’s largest petals. They are used to\nattract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the\nprey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them.

Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body.\nAs a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two\ntriplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak\nabout without making any incriminating footsteps. For some\nreason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.
Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness.\nThe whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the\nPokémon’s surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed\nby the whiskers.
If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can’t remember\nhaving done so. It apparently can’t form a memory of such\nan event because it goes into an altered state that is much\nlike deep sleep.
Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims\neffortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues\npeople from wrecked ships floundering in high seas.
When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns\nrough, it’s a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However,\nbecause it goes into a towering rage almost instantly,\nit is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.

The surface of Poliwhirl’s body is always wet and slick with\na slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily\nslip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.
Poliwrath’s highly developed, brawny muscles never grow\nfatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong,\nthis Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean\nwithout effort.
Abra needs to sleep for eighteen hours a day. If it doesn’t,\nthis Pokémon loses its ability to use telekinetic powers. If it is\nattacked, Abra escapes using Teleport while it is still sleeping.

When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the\nground. It will not awaken even if hikers step on it unwittingly.\nIn the morning, this Pokémon rolls downhill in search of food.
Rocks are Graveler’s favorite food. This Pokémon will climb a\nmountain from the base to the summit, crunchingly feasting on\nrocks all the while. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls back down\nto the bottom.

Slowbro’s tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite.\nAs a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This\ncauses Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead.
Magnemite floats in the air by emitting electromagnetic waves\nfrom the units at its sides. These waves block gravity. This\nPokémon becomes incapable of flight if its internal electrical\nsupply is depleted.
Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to\nelectronics and precision instruments. Because of this, it is\nsaid that some towns warn people to keep this Pokémon\ninside a Poké Ball.

Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it\nnormally passes the time spacing out and doing\nas little as possible.
Even fast-swimming fish Pokémon can be\ndisabled by Golduck. It brings them to a\nstandstill and seizes them.
The smallest of things could cause it to lose its\ntemper. Because it doesn’t hold in its stress,\nthis Pokémon can live a long time.
It will never forgive opponents who have\nangered it. Even after it has beaten them down\nuntil they can’t move, it never ever forgives.

Delicate equipment can malfunction in areas\ninhabited by Magneton, which send out\nmysterious electrical signals.



It has always been supposed that Seel live only\nin cold seas. Their having shown up in Alola is\na mystery.
It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight\nknots, searching for Pokémon that will become\nits prey. It’s especially fond of Wishiwashi.
It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a\nsterile environment, the germs within its body\ncan’t multiply, and it dies.

While it can transform into anything, each Ditto\napparently has its own strengths and\nweaknesses when it comes to transformations.

Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat. When\nit’s about to be attacked by an invading enemy,\nit dives into the water to hide.

This Pokémon was created using the\ncutting-edge science of 20 years ago, so\nmany parts of it have since become obsolete.

Its two antennae glow softly to lure in prey,\nmaking it a useful Pokémon for night fishing.

It’s said that while this Pokémon has the power\nto predict the future, it’s not powerful enough\nto change the future it sees.
Clothing made from Mareep’s fleece is easily\ncharged with static electricity, so a special\nprocess is used on it.

The light from its tail can be seen from space.\nThis is why you can always tell exactly where it\nis, which is why it usually keeps the light off.

When it examines things, before touching them\nwith its hands, it makes lip contact and then\ndiligently licks all the dirt off its lips.
When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid’s\nmood improves. It can be useful to record that\nsound and play it when Elekid’s feeling down.
When flames drip from its nose, that means it\nhas a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in\nsome magma.
It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The\nhigher the quality of the pastures it lives in,\nthe richer and tastier its milk becomes.

It moves less than an inch a year, but when\nit’s in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the\nground in a split second.
