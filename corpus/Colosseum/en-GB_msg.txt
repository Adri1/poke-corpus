Hi, it's NETT.\nI analyzed the SHADOW POKéMON\nLIST again and discovered\nsix more.\nThe additions are NOCTOWL,\nFLAAFFY, HOUNDOOM, SHUCKLE,\nMILTANK, and DELIBIRD.\nI'll be in contact.
It's BITT in THE UNDER.\n[Player], I caught you on film\nin an unbelievable scene that's\nterrible and shocking.\nWhat's your problem?\nWhy are you attacking people\nwith a SHADOW TOGETIC?
Hi, it's NETT.\nI analyzed the SHADOW POKéMON\nLIST some more and discovered\nthe very last one.\nThe last SHADOW POKéMON was\nTOGETIC!\nThat completes the analysis of\nthe data ROM you provided!

[speechbubble]: Oh, so you must be here to watch\nthe battles.\nIt's great to see some awesome\nPOKéMON moves in a live setting.\c[speechbubble]: The winner gets cash and a TM,\nwhich is short for TECHNICAL MACHINE.\nA TM is used for teaching a move to\na POKéMON, so it's important.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Welcome to PHENAC STADIUM.\c[speechbubble]: This is where we register trainers\nfor challenges.\c[speechbubble]: However, the current challenge\nhas already started.\nSo, we are no longer accepting trainers\nfor this challenge.\c[speechbubble]: Please come back and enter the next\nchallenge.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Um... I...\nI really look up to JUSTY, the LEADER\nof the PRE GYM.\c[speechbubble]: He's really cool!\nOf course, he's really a tough trainer\nat POKéMON battles, too![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I saw a bunch of scary-looking\npeople going towards the MAYOR's\nhouse.\c[speechbubble]: But it won't matter if those guys\ndo something bad.\c[speechbubble]: I'm sure JUSTY won't let them get\naway with anything![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Good! Way to dodge that!\nGood going, NOSEPASS![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: There was some ruckus going on\nnear the town's entrance earlier.\c[speechbubble]: It'd better not be the goons again\nfrom the next town over.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What? What?\nIs something serious going on?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I don't think the thugs of PYRITE\nhave shown up here since the last time.\c[speechbubble]: I guess maybe the MAYOR did\nsomething about them.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Let's see...\nAll POKéMON have types and abilities.\nThe combinations of those elements\naffect the balance of power in battle.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I don't have a POKéMON of my own\nyet, but I come here every day.\c[speechbubble]: They have all sorts of POKéMON\nmerchandise here.\nIt's fun to just look, even![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Gwaaaah!\nGreat!\nYou're great!\c[speechbubble]: Watching you battle pumped me up!\nThat was thrilling![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Huh?\nYou're going to battle JUSTY?\nYou don't stand a chance![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Gwaaah!\nGreat!\nYou're great!\c[speechbubble]: You kept me pumped with thrills\nthe whole time!\nIt makes me want to battle, too![dialogue_end]

BOTAN: I'm going to toughen up some\nmore.\nI hope you keep working, too![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That TEAM SNAGEM doesn't frighten\nme.\c[speechbubble]: After all, where those people are\nis far away from here.\nThey wouldn't come out here.\c[speechbubble]: The thugs of PYRITE TOWN...\nThey're much more frightening to me.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ruri rurii.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hi, listen.\nYou saw the news, didn't you?\c[speechbubble]: If PYRITE TOWN is made peaceful,\nit must mean that their thugs won't\nbe coming here anymore.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah, you must be travelers!\nWelcome to PHENAC CITY!\nI am ES CADE, the MAYOR.\cES CADE: Now, you wanted to see me.\nIs there something that I may be \nable to assist you with?[dialogue_end]
ES CADE: Oh? What may I do for\na pretty young lady like you?[dialogue_end]
ES CADE: Saw it?\nAnd what did you see?[dialogue_end]
ES CADE: O-o-o-oh, my!\nPOKéMON like a fighting machine?\nAnd it attacks people?!\cES CADE: Now, if that were true, that\nwould be truly frightening.\nHowever, it is a little hard to believe.[dialogue_end]
ES CADE: Hmm... I see.\nI understand.\nI will order an investigation at once.[dialogue_end]
ES CADE: Oh, no, no.\nThere is no need for thanks.\cES CADE: We mustn't allow thugs to\ndo as they wish.\nEspecially thugs that endanger a pretty\nyoung lady like you!\cES CADE: I'll ask that you give me\na little time on this matter.\nI promise we will get some useful\ninformation for you.[dialogue_end]
ES CADE: Oh, yes.[dialogue_end]
ES CADE: I promise you, we will obtain\nuseful information about those sinister\nPOKéMON.\cES CADE: While we do so, I heartily\nrecommend that you visit our STADIUM,\nthe symbol of our civic pride![dialogue_end]
ES CADE: Ah, it's you two!\nI'm so glad to see that you're safe![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Gaow! Gaow![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That PC can be used not only to\nsave your progress, but also to\naccess the POKéMON STORAGE\nSYSTEM.\c[speechbubble]: Things sure have become easy and\nconvenient!\nFwohohoho.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: An ANTIDOTE cures a poisoning.\nPARLYZ HEAL cures paralysis.\nAnd AWAKENING wakes a POKéMON\nfrom sleep.\c[speechbubble]: But if your POKéMON falls asleep in\na battle, just call out its name.\nThat will wake it up.\nIt doesn't get cheaper than free![dialogue_end]
ES CADE: I have heard.\nThe thugs from our neighboring town\ncame here, even going so far as\nentering my own home!\cES CADE: They did this deliberately\nwhile I was away.\nHow dare them!\cES CADE: We must step up and speed\nalong our investigation![dialogue_end]
ES CADE: I will continue with our\ninvestigation.\nWhatever you do, please take care![dialogue_end]
ES CADE: Ah, it's you two!\nI'm so glad to see that you're safe!\cES CADE: I can tell from the news\nthat you two have been very busy.\nI think it's splendid!\cES CADE: I will continue with our\ninvestigation.\nYou can count on us![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: [Player], go for it!\nI'll be right here, cheering![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What fine weather this is!\nIt's truly a perfect sort of day for\na POKéMON battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, young one, how about\nindulging this old man?\nLet us battle.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh? How boring.\nYou young people today...\nYou have no gumption, I say.[dialogue_end]
DRIG: Whoa!\nI've got to concede this one, lad![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]We've just received breaking news.\cAccording to the arrested SNAGEM\nmember, the smaller SNAG MACHINE\nis compact enough to be carried by\na single person.\cWearing this machine transforms\nordinary POKé BALLS into SNAG\nBALLS.\cA SNAG BALL is an alarming device.\nIt can actually steal POKéMON\nfrom their trainers!\cIt is hoped that the missing SNAGEM\nMACHINE will not be used for criminal\npurposes again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, [Player]!\nWe've finally found you!\nYou filthy, double-crossing traitor!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wrecking the HIDEOUT wasn't\ngood enough for you?!\nSo you rip off the SNAG MACHINE?\nYou've got some nerve![dialogue_end]
DRIG: Ah, yes.\nYou're young, but you've got a bit\nof spine!\cDRIG: Why, you're just like me when\nI was young!\nWell done, indeed![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]We have received breaking news.\cMIROR B., the brutal crime lord of\nPYRITE TOWN, has been defeated and\ndriven out of town.\cReports claim that two young people\nwere behind MIROR B.'s downfall.\nTheir identities and where they\ncame from are unknown.\cThanks to their heroic work, PYRITE\nTOWN should hopefully return to its\npeaceful ways.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's right, pretty lady!\nHe's from TEAM SNAGEM, just like us!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But he's no ordinary member.\nHe's a SNAGGER.\nHe's the best in TEAM SNAGEM at\nSnagging POKéMON without fail![dialogue_end]
DRIG: You really are just like me when\nI was young.\nYou must break a lot of hearts![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you blabbermouth!\nKeep that stuff secret![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Creeps?\nWhat do you mean by creeps?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Gah, this is getting us nowhere!\nIf you won't give it up willingly, we'll\ntake it back by force![dialogue_end]
WAKIN: Wha... Stop that!\nQuit screaming!\nI said quit it![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What, what?!\nWhat's going on out here?![dialogue_end]
WAKIN: No!\nI'm not good enough?![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Gah! This is tied good and tight.\nCan you believe those people?\nWhat a horrible thing to do![dialogue_end]
WAKIN: Blast you, [Player]!\nDon't think this is over!\cWAKIN: We're going to get that SNAG\nMACHINE back.\nJust you wait![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Can you give this rope a tug from\nthe other side?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: The way he battled those goons,\nit was truly superb.\nI wish you could've seen it.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: A peculiar POKéMON?\nNo, they looked ordinary to me.\nWhat do you mean by peculiar\nPOKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hi!\nDid you know?!
[speechbubble]: Hi!\nDid you know?!
[speechbubble]: You know, you two make one\nattractive couple!\nIt makes me a little envious.\nAhahaha![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Isn't it terrifying?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: My, you're awfully calm!\nThey tell me that TEAM SNAGEM\nappeared here a little while ago!\c[speechbubble]: That's terrifying!\nI must be careful!\nI mustn't let them steal away my\nprecious POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hello!\nAre you travelers?\nDon't you think PHENAC CITY is a very\nnice place?\c[speechbubble]: But if you're thinking about going\non, you should be careful.\c[speechbubble]: There is a town called PYRITE ahead.\nThat place is filled with thugs and other\nnasty people.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hiya!\nIf it's not the good-looking couple\nfrom earlier!\c[speechbubble]: So, what's up?\nDid you manage to find anything out?
[speechbubble]: Hi!\nDid you know?!
[speechbubble]: Is that right!\nWell, that's great, then!\nAhahaha![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Isn't it amazing![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Is that right.\nThat's got to be vexing.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: How could you be so...\nSo laid-back?\nPYRITE TOWN's MIROR B. apparently\nwas defeated!\c[speechbubble]: Why, I would be honored to meet\nthe great trainer who must have done\nthe amazing deed![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: If you're still traveling, you should\nstock up on supplies at the shop there.\c[speechbubble]: I recommend it.\nAfter all, it's my hou...\nEr... Ahem!\c[speechbubble]: Uh... Well, anyway, that shop has\nthe best reputation around these parts![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Yes, sir, this shop's the best!\nFriendly service and a great selection!\nI wouldn't do my shopping anywhere\nelse...\c[speechbubble]: Oh, wait a second.\nI've met you before, haven't I?\nEhehehe...[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: If your POKéMON's hurt and\nweakened, you should use a POTION\non it.\c[speechbubble]: Every trainer should be carrying\nat least a POTION or two.\c[speechbubble]: It's not as if there's always going\nto be a POKéMON CENTER when you\nneed one.\nThat's why a POTION comes in handy.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Huh? POKé BALLS?\nCome to think of it, I haven't seen any\nbeing sold in this town.\c[speechbubble]: Oh, wait...\nI think I heard someone saying that\nthey sell POKé BALLS at the OUTSKIRT\nSTAND.\c[speechbubble]: It's east from here, PHENAC.\nIt's modeled after a locomotive,\nso you won't have any trouble finding\nit, I think.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: If your POKéMON's hurt and\nweakened, you should use a POTION\non it.\c[speechbubble]: Every trainer should be carrying\nat least a POTION or two.\c[speechbubble]: It's not as if there's always going\nto be a POKéMON CENTER when you\nneed one.\nThat's why a POTION comes in handy.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hey, you two!\nThere's serious trouble!\nThose thugs came back with help!\c[speechbubble]: I think they went off towards what\nwe call the PRE GYM![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This town's been the very picture\nof peace, but now the mood is\ntense and nervous.\c[speechbubble]: There must be something terrible\nafoot.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, hi, it's the good-looking couple!\nYou know, you're looking even better\ntogether.\nAhahaha![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Now, pay attention.\nOne does not become a good trainer\nsimply by battling without strategy.\c[speechbubble]: A good trainer always thinks about\nthe POKéMON that are in battle.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Here you go.\nI've upgraded it and added the\nSTRATEGY MEMO function.\c[speechbubble]: You'll be able to check the types\nand abilities of the POKéMON you've\nmet at a glance.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your challenge is accepted.\nI do hope you're ready.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Come see me whenever you like.\nI'll update your P★DA with detailed\ndata on the POKéMON you've met.\c[speechbubble]: I hope you make good use of the\nSTRATEGY MEMO as you aim to\nbe a great trainer![dialogue_end]
GWIN: I must commend you for a battle\nwell played.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Now, pay attention.\nOne does not become a good trainer\nsimply by battling without strategy.\c[speechbubble]: A good trainer always thinks about\nthe POKéMON that are in battle.[dialogue_end]
GWIN: My battling style must have been\ntoo sophisticated for you.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, I guess you met a new POKéMON\nor so.\nLet's update your data.\c[speechbubble]: Okay. Here you go.\nI hope you'll study it carefully.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh?\nI guess you haven't met any new\nPOKéMON since the last time.\c[speechbubble]: Come see me whenever you like.\nI'll update your P★DA with detailed\ndata on the POKéMON you've met.\c[speechbubble]: I hope you make good use of the\nSTRATEGY MEMO as you aim to\nbe a great trainer![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: How much can you open your heart\nto your POKéMON, and understand\nand trust one another...\nThat's absolutely basic.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: You're awfully strong!\nI think you would find it easy to become\na teacher here.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Okay, pay attention.\nDuring a battle, always be sure to\ncheck the condition of all the battling\nPOKéMON...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My turn now!\nI'm not going to end up like FOLLY![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Player] showed the P★DA.[dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: Wh-What?!\nMy POKéMON?![dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: Darn it, but you're good!\nYou Snagged my POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hey, what are you doing?\nGet a grip, man![dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: Darn it, but you're good!\nYou knocked out my POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, drat!\nDid that punk there hear all that?![dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: What do we do?\nWhat is there to do?\cTRUDLY: Run away![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Since you overheard us, we don't\nhave any choice.\nBlame it on your own bad luck![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My turn now!\nI'm not going to end up like FOLLY![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Uh... Hey?\nWhere did it DIG to?\nWhere'd my SANDSLASH go?\c[speechbubble]: Come on, boy!\nCome on out!\nPlease![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Heh.\nYou again?\nYou haven't learned any lessons now,\nhave you?\cFOLLY: Well, fine.\nI'll take you on as often as you dare![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Gaah!\nYou're tougher than you look![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: You took out my WHISMUR...\nYou're no ordinary trainer, are you?!\cFOLLY: Huh? Wait a sec...\nThat face...\nMight you be...\nTEAM SNAGEM's...[dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Wha... You dingbat!\nDon't shoot off your mouth![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Don't get all happy just on\naccount of winning this once.\cFOLLY: The next time we meet, I'll trash\nyou, your POKéMON, and all![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: When you get into a POKéMON battle,\nthink about their order.\nIt's important to think about which one\nshould come out first and so on.\c[speechbubble]: When you carry more POKéMON with\nyou, you should pay attention to their\nordering.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hey?\nAre you maybe a really famous trainer?\c[speechbubble]: No offense to my teachers, but\nI learned a lot more from you than\nanything I learned in class.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Who cares about class at a time\nlike this?\nRemember, I'll be rooting for you!\nGo get 'em![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Sure it's important to study in\na classroom.\nBut I learn a lot more from watching\nbattles![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: There's been nothing but news\nabout TEAM SNAGEM on every channel\nall day long.\c[speechbubble]: Usually, they'd have at least one\nchannel showing anime or something.\nGrumble...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bisha! Bishaa![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Nothing's changed on TV.\nIt's still only news about TEAM\nSNAGEM on every channel.\c[speechbubble]: Grumble...\nMan, I'm willing to watch anything.\nMake it a movie, a drama... I don't care\nhow boring as long as it's not the news![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Now every channel's only got news\nabout MIROR B.\c[speechbubble]: Grumble...\nI wish they'd show COLOSSEUM battles\nlive or something...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Awwww, boo!\nI keep getting figures that I don't want!\c[speechbubble]: Darn!\nThe one I want's under that capsule![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This town was peaceful before,\nbut lately, it's been turning rougher.\c[speechbubble]: It's because of the thugs that live\nin PYRITE TOWN, which is the next town\nover.\nThey've been showing up here.\c[speechbubble]: I don't want to have anything to do\nwith them.\nLet sleeping dogs lie; that's what\nI say![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This city used to be peaceful before.\nBut ever since the new MAYOR took\noffice, it's become rougher little\nby little.\c[speechbubble]: You see, the thugs of PYRITE TOWN\nstarted appearing here more and more\noften.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Leave WATER-type battling to me!\nI'll teach you just how strong the WATER\ntype can be.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: JUSTY is strong. Period.\nHe's my teacher, after all.[dialogue_end]
LIQUI: I was impressed by your\nPOKéMON![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I knew that you were strong, but you\ncame out on top even against JUSTY...\nThat's just too much![dialogue_end]
LIQUI: My goal is to become the\nultimate WATER-type battler.\nBack to more training for me![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Player] obtained a WHITE HERB![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: A long time ago, this area was\nbarren of life.\nNeither people nor POKéMON could\nlive on this blighted land.\c[speechbubble]: It was the MAYOR's grandfather,\nthe first MAYOR, who founded PHENAC\nby drawing water to this parched land.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Player] obtained TM27![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: [Player], go for it!\nI'll be rooting for you![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Excellent!\nDon't forget that timing.\nThat's going to make us surefire\nwinners![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, hi.\nAren't you a cute guy?\c[speechbubble]: Giggle...\nIt must be nice to travel with a cute\ngirlfriend.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: It sounds like there's a lot of people\ngathering in the suite downstairs.\c[speechbubble]: If they're going to have a party,\nI want to be invited, too, sweetie.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, hi, lovebirds.\nAnd how are you doing?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sorry to break it to you, but\nI'm not about to let you pass.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Or do you have this idea that\nyou can take me in a battle?
BLUNO: Y-You... You're tough!\nTRUDLY and FOLLY can't be blamed for\nlosing![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is it you?\nDid you want to battle me?\nYou don't look like a trainer...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, it doesn't matter.\nYou can learn how a proper trainer\nbattles from me![dialogue_end]
DUGO: You're tough, even though you\ndon't look it![dialogue_end]
DUGO: The way you battle is...\nUh... Interesting.\nYou might say it's unique, or maybe\nit's just chaotic.\cDUGO: Well, I'll wish you the best of\nluck![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This is a training center.\c[speechbubble]: It has a variety of terrain, so any kind\nof POKéMON can train where they're\nmost comfortable.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]This is a repeat of an earlier\nnews story.\cA TEAM SNAGEM member was arrested\nafter being found hiding in ECLO\nCANYON after the SNAGEM HIDEOUT\nexplosion.\cDuring interrogation, the SNAGEM\nmember revealed that the explosion\nresulted from a clash between SNAGEM\nmembers.\cThe explosion apparently destroyed\nthe SNAG MACHINE used for stealing\nPOKéMON. However, it is said that only\nthe large SNAG MACHINE was destroyed.\cThe small, portable SNAG MACHINE\nappears to have been taken by the\nTEAM SNAGEM member who blew up\nthe SNAGEM HIDEOUT.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This is a training center.\c[speechbubble]: Wha--? Whoa!\nYou're challenging JUSTY?\nThis should be a doozy![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This is a training center.\c[speechbubble]: Wha--? Whoa!\nYou beat JUSTY?\nThat's astounding![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm no good at schoolwork,\nbut I'm pretty hot stuff at POKéMON\nbattles.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're a trainer, too, aren't you?\nLet's duke it out!\nLet's battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nHere we come, and there's no holding\nback![dialogue_end]
KAIB: Ouch, no!\nThat wasn't supposed to happen![dialogue_end]
KAIB: I didn't think I'd lose.\cKAIB: Big guy, you're tough.\nI want you to have this since you're\nso good.[dialogue_end]
KAIB: I'm no good at school...\nAnd no good at battling...\nI'm not good at anything![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hello!\nI'm JUSTY.\nI'm in charge of running the PRE GYM.\cJUSTY: Judging by your appearance,\nI'd say that you're traveling, the two\nof you.\cJUSTY: Well, what do you think?\nSince you're already here, do you feel\nlike having a battle?
JUSTY: Ahahaha!\nThere's no need for you to be shy!\nYou're not imposing on me!\cJUSTY: Hey, you're already here.\nYou should try battling our trainers.
KAIB: Hi, big guy!\nDo you think TEAM SNAGEM is cool?
JUSTY: Okay.\nThen let me introduce you to the\ntrainers of PRE GYM.[dialogue_end]
KAIB: Hmmm...\nI wonder about that...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hi!\nWelcome to PRE GYM!\c[speechbubble]: This is a place for trainers and\nPOKéMON to not only sharpen their\nstrength and skills, but also their\nbody and spirit.[dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Looks like you're ready.\nWell, let's get this started.\cJUSTY: In all, you'll be facing four\ntrainers. They're all a handful, I can\nvouch for that.\cJUSTY: And now, this is where your\nopponent enters![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sorry to break it to you, but\nI'm not about to let you pass.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Or do you have this idea that\nyou can take me in a battle?
JUSTY: So, what's your plan?\nDo you keep chugging on with your\nbattle challenge?
[speechbubble]: Oh.\nYou've already beaten [unknown_2F].\nBut you're quitting anyway.\c[speechbubble]: You must be a very cautious type.[dialogue_end]
ROSSO: Y-You... You're tough!\nTRUDLY and FOLLY can't be blamed for\nlosing![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Okay, gotcha!\nLet's get the next battle started![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Congratulations!\nThat was a fabulous battle!\c[speechbubble]: Ooh!\nIt electrified me![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Okay, gotcha.\nWe'll call it quits here this\ntime.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That's it!\nYes! SPLASH!\nWay to go![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: You're battling JUSTY!\nShow him you're tough![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm in shock!\nHow could you beat JUSTY?\c[speechbubble]: Ooh!\nIt electrified me![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Hello!\nAre you in the mood for some battling\nwith our trainers again?
JUSTY: Okay, gotcha.\nLet's get a battle started.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, are you traveling?\nAww, I envy you!\c[speechbubble]: Is it a journey to become an expert\ntrainer?\nOr a quest to meet POKéMON?\nEither way, you make me jealous![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I've been to the next town just\nonce, but I was too scared to go in.\c[speechbubble]: The people there are savages.\nAll they ever think about is battling![dialogue_end]
MIROR B.: Oh, now aren't you boys\nfrightfully pathetic?\nYou mean to tell me you were bested\nby these darling infants?\cMIROR B.: Darling, did you say your\nname was [Player] or something?\cMIROR B.: I so don't like saying this,\nbut we're not at liberty to keep your\nlady friend at liberty.\cMIROR B.: That sweet young thing,\nshe can see things that ordinary people\naren't supposed to see.\cMIROR B.: That just will not do for\nwhat we're planning to do.\nNo, it just won't do at all.\cMIROR B.: If you don't like pain, like\nmost people, you can avoid the pain\nby keeping your nose out of places\nit needn't be.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Nazo nazaoon![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hm?\nI'd guess you're a traveling trainer.\c[speechbubble]: Hm...\nI like what I see in your expression.\c[speechbubble]: Fufufu...\nI have a feeling I may see you again\nsomewhere.[dialogue_end]
JUSTY: If you're in the mood for\nbattling, feel free to visit us.\nYou're always welcome.[dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Whoa, that was inspiring!\nYou showed me a great battle!\cJUSTY: It deserves a gift!\nI want you to have this.[dialogue_end]
JUSTY: You don't have a full party\nof POKéMON yet.\nWhen you get six of them, I'd like you\nto come see me again.\cJUSTY: That's when I will be your\nopponent.\nI'll be looking forward to it![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Oh, hello!\nI guess you finally got your sixth\nPOKéMON for your party.\cJUSTY: Well, then.\nWould you like to battle against me?
JUSTY: Oh, okay.\nWell, if you get in the mood for it,\nbe sure to visit.\cJUSTY: I'll always be waiting for\nyou.[dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Okay, gotcha!\nThis is making me feel sort of giddy![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Okay, let's get this battle\nunder way.\nShow me a great battle![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: So, what's up?\nWould you like to have a rematch with\nme right away?
JUSTY: Wha-What?[dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Wow, that was one challenging\nand satisfying battle.\cJUSTY: Look at this.\nMy palms are drenched with sweat.\cJUSTY: There's no shame in this loss!\nI'm one lucky guy for being a part\nof this spectacular battle.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sorry to break it to you, but\nI'm not about to let you pass.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Or do you have this idea that\nyou can take me in a battle?
VERDE: Y-You... You're tough!\nTRUDLY and FOLLY can't be blamed for\nlosing![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: I'm glad that I got the\nopportunity to battle with you.\cJUSTY: I want you to have this.\nConsider it a memento of our battle![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Honestly, our battle was\nfantastic.\nI will never forget the battle we had![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Oh, hey! Wait!\nWait a second![dialogue_end]
JUSTY: Honestly, our battle was\nfantastic.\nI will never forget the battle we had![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Mgflpmmmgg... Beh!\nHelp! Someone let me out!\nKidnappers![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Phew!\nThank goodness!\nI'm saved![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hello, and welcome to the\nPOKéMON CENTER.\c[speechbubble]: We restore your tired POKéMON to\nfull health.\c[speechbubble]: Would you like to rest your\nPOKéMON?
[speechbubble]: Oh! Is that so?\nThank you!\nAnd... Uh... You are?\c[speechbubble]: Oh!\nSo you're named [Player]!\nI am...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: We hope to see you again![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: My name's [Rui].\nI'm sure glad I met you!\c[Rui]: I was in the neighboring\ntown when those two grabbed me...[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Oh...\nNo...\nNo, that's fine, then. [dialogue_end]
[Rui]: The MAYOR?\nYes, that's true!\c[Rui]: The MAYOR might know\nsomething![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Oh, but...\nThose men might come back...\c[Rui]: Please, can I get you to\nstick with me for just a while?
[Rui]: Thank you, [Player]!\nEheh, I thought you might say that!\c[Rui]: If you're with me,\n[Player], it won't matter if those\nguys come back again!\c[Rui]: Thank you!\nThanks for joining me for a while![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hey, [Player]!\nCome on, hand it over!\nGive back the SNAG MACHINE you ripped\noff from the HIDEOUT![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: The SNAG MACHINE's built for\ntrainers.\nWhen a trainer puts the SNAG MACHINE\non, their POKé BALLS are converted.\c[speechbubble]: Ordinary POKé BALLS are turned into\nSNAG BALLS that can steal POKéMON\nfrom their trainers in battle.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Eeeek! Somebody!\nRobbers! They're robbers![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, yuck!\nThere's someone inside there![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Rrrrmmm...\nIt's no good.\nI'm not strong enough to undo\nthis knot.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Please!\nWe need your help![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This is PHENAC CITY, the opulent\ncity of water.\c[speechbubble]: This person saved you from those\nthugs.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Well, it's easy to see something's\non your mind.\nYou should go see our MAYOR for\nhis advice.\c[speechbubble]: He's a very kindly person.\nI'm sure that he'll be able to help you\nsomehow.\c[speechbubble]: The MAYOR's house is near the\nfountain square past here.\nGo up the stairs from the square,\nand it's on your left.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: The MAYOR's house is near the\nfountain square past here.\nGo up the stairs from the square,\nand it's on your left.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, hi, you two.\nWe just noticed, but the truck that\nwas here is gone.\c[speechbubble]: Those thugs must have come back\nand taken off in it.\c[speechbubble]: I bet they came from PYRITE TOWN.\nI'm sure of it![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh! It's you two!\nSomething terrible's happening![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, you must be travelers.\nAre you POKéMON trainers, too?
[Rui]: Who are these people?\nHuh?\nAre they TEAM SNAGEM?!\c[Rui]: And what did they mean by\ntraitor?\n[Player]...\nYou mean...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I knew it!\nI was certain that you were!\c[speechbubble]: Well, if you want to make a record\nof your progress, you should save on\nthe PC at the back.\c[speechbubble]: The PC at any POKéMON CENTER is\navailable for use by any trainer.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: No way!\nIs it true, [Player]?
[speechbubble]: Is that so?\nBut you just don't look like ordinary\ntravelers to me.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Oh, so it is true!\nThat's a little shocking![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Oh!\nYou gritted your teeth, didn't you?\nDidn't you?!\c[Rui]: Then it must be true!\nThat's a little shocking![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: SNAG MACHINE?\n[Player], do you really have\nsomething like that?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: POKéMON gain experience by\nwinning battles.\nOnce they gain enough experience,\nthey level up.\c[speechbubble]: By leveling up, POKéMON learn all\nsorts of different moves.\c[speechbubble]: It's up to the trainer to mix and\nmatch those moves to suit the opponent.\nThat's how trainers can show off their\nskills.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I took the opportunity to thoroughly\nexamine your battling style.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I can't believe it!\nI get to see JUSTY battle right in front\nof my own eyes!\nI'm the luckiest girl alive!\c[speechbubble]: JUSTY!\nGo for it![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ohhhh!\nJUSTY lost![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Player] whited out![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]The sack's mouth is firmly closed with\na tightly knotted rope.\cUndo the knot?
[unknown_3D][Player] tugged hard on the tightly\nknotted rope.\cThe knot gradually loosened.\c[Player] undid the knot, keeping\nthe sack's mouth closed.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That large house is the MAYOR's\nhome.\c[speechbubble]: If something concerns you while\nyou're traveling, you should visit\nthe MAYOR for his advice.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Rui] became a partner![dialogue_end]　　　
[speechbubble]: Shudder...\nDid you see that man's eyes?\nThey were so cutting and cold...\c[speechbubble]: Look at me.\nIt's not cold, but I'm covered in goose\npimples.\nShudder...[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Player] whited out![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: My goodness! It's terrible!\nA big group of shady-looking men\nmarched into the MAYOR's house![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Player] obtained TM41![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Isn't this awful?\nWhat are all these horrible people\ndoing here?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh!\nYou were safe?\c[speechbubble]: The MAYOR wasn't home, either,\nI hear.\nAll's well that ends well![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm glad everything's fine.\nThe MAYOR's back home now.\c[speechbubble]: I was worried that he'd been taken\nprisoner by those horrid men.\nIt's so good that nothing bad came\nof this.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Welcome to PHENAC CITY...\c[speechbubble]: Oh, hi, it's you two!\nI'm so glad to see you're safe!\nI was so worried about you.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Even after that incident, there have\nbeen all sorts of people coming and\ngoing from the MAYOR's house.\c[speechbubble]: The MAYOR's job certainly keeps\nhim busy.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: I get it, [Player].\nThat's why these creeps are chasing\nafter you.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Aiyeeeeh!\nHelp! Please, someone, help!\nIt's TEAM SNAGEM!\nTEAM SNAGEM's here![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Aiyeeeh![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Well, what do you know,\n[Player].\nSo you're from TEAM SNAGEM.\c[Rui]: Oh, right.\nTo be accurate, I should say former\nTEAM SNAGEM.\c[Rui]: It's okay.\n[Player], it doesn't matter to me\nwho you are.\c[Rui]: After all, you're my gallant\nprince who rescued me when I was in\ntrouble.\c[Rui]: So, it doesn't matter.\nBesides, I thought up something after\nlistening to those creeps.\c[Rui]: Listen, [Player].\nWe should go shopping for some POKé\nBALLS.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Um... Er...[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: I... I saw it![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: I saw a peculiar\nPOKéMON...\nNo, that's not quite right.\c[Rui]: What I saw was a POKéMON\nthat gave off a black aura.\nIt was like a fighting machine!\c[Rui]: And, that POKéMON would\nattack people![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: It's true!\nIt's true, Mr. MAYOR!\c[Rui]: Because I saw that\nPOKéMON, I was made the prisoner of\nsome frightening men until just a little\nwhile ago.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: You will?\nThank you, Mr. MAYOR![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Master MIROR B.!\nIt's... It's him!\nHe's the one that took the girl from us![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: To catch a wild POKéMON, you need\na POKé BALL of some sort.\nThat's common knowledge.\c[speechbubble]: But, as you know, there are no wild\nPOKéMON around these parts.\c[speechbubble]: So there's no demand for POKé\nBALLS.\nMeaning nobody sells them.\nThat's common knowledge, too.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: No one sells POKé BALLS around\nthese parts.\nThat's common knowledge.\c[speechbubble]: The guy that runs the OUTSKIRT\nSTAND used to sell them before.\nBut you have to keep that a secret.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, yes?\nSo you've been to PYRITE, have you?\c[speechbubble]: Actually, PYRITE TOWN has two faces.\nThe face above and face below, hehe.\nThat's common knowledge.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Pururuun.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hi, big guy!\nLook, look!\nThis is really neat!\c[speechbubble]: See?\nIt's a map of PHENAC CITY!\nIsn't it cool?[dialogue_end]
FOLLY: You, you, you!\nThe last time, you caught me off guard!\nThat's not gonna happen again![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Just as I thought...\nThere are many other POKéMON with\nthat black aura.\c[Rui]: [Player], let's go.\nThose guys are probably headed for\nPYRITE TOWN.\c[Rui]: After all, it was in PYRITE\nthat they captured me.\c[Rui]: That town must be hiding\na big secret![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Awww, blast it!\nI got tripped up again![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Hey, what are you saying?\nYou're not supposed to be impressed![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Heh!\nYou should've stayed tucked away in\nyour beddy-byes upstairs![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Awww, blast it!\nI got tripped up again![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Yeah, you say that, but this...\nIt won't stop squirming.\nMakes it tough to hold on.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: [Player]!\nThat's it!\nIt's that POKéMON!\c[Rui]: Those guys kidnapped me\nbecause I saw that POKéMON!\c[Rui]: I can see it!\nThat POKéMON has a black aura!\nThey've done something to it![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Tch!\nThat tape didn't keep her yap shut![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: [Player], be careful!\nJust as I thought, that POKéMON will\nattack people!\c[Rui]: [Player], I know!\nIt's not something I like, but this\nis a desperate situation.\c[Rui]: Please, Snag that poor\nPOKéMON back from those horrible\nthugs!\c[Rui]: You can... No.\nOnly you can do it![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Y-You be quiet!\nWe're no robbers!\nWe're kidnappers!\nGet it? Kidnappers![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: ...Wait. Oh, no!\nWhy don't you have any POKé BALLS\nwith you?[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: [Player], don't!\nIt's wrong to Snag an ordinary\nPOKéMON![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Oh, it's disappointing that\nwe couldn't Snag that POKéMON off\nthem.\c[Rui]: But I'm sure there are\nothers like it.\c[Rui]: Let's get all of them back\nfrom the bad guys![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: You did it, [Player]!\nYou Snagged that POKéMON from that\ngoon!\c[Rui]: But I'm sure there are\nothers like it.\c[Rui]: Let's get all of them back\nfrom the bad guys![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Gwonn![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]Large gears are rotating.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Arrrgh! I choked!\nI let victory slip from my grasp at\nthe last knockout challenge.\c[speechbubble]: And it's not just once either.\nIt was the time before, and the time\nbefore that, too!\nIf I wasn't a guy, I could cry...\c[speechbubble]: Hey! I know what to do.\nI'll go ask PYRITE's MOTHER.\nI'll ask her when I'll finally win that\nchallenge![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What did you just say?\nThe power's gone out in the\nCOLOSSEUM?!\c[speechbubble]: Tell me you're joking!\nI was supposed to win the knockout\nchallenge this time!\c[speechbubble]: Uh... Well...\nIt's not like I actually had my fortune\nread or anything. Yeah.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm guessing the next challenge's\nabout to start at the COLOSSEUM.\nAre you going in?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Battle, battle, so much fun!\nPOKéMON battles for everyone!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Battles bring me so much joy!\nLet's get started, little boy![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Battles here aren't for wimps.\nTry hard not to go out in the first\nround!\nGahahah![dialogue_end]
LON: I hope you like my show,\nbut now it's time for me to go![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Is that right?\nThen that must mean you're sight-\nseeing.\c[speechbubble]: Well, while you do that, why don't\nyou make yourself useful and be my\ncheerleaders?\nGahahah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, everyone!\nWe've all had our fun!\nUntil next week, farewell![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Arrrgh! I choked!\nRight before my battle, I suddenly got\na bellyache.\nI couldn't go out there.\c[speechbubble]: The next time I enter, I'd better ask\nPYRITE's MOTHER if my stomach will\nbehave while I'm battling.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]The door is locked.[dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Wh-What?!\nNot you two again![dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Hey, hey, don't open the door!\nWhat do you think would happen if\nMIROR B. found us here?[dialogue_end]
FOLLY: Listen, you have to promise.\nDon't tell MIROR B. that we're hiding\nout here, okay?[dialogue_end]
MIROR B.: Oh, yes indeed, Master\nNASCOUR!\nOur plan is coming along in a lovely,\npeachy-keen way.\cMIROR B.: We have already broken\nDUKING's spirit.\nWe can do as we please at the\nCOLOSSEUM without his meddling.\cMIROR B.: We've been giving away\nSHADOW POKéMON on the sly to\nchallenge winners for gathering\ndata.[dialogue_end]
MIROR B.: Fuhohoho!\nThis is perking up my spirit and body!\nOh, I feel like dancing![dialogue_end]
MIROR B.: Okay, then...\cMIROR B.: I shall make my return to\nthe cave where my darling POKéMON\nawait my return!\cMIROR B.: Let the music play![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That's why, MARCIA.\nWe've got to somehow Snag them from\nthose criminals...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That's why, MARCIA.\nIn the back of the building that they're\nholed up in...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Everything will be okay, MARCIA.\nThose big people will...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm sorry, but the current challenge\nis already under way.\c[speechbubble]: Please wait for the next challenge's\nregistration.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, good.\nYou see, the challenge has already\nstarted.\c[speechbubble]: Please take part in the next\nchallenge.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]The door is locked.[dialogue_end]
JOHNSON: Huh?!\nBut isn't SILVA DUKING's trusted\nlieutenant?\nWhat's his motive for doing this?[dialogue_end]
JOHNSON: There's big trouble!\nThe COLOSSEUM must be in an uproar\nby now without any power![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]こちらからは　{開|ひら}かないようだ[dialogue_end]

MARCIA: Oh, hi, big people.\cMARCIA: I'm sorry.\nBut we're still not finished talking.\nPlease visit another time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hohohoho!\nDo you feel like sticking around for\na demonstration of my POKéMON's\nmoves?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good, good.\nI like your attitude.\nFeast your eyes on these![dialogue_end]
DIOGO: You outperformed me![dialogue_end]
DIOGO: You're surprisingly good.\nI think you deserve to know a little\nsecret about a certain POKéMON move.\cDIOGO: The move SHADOW RUSH inflicts\ndamage on any kind of POKéMON\nwithout being affected by their types.\cDIOGO: The amount of damage doesn't\nvary with the target POKéMON's type,\nso it's easy to use.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, is that so?\nYou're missing out if you don't see\nthe moves my POKéMON have.[dialogue_end]
SHERLES: CHIEF!\nAre you all right?![dialogue_end]
SHERLES: Hm...\nDUKING and SILVA had a falling out?\cSHERLES: No, that can't be right.\nSILVA would never betray DUKING.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hi, there!\nYou must be the superb trainer who\nhas emerged triumphant in our latest\nbattle challenge.\c[speechbubble]: MIROR B., the town's true mover\nand shaker, wishes you to have\na gorgeous gift.\c[speechbubble]: Now, follow me.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Um... I'm the lookout!\nNobody is supposed to get by me!\c[speechbubble]: There's nothing special behind\nthe bookshelf![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: The man that went out is SILVA.\nHe's DUKING's friend.\c[speechbubble]: But he was really angry.\nHis face looked all scary.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm the lookout!\nI'm not letting anyone past me\nbut you![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm still on lookout duty.\nDUKING has gone out.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm still stuck on lookout duty.\nI'm not a crybaby, but my feet are\nstarting to hurt...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Welcome to PYRITE COLOSSEUM!\nAre you here to register for entry?
[speechbubble]: We have a terrible problem!\nThe COLOSSEUM doors suddenly\nstopped working.\nThey won't open!\c[speechbubble]: Oh, I don't know what to do!\nWe can't hold battles this way.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Thank you for your patience!\nThe power has been turned back on.\nI'll be happy to accept registrations\nfor the next challenge.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: [Player], congratulations!\nYou have won the knockout challenge!\c[speechbubble]: You have won the $[unknown_4B] cash\nprize and the top [some_item_2D]\nprize![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: The name's DUKING.\nI run the COLOSSEUM here.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This is PYRITE, the town of earth,\nwind, and money.\c[speechbubble]: You appear to be outsiders.\nYou had best beware.\nThere are many ne'er-do-well sorts\nhere.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: ...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Your winning streak was amazing!\nI hope you will participate again![dialogue_end]
DUKING: Sorry, but I'm busy.\nYou'll have to excuse me.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: If you want to enter a\nchallenge, go see the COLOSSEUM's\nreceptionist.\cDUKING: Now, if you'll excuse me,\nI'm busy.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: What?!\nSILVA cut the power to the\nCOLOSSEUM?\nGrrr...[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]There are marks on the floor as if\nthe bookshelf has been dragged on it.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]One of the gears is missing![dialogue_end]
DUKING: Be careful always!\nMIROR B. might look like a clown,\nbut his battling is all business![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you try talking to anyone in\nDUEL SQUARE, there's only one answer![dialogue_end]
LEBA: Oh, boo!\nI had to lose?[dialogue_end]
LEBA: Ooh, that was an incredible\nbattle!\nI simply love strong guys!\nThat's L-O-V-E!\cLEBA: If you ever get the urge to\nbattle with me again, I'll always be\nhere for you, honey![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Right, I'm back with our latest\nchallenge champion.\c[speechbubble]: Let's present our lucky winner with\na SHADOW POKéMON and watch chaos\nunleashed!\nFufufu...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Wh-What?\nThat same guy who messed with us\nin PHENAC CITY?\c[speechbubble]: Gaaah!\nI didn't know that when I let him\nin here!\nI'll boot you back out![dialogue_end]
NORE: Huh, what?!\nYou're back again?!\cNORE: I'll fix you so you never come\nback again![dialogue_end]
NORE: It's no surprise now how you\nmanaged to win the tournament.[dialogue_end]
NORE: It's useless!\nI don't stand a chance of winning![dialogue_end]
DUKING: Oh!\nYou're safe!\nI heard you entered this building.\nIt had me worried.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: SHADOW POKéMON?\nThose ferocious POKéMON that even\nattack people?![dialogue_end]
DUKING: Grrr...\nThey were using the COLOSSEUM to\ndo that?![dialogue_end]
DUKING: It's humiliating.\nBut with PLUSLE in their filthy hands,\nmy own hands are tied...[dialogue_end]
DUKING: Thanks for everything...\nI have to depend on you.\nI have no choice.\cDUKING: Be careful always!\nMIROR B. might look like a clown,\nbut his battling is all business![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This WINDMILL generates electricity\nfor powering the COLOSSEUM.\c[speechbubble]: It may look a little worse for wear,\nbut it's still going strong in active\nservice.[dialogue_end]

JOHNSON: That's strange...\nThe number of prisoners doesn't\nmatch the records...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Too bad for you!\nThis elevator is off-limits![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Psst, listen.\nIf you were offered ten POTIONS\nfor $10, would you want them?
[speechbubble]: If there was a deal that good,\nI'd keep it to myself!\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, you've no spirit of fun.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kyahahahah!\nYou're looking to battle with me?

VANT: Ggggyooooh![dialogue_end]
VANT: Wow.\nThat was easy for you.\nLosing like that snapped me out of\nmy hyper state.\cVANT: Did you know?\nIf a POKéMON goes into HYPER MODE,\nCALL its name, and its head will snap\nback into reality.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, you're a smart one!\nAll you'd do is lose anyway!\nKyahahahah![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, for thirty long years,\nI have spun these gears ～♪\c[speechbubble]: Oh, what's with you, younglings?\nDo you want to spin gears, too?
[speechbubble]: Fwaaaah, boy, that was a good sleep.\nI must've slept through all of last week.\c[speechbubble]: I was totally exhausted from the\nTOWER construction job.\c[speechbubble]: Apparently some fabulously rich\nguy had the TOWER built.\nIt's amazing stuff.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Wahaha!\nNot to disappoint you, but this isn't\na job that anyone can just pick up.\c[speechbubble]: Give it another twenty years, then\ncome back.\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Wahaha!\nNo doubt, no doubt!\c[speechbubble]: I've been doing this for thirty\nyears!\nOnly I can do this!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Owowowow...\nThat SILVA's gone too far this time.\c[speechbubble]: He ripped out and ripped off one of\nthe gears.\c[speechbubble]: The COLOSSEUM's going to be\nwithout power![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Yeah, the only thing bruised is my\npride.\nIt was only SILVA, so I wasn't\nexpecting any trouble.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That's what I want to know.\nHe was ranting about how the\nCOLOSSEUM can just shut down\nor something.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Sorry to worry you younglings.\nThanks.\nI'll be fine now.\c[speechbubble]: But I need to ask for a favor.\nWill you hear me out?
[speechbubble]: If the COLOSSEUM loses power,\nthe whole town suffers.\c[speechbubble]: I need you to find that GEAR SILVA\nran off with.\nI'm counting on you younglings![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, now, don't be that way.\nHear me out.
[speechbubble]: SILVA...\nHe must have been driven to\ndesperation...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Awww, Mr. JOHNSON, give a man\na break here.\c[speechbubble]: I keep telling you.\nI don't know anything.[dialogue_end]
CAIL: Mr. JOHNSON, sir!\nI wouldn't think about lying to you!\nYou've got to believe me, right?[dialogue_end]
CAIL: Heheh! What a nitwit.\nOf course I haven't got a thing to\ntell you![dialogue_end]
CAIL: What are you looking at?\nI haven't seen your faces around\nthese parts.\nWhat are you, tourists?\cCAIL: If you don't want to get hurt,\nyou should get lost, and quick.\nFor the good of your health.\nHeheh.[dialogue_end]
CAIL: Hah? What's that?\nYou're wanting to know if I have\na weird POKéMON?\cCAIL: Hehe.\nIf you want to know that much, you\nmay as well see it with your own eyes![dialogue_end]
CAIL: Whaaaat?!\nMy SHADOW POKéMON was beaten?![dialogue_end]
CAIL: M-My SHADOW POKéMON![dialogue_end]
CAIL: Bah!\nThat was it?\nThat lying MIROR B.!\cCAIL: He came up with that fancy\ntough-sounding name, SHADOW\nPOKéMON, but it was no big deal!\cCAIL: You guys be careful, too.\nDon't be played for a sucker.\nThat's about all they'll give you if you\nwin at the COLOSSEUM.[dialogue_end]
CAIL: People talk, hey?\nThe word is, there's a lot scarier\npresence in the shadows behind that\nMIROR B.\cCAIL: It's probably best that you don't\nstick your nose too deeply in there.\nFor the good of your health.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ayup. I'm fine.\nThere's no need for all the worrying.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: No, no.\nI reckon he agonized over this and\ndid it because he thought it right.\nI can't blame the man for that.\c[speechbubble]: Enough about that, DUKING.\nInstead, I think you should look over\nthere.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hehe.\nI reckon you might be saying thanks,\nDUKING.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: All right.\nI'll get you to slot that GEAR snugly\nback in that gap where it belongs.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: All done!\nStanding by!\nLet it roll!\c[speechbubble]: Oh, thirty long years\nof cranking gears ～♪\nOh, yeah![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Wahaha!\nThis is the way it ought to be.\nThings are fine now.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That MIROR B.'s a bad parasite.\nIf only someone'd stomp that pest...\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo.\nYour outfit's kind of weird, but you're\na trainer, too, aren't you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good. That's okay, then.\nI'll teach you about one of the few\nrules this town has.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Here, we have street battles\nrather than exchanging greetings![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: People call FATEEN the MOTHER OF\nPYRITE.\nHer ability as a fortune-teller is\nhighly regarded.\c[speechbubble]: Why, just a while ago, she even\ndetermined where my wife is living\nsince she left me...\nSob...[dialogue_end]
CALDA: Whoops!\nYou were better than me![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Find what you seek, be it an object,\nperson, or luck.\nWelcome to FATEEN's FORTUNE-TELLING\nCHAMBER.\c[speechbubble]: Oh, wait.\nThese aren't my lines, they're\nFATEEN's.\nEhehe.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Good. That's okay, then.\nI'll teach you about one of the few\nrules this town has.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Here, we have street battles\nrather than exchanging greetings![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: DUKING!\nThis is where they were giving\nSHADOW POKéMON to the winners of\nbattle challenges![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: They were just going to open\nregistration for the next challenge,\nbut now this!\nWhat's going on here?[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Yes!\nThey're giving away SHADOW POKéMON\nto thugs for some reason.\nIt doesn't look good.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hehehe.\nHere's my chance to win the knockout\nchallenge and score myself an awesome\nPOKéMON...\c[speechbubble]: Oh, sheesh, what am I saying?\nYou have to keep that a secret!\nPretend you never heard me, okay?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Wow, really.\nSo you really went and won it all.\nIt'll be my turn next![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: He did what?!\nMIROR B. used a dirty move like that?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, nice one.\nOur new champ is quite the appealing\ncharmer.\c[speechbubble]: It makes a nice change from the\nparade of macho musclemen...\nWait! This isn't happening![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: He's not getting away\nwith this!\nThat rotten MIROR B.!\c[Rui]: But we're here now!\nWe'll get PLUSLE back for you!\nRight, [Player]?
[speechbubble]: Oh, hey! Champ!\nDid they really give you an awesome\nPOKéMON?
[speechbubble]: Now, hold on!\nYou're the one who brought him here![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: It's no time for joking!\nWe have to rescue DUKING's PLUSLE\nand put a stop to MIROR B.
[speechbubble]: Awwwww, dude!\nI want one, too! Yes, I do![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Giggle!\nI know I can always count on you,\n[Player]![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Excellent!\nI like a man who can come to a quick\ndecision!\nLet's have it out![dialogue_end]
NOVER: You're saying I lost?![dialogue_end]
NOVER: Right, then!\nI like your style!\nHere's a useful tip.\cNOVER: If a POKéMON goes into HYPER\nMODE, its attacks become more likely\nto be critical hits.\nWhat a surprise, hey?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Everyone's itching for the\nchance to battle it out.\nIf you ever get the urge, come back.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: Terribly sorry, CHIEF.\nYou're sure you're okay?[dialogue_end]
DUKING: Good. That's good...\nBut SILVA...\nThis is an outrage...[dialogue_end]
DUKING: Wha...\nYou people?[dialogue_end]
DUKING: Th-That's the GEAR!\nYou found it for us?\nWhat amazing luck![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]A worn gear is on the floor.\nIt appears to be junk.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: I can tell that you're a man\nof courage and honor.\nI have a favor to ask.\nWill you hear me out?
DUKING: I'm grateful.\nI want you to enter the next\nCOLOSSEUM battle.\cDUKING: I need you to win the\nknockout challenge and find out\nwhat is going on there.\cDUKING: I can tell from a glance that\nyou're no ordinary trainer.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: I have no one else to turn to.\nPlease, hear me out.
[speechbubble]: Tch!\nI didn't get here in time to make the\nregistration.\c[speechbubble]: I've heard rumors that if you win\nthe challenge, you get an awesome\nPOKéMON like that CAIL did...\c[speechbubble]: Oh, sheesh, what am I saying?\nYou have to keep that a secret!\nPretend you never heard me, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, look at what we have here.\nYou're quite the hottie.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why don't you lose that\nwallflower with you and be my sweetie?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha!\nLook at her, she's all serious!\nUncool!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm only teasing out of boredom.\nA guy like him, he's not to my taste.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Stomp?\nWho, me?\nAhaha! That's a laugh!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come on, then.\nI'll go easy on you![dialogue_end]
EMOK: You got all serious![dialogue_end]
EMOK: What kind of a man battles\na frail girl like me without easing up?\nYou're not going to win the hearts of\ngirls that way.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: PYRITE TOWN's always had a history\nas a rough town.\nWith all the muscle-bound roughnecks\nabout, that's not a surprise.\c[speechbubble]: But when DUKING was in charge,\nthere wasn't any of this lawlessness\nthat you see today.\c[speechbubble]: What's come over DUKING?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, have you lost something?\nI have the same problem.\nI often have to search for my glasses.\c[speechbubble]: But I pity you.\nHow could you be so forgetful at your\nage?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: There are many who still look up to\nDUKING.\c[speechbubble]: Why, I'm one of them.\c[speechbubble]: I wish DUKING would restore order\nand return this town to its former\nglory as an honorable town of thugs\nand scoundrels.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Greetings!\nWelcome to the PYRITE SUPER \nGRAND HOTEL!\c[speechbubble]: Stay in one of our ultra-gorgeous\nsuites, and you'll be refreshed\nlike you're brand-new!\nYour POKéMON, too!\c[speechbubble]: It's a mere $[unknown_4B] a night.\nWill you stay with us?
[speechbubble]: Fine, fine.\nHope you enjoy staying with us.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: So?\nDid you get a good rest?\c[speechbubble]: The next time you need to stay,\nmake sure it's right here at the PYRITE\nSUPER GRAND HOTEL again.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Whoa, sorry, folks.\nYou don't have the money.\c[speechbubble]: I'm a bighearted guy, but I can't\ndo much about this...\nSorry, but try your luck somewhere\nelse.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: [Player]!\nWasn't CAIL that guy who was hanging\naround the town's entrance?\c[Rui]: We should ask him.\nHe might know something.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, that's too bad, then.\c[speechbubble]: The next time you need to stay\na night, make sure it's right here at\nthe PYRITE SUPER GRAND HOTEL.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hmm!\nYou thugs must be MIROR B.'s newest\nrecruits!\c[speechbubble]: Well, shoo! Beat it!\nI don't have any money to give to\nthe likes of you![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Wait a second!\nWho are you to call me a wallflower?\nWhat about me makes me a wallflower?[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Grrrrr!\nThat's it!\nI'm furious now!\c[Rui]: [Player]!\nBe a man; stomp her down![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: [Player]...\nIt was here in this square that I saw\nthat strange POKéMON.\c[Rui]: I tried to leave town\nafterwards, and that's when those\ncreeps grabbed me.\c[Rui]: We should be careful.\nEven at the best of times, there's\nnothing normal about this town.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Just as I thought!\nThese guys have those strange\nPOKéMON![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Why do the trainers here\nhave those strange POKéMON?\c[Rui]: I'm sure of it now.\nThe town's hiding a big secret![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: SHADOW POKéMON?\nThat's what it's called?\nA SHADOW POKéMON?\nThat POKéMON with the black aura...[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: It looks like the\nCOLOSSEUM has a secret.\c[Rui]: I guess there's no choice\nbut to take part in a battle challenge\nthere![dialogue_end]
JOHNSON: That better be true, CAIL.\nIf you're trying to con me, I'll know\nabout it![dialogue_end]
JOHNSON: All right, fine.\nI'll let you off easy today.\nSee you![dialogue_end]
SHERLES: MIROR B....\nJust you wait... SHERLES here will set\nyour crooked ways straight![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm here, JOHNSON...\nThat story isn't new.\nI've heard about it over and over\nalready.[dialogue_end]
SHERLES: I've realized that peace\nwon't return to this town without\nDUKING's rule.\cSHERLES: Why DUKING lets MIROR B.\ndo as he pleases...\nThat's the question and the problem.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: My name's SHERLES.\nI'm the CHIEF of police in this town.\nAre you two travelers?
[speechbubble]: My sister hasn't done anything but\nchatter.\nI'm so bored.\c[speechbubble]: I want to play house.[dialogue_end]
SHERLES: I see.\nWell, whether you are or not, it would\nbe best if you were to get out of the\ntown as soon as possible.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Zzz...\nI hope PLUSLE's okay...\c[speechbubble]: Zzz...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Gasp, gasp...\nMy heart is going thump-thump still.\c[speechbubble]: I wanted to play house, but I had to\nrun instead.\nGasp, gasp...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I trust things are going according to\nplan, MIROR B.[dialogue_end]
NASCOUR: Good.\nThe others also appear to be doing\ntheir parts to implement our plan.\cNASCOUR: Our SHADOW POKéMON plan\nis falling into place quickly.\nThe final phase is not far off.[dialogue_end]
NASCOUR: Save your dancing until our\nplan succeeds.\nI'm off.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Zzz...\nMutter...\c[speechbubble]: Okay! TACKLE now!\nNo! Don't get confused!\nZzz...[dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: After we blew our last chance,\nwe couldn't go back.\nSo we turned ourselves in for stealing\nthat truck and here we are![dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: Even if you open that door,\nwe're not going to make a dash for it.[dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: Even if you begged us,\nwe're still not going to leave here.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D][Player] obtained $[unknown_4B]!\c[Player] obtained the\n[some_item_2D]![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hey, what...\nOh, wow, thanks!\nYou're letting us loose?\c[speechbubble]: Hey, I don't know or care who you\nare, but thanks!\nSee you![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: It wasn't that long ago when DUKING\nwas the man in PYRITE.\c[speechbubble]: But now, that right-out-there-weird\nMIROR B. and his stooges ride herd\nover the town.\c[speechbubble]: I wonder what's so special about\nthat MIROR B. guy.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Are you trying to sell me something?\nWell, sorry, I don't need anything.\nPlease leave.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What's that? A gear?\nWhy would I need something like that?\nPlease leave.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Are you trying to sell me something?\nWell, sorry, I don't need anything.\nPlease leave.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Aiyiyi, that's scary.\nTake a look down there.\nIt feels like it's going to suck you\nright in.\c[speechbubble]: This crevasse runs deep under the\nground.\nYou can't even see the bottom\nfrom here.\c[speechbubble]: You see, PYRITE's an old mining town.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: It's quite strange.\nThe WINDMILL came to a sudden stop\na while ago, and it's stayed that way.\c[speechbubble]: I wonder what's wrong?\nDid it have a breakdown?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: DUKING had this POKéMON that he\ntreated royally.\nI haven't seen it around lately, though.\c[speechbubble]: I hope it's not sick or anything like\nthat.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou want to battle me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sure thing!\nBattling fans are always welcome![dialogue_end]
DIVEL: Waaah! Whew![dialogue_end]
DIVEL: You're way tough!\nWe've gotta battle again![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What, you won't?\nThis is DUEL SQUARE, man.\nWhat's the point if you're not going\nto battle?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: DUKING!\nHow much more are you going to take\nfrom MIROR B. and his stooges?!\c[speechbubble]: They're using you and the\nCOLOSSEUM!\c[speechbubble]: What is the matter with you?\nHave they sucked the spirit right out\nof you?![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Tch. So you just clam up.\nI've lost faith in you![dialogue_end]
MARCIA: Big lady! My papa...\nPapa's POKéMON was taken away\nby MIROR B. as a prisoner![dialogue_end]
MARCIA: It's Papa's PLUSLE.\nI'm so worried that they might be\nmean to it...[dialogue_end]
MARCIA: Big people, please help\nPLUSLE![dialogue_end]

FATEEN: Oh! Oh!\nWhat is the meaning of this?\cFATEEN: Hmm...\nYou are at the center of a monumental\nincident, it seems.\cFATEEN: It is pointless for me to say\nany more about it.\nYou must make your way to the\nCOLOSSEUM.\cFATEEN: Your fortune has been told.\nAnd it requires you to win at the\nCOLOSSEUM.\nGo, and do your best.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Fwofwofwo.\nCome back if you have a change of\nheart.\nNo harm will come from what I do.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Fwofwofwo.\nYou seek what is missing before you\nenter the COLOSSEUM, yes?\cFATEEN: Or, have you sought me to\nhave your fortune read?
FATEEN: However, you've come at\na most inconvenient time.\nI am busy with this customer, as you\ncan see.\cFATEEN: This time, you must find what\nyou seek yourself.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Good, good, that's the spirit.\nI'll leave you to your own devices to\nfind what you seek.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: My.\nI see you've found what you sought\nwithout my help.\nWell done![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: POTION, PARLYZ HEAL...\c[speechbubble]: There's all sorts of stuff I want,\nbut I don't have the money...\c[speechbubble]: Well, I guess it doesn't matter.\nI don't have any POKéMON anyways.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: You've been crowned as the\nwinner in the battle challenge.\nWell done.\nYou've impressed me.\cFATEEN: Oh?\nI see a small POKéMON crying troubled\ntears somewhere.\nQuickly, you must save it.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: S-Someone...\nThere's trouble...\nH-Help me...[dialogue_end]

WILLIE: Since we battled, I've been\nhaving battles with you in my head.\cWILLIE: You know, like what I should've\ndone when you did that, or what I\nneeded to do when you did this...\cWILLIE: Oh, right!\nThat's what I should've done!\nOkay, I'm not losing next time![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Yo!\nWait! Wait up![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh?\nI haven't seen your face around these\nparts.\nA traveler, huh?\c[speechbubble]: Not that it matters any.\nI don't know where you might've come\nfrom, but relax, stick around a while.[dialogue_end]
WILLIE: Oh, hey, it's you!\nI was worried about you.\cWILLIE: Some rough-looking characters\ncame around asking about you.\nIt made me worried.\cWILLIE: Those guys, they looked like\nthey're from TEAM SNAGEM.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hey, my name's WILLIE.\nAfter I got a good look at you, well,\nI got this urge to battle you.\nIt's like I'm compelled to.\cWILLIE: Any way I look at it, it's\nobvious that you're no ordinary Joe.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Listen, pal.\nIf you're intending to travel some more,\nyou might want to stock up on supplies\nhere.[dialogue_end]
WILLIE: What are you saying?\nYou're joshing, right?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Listen, pal.\nIf you're intending to travel some more,\nyou might want to stock up on supplies\nhere.[dialogue_end]

WILLIE: Tch...\nWiped out.\nI still need seasoning.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Well, since I found them, I may just\nas well put them out with the rest of\nmy merchandise.\c[speechbubble]: If you need some more, well, how\nabout buying them from me?[dialogue_end]
WILLIE: But, yeah, you're tough.\nReal tough.\nYou did a real number on us.\cWILLIE: Hey, I know.\nWhy not test your skills in PHENAC\nCITY?\nIt's out west of here.\cWILLIE: You'll find trainers who are\nway better than me there.\nYou should go out there and get some\nbattling in.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Heheheh, yeah.\nAnd we bagged ourselves a great big\ncatch, too.\c[speechbubble]: Boss'll be sure to fix us up good with\nbig rewards, too.\nHeheheh, it doesn't get any better than\nthis![dialogue_end]
WILLIE: So, what do you say?\nLet's you and me have a quick battle!
[speechbubble]: Hey, do you know about\nTEAM SNAGEM?
[speechbubble]: They're a seriously nasty lot!\c[speechbubble]: There's no telling how many trainers\nhave suffered at their hands.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: You're a POKéMON trainer, too,\naren't you?
[speechbubble]: They're a bunch of heartless crooks.\nThey rip off POKéMON from trainers\nwithout any hesitation.\c[speechbubble]: I hear they use something called\na SNAG BALL to catch POKéMON from\ntheir rightful trainer in battle.\c[speechbubble]: I'm guessing that you're a trainer.\nYou'd best be careful.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Heh...\nI can tell.\nAnd you're good.\nI can see it in your eyes.\c[speechbubble]: I bet your POKéMON are impressive,\ntoo.\c[speechbubble]: If the opportunity ever arises,\nI'd like to have a battle with you.\c[speechbubble]: Heh...\nThough I doubt I'd have any chance\nof beating you.[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: You know, I don't quite understand\nwhat happened, but having your hideout\nblow up on you...\nCrime doesn't pay, I guess.\c[speechbubble]: I live a crime-free life, so nothing's\ngoing to blow up on me.\nWahaha![dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: How did you like it?\nWasn't it a very beautiful town?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I watched you from here.\nMy, aren't you and your POKéMON\nstrong!\c[speechbubble]: Watching you bedazzled me.\nWhy, if I were ten years younger,\nI'd grab hold and wouldn't leave\nyour side![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, my!\nI'm quite surprised!\nYou've already gotten yourself\na girlfriend![dialogue_end]

[Rui]: Oh, please, stop it!\nGiggle...[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Okay, PIKACHU!\nWe haven't battled this much in a while!\nLet's keep focused![dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Tsun tsun![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Subo suboboh![dialogue_end]

[unknown_3D][Player] obtained a MASTER BALL![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What is all the uproar outside?\nHow am I supposed to enjoy my\nshopping with all that noise?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Pardon me...\nDo you know of MT. BATTLE?
[speechbubble]: Why, yes.\nIt should be common knowledge among\ntrainers.[dialogue_end]

EAGUN: I'm fine.\nBut my partner![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Ah, you're safe!\nGood, good.\nYou battled with honor.\cEAGUN: If your opponent was any\nordinary POKéMON, you would have\nwon.\nSo, that was a SHADOW POKéMON...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah! It's EAGUN's beloved\n[Rui]!\c[speechbubble]: Or was it [Rui]'s beloved\nEAGUN?\nNow, which are you?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Although you may ask why we are\nhere, we simply cannot answer that.\c[speechbubble]: I can see that you are a senior\ncitizen, but I cannot allow you to\ninterfere with our affairs.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah, you're EAGUN's beloved\nBELUH!\nNo, wait...\nWho did you say you were?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah, you're EAGUN's beloved\nTORCHIC!\nNo, wait...\nWho did you say you were?\c[speechbubble]: What's that? You wanted to ask\nme, SENILOR, about CELEBI?\cSENILOR: Have no fear. No problem!\nForget something that important?\nThat's not going to happen!\cSENILOR: Let me start with the\nRELIC in the RELIC FOREST.[dialogue_end]
SENILOR: To meet CELEBI directly,\nyou must use an item called the\nTIME FLUTE.\cSENILOR: That is all one needs to\nbring CELEBI to the RELIC FOREST.\cSENILOR: CELEBI will surely cause\ndarkness to flee from the hearts of\nany POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ahahah.\nNow, now.\nSomeone so old shouldn't overdo it.[dialogue_end]
SENILOR: I see...\nCome see me anytime, WURMPLE.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah, a creaky old POKéMON to go\nwith an ancient trainer.\nHow fitting.[dialogue_end]
SENILOR: According to ancient lore,\nthe RELIC is said to hold the power\nof time travel for CELEBI.\cSENILOR: That mystical power is said\nto revive the most pleasant, most\nenjoyable memories of POKéMON.\cSENILOR: Would you like to hear\nmore?
SKRUB: Fu...\nDidn't I already say?\nAn old man shouldn't overdo it.[dialogue_end]
SENILOR: To meet CELEBI directly,\nyou must use an item called the\nTIME FLUTE.\cSENILOR: That is all one needs to\nbring CELEBI to the RELIC FOREST.\cSENILOR: CELEBI will surely cause\ndarkness to flee from the hearts of\nany POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
SKRUB: Ah...\nNow here's someone who may show\nme a more enjoyable time.\nVery well. En garde![dialogue_end]
SENILOR: I see...\nCome see me anytime, MUDKIP.[dialogue_end]
SKRUB: I should have declined![dialogue_end]

SENILOR: According to ancient lore,\nthe RELIC is said to hold the power\nof time travel for CELEBI.\cSENILOR: That mystical power is said\nto revive the most pleasant, most\nenjoyable memories of POKéMON.\cSENILOR: Would you like to hear\nmore?
SKRUB: I had been instructed to\ncapture CELEBI, then destroy the\nRELIC STONE, but matters have not\ngone according to plan.\cSKRUB: I shall have to immediately\ninform DAKIM, who has gone to\nMT. BATTLE![dialogue_end]

EAGUN: You've finally arrived.\nWhat held you up?[dialogue_end]

EAGUN: But why would anyone want\nto harm [Rui]?[dialogue_end]

EAGUN: SHADOW POKéMON?!\nWhat on earth is that?[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: What?!\nWho were they?[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: That's enough talk!\nIt can wait!\nI'm off![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Oh, oh, oh!\nWhen I looked into your eyes...\nExcitement boiled over in my blood!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What do you say, kiddo?\nHow about we have a heated battle,\nyou and I?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh... But...\nDon't be that way.\nIt's not often that I get the urge\nmuch these days...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Very well!\nI will give you a close look at the\nskills I have honed over all these\nyears.[dialogue_end]
SKOF: Ah, that was a good workout![dialogue_end]
SKOF: Whew!\nMy, you are tough!\nI haven't been this excited in years.\cSKOF: In the distant future, you will\nbe certain to be welcomed as a new\nvillager.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Help!\nThere's trouble![dialogue_end]
SKOF: Whew!\nMy, you are tough!\nI haven't been this excited in years.\cSKOF: However...\nThe POKéMON you use appear to be\ntroubled somehow.\cSKOF: They are frighteningly strong,\nbut they are somehow cold.\nAm I imagining that they are keeping\ntheir hearts closed tight?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I've given up on battling, but I\nnever neglect checking the health\nof my POKéMON.\c[speechbubble]: Gah! Owowow...\nM-My back!\c[speechbubble]: Hmm...\nIt seems that I should be the one\ngetting my health checked!\nWahahah![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What is that unseemly ruckus?\nIt's important that a trainer always\nremain calm.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What, what?\nWhat is happening?!\nMy excitement's boiling over again![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Gasp, gasp...\nEAGUN, it's a serious situation!\nSome outsiders went into the RELIC\nFOREST.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Health check all clear!\nMy TREECKO is as healthy as ever!\c[speechbubble]: Though it's impossible to tell by\nlooking, this TREECKO is older than I.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's the first time that anything\nlike this has happened here.\nIt makes my pulse quicken with\nexcitement.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Urgh!\nI can feel my blood pressure rising!\nNot good![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I... I don't know...\nThey shoved me aside and...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah.\nSo you've been to MT. BATTLE.\c[speechbubble]: When I was younger, I toiled as\na trainer at MT. BATTLE.\nIt brings back memories.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing you reminds me of\nmy own wild youth.\nIt causes my pulse to quicken with\nexcitement.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Perhaps I should train again\nat MT. BATTLE.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah.\nSo you've been to THE UNDER.\c[speechbubble]: When I was younger, I toiled in\nthe mines of THE UNDER.\nIt brings back memories.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Health check all clear!\nMy TREECKO is as healthy as ever!\c[speechbubble]: You should get in the habit of\nnever skipping daily health checks\nof your POKéMON.\nWahahah![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Ah, [Rui].\nYou've finally arrived.\nOh, and you're with a friend, too.\c[speechbubble]: I know it's hardly any of my\nbusiness, but it pays to choose your\nfriends carefully.\nHahahah![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, [Rui].\nHave you gone to see EAGUN yet?\c[speechbubble]: I beg your pardon?\nIntruders in the RELIC FOREST?\nThat's serious![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: SENILOR?\nOh, right, you wanted to see my dad.\c[speechbubble]: He's been getting pretty forgetful\nlately, though.\nI'm afraid he might not be much help\nto you.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: My old pa, he remembers about\nCELEBI a whole lot, but not much\nelse.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I've heard that the thugs that\nharassed the village used a strange\nPOKéMON.\nIs that true?\c[speechbubble]: Isn't there some way of restoring\nthat strange POKéMON to its natural\nstate?[dialogue_end]
SENILOR: To meet CELEBI directly,\nyou must use an item called the\nTIME FLUTE.[dialogue_end]
SENILOR: I see...\nCome see me anytime, TREECKO.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This place is a retirement village\nfor senior citizens.\nBut for some reason, we see a lot\nof visiting young trainers.\c[speechbubble]: There seems to be a rumor that\nthis village has a secret-but-sure\nway of becoming close to their\nPOKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: It sounds like a big group of people\ncame to the village again.\nAre they tourists, I wonder?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That big group of outsiders weren't\ntourists, they were criminals?\c[speechbubble]: I don't like the idea that the village\nis becoming famous even among crooks.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This place is a retirement village\nfor senior citizens.\nBut for some reason, we see a lot\nof visiting young trainers.\c[speechbubble]: There seems to be a rumor that\nthis village has a secret-but-sure\nway of becoming close to their\nPOKéMON.[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: I'm sorry, dear.\nBut I couldn't very well let them\nhave their way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For the first time in decades\nI went to MT. BATTLE for training.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've managed to polish my\nbattle technique there.\nLet my POKéMON and I show you\nhow we've improved![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Hmm...\nSorry to disappoint you.[dialogue_end]
SKOF: For the first time in decades\nI went to MT. BATTLE for training.\cSKOF: I've managed to polish my\nbattle technique there.\nLet my POKéMON and I show you\nhow we've improved![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: While she's looking, you\nmight try gathering more information\non CELEBI, [Rui].[dialogue_end]
SKOF: This is what being young is\nall about![dialogue_end]
SKOF: Whew!\nMy, you sure are tough!\nYou are a fantastic trainer!\cSKOF: In the distant future, you will\nbe certain to be welcomed as a new\nvillager.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: That is the SMALL TABLET\nthat has been passed down through\nour family over many generations.\nExamine it.[dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]There is a bed.\nWould you like to take a rest?
EAGUN: The RELIC must have some\neffect on SHADOW POKéMON.\cEAGUN: I will leave that for you to\ndetermine for yourselves.[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: MT. BATTLE is to the northeast.\nYou can see it in the distance once\nyou leave the village.\nHurry, [Rui]![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Kiih![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Kiih![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Kiih![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Kiih![dialogue_end]




EAGUN: MT. BATTLE is to the north.\nYou can see it in the distance once\nyou leave the village.\nHurry, [Rui]![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Ah, [Rui]!\nAnd [Player]!\nIt's good to see you back!\cEAGUN: So, how goes it?\nHave you trounced the cretins that\nraided MT. BATTLE?
EAGUN: Ahahah.\nYou shouldn't joke that way.\cEAGUN: So, how goes it?\nHave you trounced the cretins that\nraided MT. BATTLE?
EAGUN: I expected nothing less of\nmy own granddaughter!\nAnd, of course, [Player]!\cEAGUN: Hmhm... I see!\nSo VANDER conferred the TIME FLUTE\nupon you.\cEAGUN: Then, what are you waiting\nfor?\nDepart for the RELIC FOREST and\nsummon CELEBI at once.\cEAGUN: I wonder what will happen.\nI find it quite exciting.[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Oh, you'd already summoned\nCELEBI?\cEAGUN: You should tell me these\nimportant things first...[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Ah, yes!\nThere's something I'd forgotten!\cEAGUN: [Player], may I have the\nnumber of your PD...uh...thing.[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Good.\nI'll try to reach you at this number\nif anything happens.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bawoo![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: This makes us pen pals!\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bawoorooroo![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: It would be useful if one could\nsummon CELEBI whenever one desired.\nBut that, of course, isn't possible.\cEAGUN: Luckily, as it is inscribed on\nthe SMALL TABLET, the RELIC in the\nRELIC FOREST is imbued with CELEBI's\npower.\cEAGUN: If a SHADOW POKéMON is\nready to throw open its heart's door,\nyou must visit the RELIC.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bawoo![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Ah, [Rui]!\nAnd [Player]!\nIt's good to see you back!\cEAGUN: I'm sorry I haven't sent you\nany e-mail even though I asked for\nyour P★DA number.\cEAGUN: That's what happens when\nyou get old; you lose the aptitude\nfor gadgets...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bawoo![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Wait a second...\nCould it be?\n[Rui], is that you?\nI thought so!\c[speechbubble]: The last time I saw you, you were\nthis little tiny thing.\nNow look at you!\nGrowing up to be a real beauty![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: But I shouldn't keep you.\nEAGUN was worried about you.\nDon't waste any time; you should go\nsee him.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Let me tell you, I've never seen\nEAGUN run quite so fast as he just\ndid.\c[speechbubble]: I would say that he could even\noutrun me.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh?\nYou're off to MT. BATTLE now?\c[speechbubble]: Good, good!\nWhen you're young, you should train\nas much as possible and gain plenty\nof experience.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hmmm...\nI wonder what that's all about...\c[speechbubble]: Oh, hello.\nA little while ago, someone built\nwhat looks like a laboratory out in\nthe desert.\c[speechbubble]: It makes me wonder what anyone'd\nwant to be studying out there.\nI mean, there's nothing out there\nbut sand.[dialogue_end]
PIKACHU: Biggaah![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bi... Biggaah![dialogue_end]

EAGUN: Ah, [Rui]!\nAnd [Player]!\nIt's good to see you back!\cEAGUN: I sent you an e-mail.\nI'm quite proud of myself for that![dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Oh? Is that so?\nThat's odd...\cEAGUN: Well, since you're here, it\nwould be just as well to tell you in\nperson.\nHohoho.\cEAGUN: I have a little something I'd\nlike [Player] to have.\nPlease, take this.[dialogue_end]
EAGUN: Now, [Player], [Rui],\nit's time for you to go.[dialogue_end]

I know why you're back!\nYou came to introduce your boyfriend\nto EAGUN, didn't you?\c[speechbubble]: Well, [Rui], I should\nintroduce my boyfriend to you.\c[speechbubble]: You see?\nMy boyfriend is this MIGHTYENA here!\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What is this I'm hearing about\nsome criminals going into the RELIC\nFOREST?\c[speechbubble]: Well, isn't that frustrating!\nIf I was a little younger, I'd go after\nthem with my MIGHTYENA...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: When I was still a young lass,\nI learned how to battle from EAGUN.\c[speechbubble]: Back then, EAGUN cut quite the\ndashing figure.\nWhy, he was most popular with the\ngirls, this charming man.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: My MIGHTYENA wouldn't listen to\na word that I said at the start.\c[speechbubble]: But it gradually grew more and\nmore obedient the more we battled.\c[speechbubble]: If you want to become friendly\nwith your POKéMON, there's nothing\nbetter than battling.[dialogue_end]
BELUH: Ah, [Rui]!\nWelcome, welcome!\cBELUH: We heard that you were\ncoming, but then you didn't arrive.\nWe were worried about you, dear.[dialogue_end]
BELUH: Oh, how frightful.\nThank you so much for saving our\ngranddaughter.[dialogue_end]
BELUH: Outsiders fouling the\nRELIC FOREST...\nThat mustn't happen.\cBELUH: But I worry for my husband\neven more so.\cBELUH: [Rui], dear!\nPlease, go after him![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boo!\nFufufu!\nScared you, didn't I?[dialogue_end]
BELUH: You really had me worried.\nPlease don't do anything so rash\nand dangerous again.[dialogue_end]
KASS: I'm shocked over this loss![dialogue_end]
BELUH: Ah, yes!\nYes, we did have such a stone tablet.\nNow where could I have put it away?\cBELUH: Let me go look for it\nupstairs.\nIt may take time, so please be\npatient.[dialogue_end]
KASS: Little boy, you're shockingly\nstrong![dialogue_end]
BELUH: Ah, [Rui]!\nWelcome home.\nI've finally found the SMALL TABLET.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Soh ～![dialogue_end]
BELUH: I hope that SMALL TABLET\nis something useful to you.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Soh ～![dialogue_end]
BELUH: [Rui], you poor\ndears...\nNo time to even properly rest.\nIt hardly seems fair...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Soh...![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Soh...![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What's all the commotion about?\nIs it a track meet for the old folks?\nGee, they're energetic![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: No, really?\nEAGUN, the mythical trainer, took on\nsome bad guys in battle?\c[speechbubble]: Oh, I wish I could've seen that!\nHe must have some strong POKéMON.\nIt must have been a sight to see![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I've made up my mind to stay in\nthis village for a while longer.\nI'm going to study POKéMON and\nbattling in depth.\c[speechbubble]: I would love to meet EAGUN, the\nmythical trainer.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been studying about\nPOKéMON and battling here.\nI'm beginning to understand a lot\nmore about them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll show you what I've\nlearned![dialogue_end]
DURY: I haven't studied enough?![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This is the entrance to the RELIC\nFOREST.\nThey say that CELEBI visits this\nforest.\c[speechbubble]: I'm sorry, but no one except the\nvillagers are allowed through.\nIf you're sight-seeing, please do it\nelsewhere.[dialogue_end]
DURY: Hoo boy, you're strong.\nWhere do you study?\cDURY: You know, I bet you'd win at\nthe PHENAC STADIUM.\nI guarantee it![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Leave your POKéMON with the\nDAY-CARE LADY in the village.\nMost POKéMON will come back in\na much happier state of mind.\c[speechbubble]: You should give her a try.\nLeave a POKéMON with her and see\nhow it likes her.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Eh? RELIC FOREST?\nYou've come the wrong way.\c[speechbubble]: If it's the RELIC FOREST you want,\nmake your way down the hill beside\nthe POKéMON CENTER.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Have you heard?\nIt's quite amazing!\nEAGUN and his PIKACHU drove away\nsome rotten criminals.\c[speechbubble]: He may be old, but I'm guessing\nthat he hasn't lost his touch.\nThe man's to be admired![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Leave your POKéMON with the\nDAY-CARE LADY in the village.\nMost POKéMON will come back in\na much happier state of mind.\c[speechbubble]: You should give her a try.\nLeave a POKéMON with her and see\nhow it likes her.[dialogue_end]

BELUH: Sorry, dears.\nI still haven't found it.\nNow where could I have put it?\cBELUH: I'll be sure to find it.\nJust be patient, please.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bigga bigaah...[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: No, forget about it.\nYou're not going on any farther.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Bigga bigaah...[dialogue_end]
SILTON: Roadblock attempt failed![dialogue_end]
SILTON: Aww, phooey!\nI'm not feeling well today![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Why, welcome to AGATE VILLAGE.\c[speechbubble]: This village is home to trainers who\nwere once considered experts, and of\ncourse their POKéMON.\c[speechbubble]: I would think that it's too early for\nyou people to settle here.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: An odd-looking bunch went off\ntowards the forest.\c[speechbubble]: I think EAGUN set off after them\ninto the forest...\nWhat on earth is going on?[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Subaba...![dialogue_end]
SENILOR: Ah!\nThat's it, that is it!\nYou already have it!\cSENILOR: That is all one needs to\nbring CELEBI to the RELIC FOREST.\cSENILOR: CELEBI will surely cause\ndarkness to flee from the hearts of\nany POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
SENILOR: According to ancient lore,\nthe RELIC is said to hold the power\nof time travel for CELEBI.\cSENILOR: That mystical power is said\nto revive the most pleasant, most\nenjoyable memories of POKéMON.\cSENILOR: If only it worked on me\nand brought back memories of my\nyouth.\nHohoho.\cSENILOR: Would you like to hear\nmore?

[speechbubble]: Did you hear?\nThe enemy even knocked off Lady\nVENUS.\c[speechbubble]: That makes three out of the big\nfour ADMINS gone.\nWhat's going to become of CIPHER?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Did you hear?\nThe enemy's gone and taken down\neven Master EIN.\c[speechbubble]: Were CIPHER's ADMINS all really\nweak?\nOr is the enemy trainer too strong?\nWhich could it be?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hmm...\nI'm sorry, but you don't have enough\nmoney.\nWe do run a business here.[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: This is most peculiar...\nTHE UNDER TIME should be on TV by\nnow.\c[speechbubble]: I don't care to watch it, of course,\nbut you know how guests can be.[dialogue_end]
VENUS: Eek! Eek!\nOh, why did you have to chase me\nhere?!\nIt's so unfair!\cVENUS: ...Tch. This isn't good.\nI can't lead them to the LAB...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, my VENUS...![dialogue_end]

SILVA: [Player]!\nIt's me, SILVA!\nFrom DUKING's?\cSILVA: I discovered that they were\nbringing SHADOW POKéMON to PYRITE\nfrom here.\cSILVA: That's as far as I got\nwhen they caught me like this...\cSILVA: But I did manage to filch this\nfrom them.\nHere you go.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: This is most vexing...\nTHE UNDER TIME hasn't come on the\nair at all.\c[speechbubble]: Personally, I don't miss it, but our\nguests demand it.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: And that was Lady VENUS!\nLadies and gentlemen, boys and\ngirls, thank you for watching. Please\ndo tune in again![dialogue_end]
SILVA: I think it's an item that's useful\nonly down here in THE UNDER.[dialogue_end]
VENUS: Ohohoho!\nYou are so easy to dupe!\cVENUS: See?\nThe KEY for the SHADOW LINER\nis right here.\cVENUS: You didn't think I would really\nlet you take our train?\nBeh!\cVENUS: Bye-bye, and this time I\nmean it!\nDon't you dare forget about me![dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Lady VENUS is THE UNDER's...\nNo! She's my idol!\c[speechbubble]: For Lady VENUS, I could do\nanything!\c[speechbubble]: But even though I'm so near to her,\nI've not seen even a glimpse of her\nin person.\nOh, it hurts deeply![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: For Lady VENUS, I could do\nanything!\c[speechbubble]: What?!\nLady VENUS is no longer with us?!\c[speechbubble]: Gwaaaah!\nI can't do anything![dialogue_end]
[unknown_3D]Hand over the STEEL TEETH to the\nold man?

NETT: Hi, I'm NETT!\nSECC in PYRITE has told me about\nwhat you've been doing so far.[dialogue_end]
NETT: Oh, this is from PERR.\nGreat, this is all that I needed to get\nthe KIDS GRID back up and\nrunning again.[dialogue_end]
NETT: I better explain.\nA little while ago, we somehow lost\naccess to the KIDS GRID.\cNETT: We think it's caused by a jamming\nsignal that's interfering with the\nKIDS GRID.\nIt's probably VENUS's doing.\cNETT: But this POWERUP PART you\ndelivered will let me boost up our\nequipment.\cNETT: When we get the KIDS GRID\nback up, I'll try to hack their\ncomputers for useful data.[dialogue_end]
NETT: Oh, [Player].\nThanks to you, we got the KIDS\nGRID back up and running.\nHonestly, thank you.\cNETT: Huh?\nThe SUBWAY goes out to the SHADOW\nPOKéMON LAB?\nSo, that's how they did it!\cNETT: [Player], you're going to\ngo out to the LAB, aren't you?
NETT: Oh, you can tell me.\nYou're going to the LAB, aren't you?
NETT: For sure, the LAB will have\nimportant data on SHADOW POKéMON.\cNETT: It doesn't matter what it is;\nif you find any sort of data, please\nbe sure to bring it back here.[dialogue_end]
NETT: Oh, [Player].\nHow did it go?\nDid you find any data?[dialogue_end]
NETT: Oh, now this looks interesting!\nLet's scope it out right away![dialogue_end]
NETT: Oh, hey!\nThis DATA ROM appears to contain\na list of SHADOW POKéMON that have\nbeen made so far!\cNETT: Awww, but no!\nIt looks like they've wiped the data.[dialogue_end]
NETT: Oh, [Player].\nDid you read my e-mail?
NETT: Like I wrote in my e-mail,\nyou'll be getting information from all\nsorts of people from now on.[dialogue_end]
NETT: Oh, [Player]!\nI'm finished.\nThe SHADOW POKéMON list is now\ncompletely deciphered.\cNETT: I hope all the SHADOW\nPOKéMON can be restored to their\nformer selves.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I was thinking...\nThe guy next to me browsing... I think\nhe's a spy.\c[speechbubble]: Shhh!\nDon't stare at the guy![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I was thinking...\nThe guy next to me browsing... I think\nhe's a spy.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: The guy next to me's been giving\nme the eye, and keeps smiling at me.\nHe's creeping me out.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Huh?\nHow do you know who we are?[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: But...\nWait...[dialogue_end]

VENUS: Well, a couple mice appear\nto be running loose, NASCOUR.\nBut it's nothing to worry about.\cVENUS: We'll catch them right away,\npulverize, and mash them up.\nGiggle...[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Rush, rush, rush!\nAaaah![dialogue_end]
VENUS: You two...\nYou're holding up the film shoot.\nWe're about to begin filming.\n...Wait, who are you?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Do you have time to hear an old\nman's tale?
VENUS: Aak!\nI recognize those faces!\cVENUS: Those faces were on the\nblacklist from HEADQUARTERS!\nHow did you find us?!\cVENUS: But that's not important now!\cVENUS: I'll squash you myself and\ncollect a reward from Master\nNASCOUR![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: There once was a man who made\na fortune in the mines of THE UNDER.\c[speechbubble]: Where he ended up, I don't know.\nI only hope he used his vast wealth\nfor doing good...[dialogue_end]
VENUS: Now what is it?\nWhy do you keep on trying to mess\nup our plans?\cVENUS: If that's what you want, I'll\nput our battle on the air live!\nEveryone will see you losing to me![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What?\nYoung people these days have no\npatience!\nAlways in a rush!\c[speechbubble]: Well, fine!\nI'll be in a rush, too![dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Rush, rush, rush!\nAaaah![dialogue_end]
VENUS: Aiyeeeeh! How dare you!\nHow could I get bested by a mere boy?\cVENUS: Remember this!\nI'll get you back for this![dialogue_end]
VENUS: Hi, everyone!\nIt's me, your VENUS!\nEveryone's VENUS, that's me!\cVENUS: I have something terribly\nimportant to share with you today.\cVENUS: It's horrid.\nThere are spies right here in THE\nUNDER.\nCan you imagine?\cVENUS: We don't really know all the\ndetails, but if you see anyone\nsuspicious, please let us know.\cVENUS: Everyone, please, I'm counting\non you!\nWe need you to get lots of information\nfor us![dialogue_end]
EIN: Your trust will not be misplaced,\nMaster NASCOUR.\cEIN: Already, sufficient SHADOW\nPOKéMON battle data has been\ngathered from our minions.\cEIN: My masterpiece...\nThe most powerful SHADOW POKéMON\nin history shall soon be ready![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Forget about getting past me.\nI'll protect Lady VENUS from you![dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Hey, you there!\nDon't wander around the set![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, no...\nLady VENUS was knocked down![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: The spies that snuck into THE\nUNDER...\nIt's gotta be you!\nAm I right, or am I right?
[speechbubble]: Hmm...\nIf you're really spies, you wouldn't\nadmit that you are, would you?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Hmm...\nYou're right, you don't look like\nspies to me.[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Oh, sheesh, what should I do...\nI have to make a delivery, but I'm\nstill not done cleaning...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I thought so!\nThis makes things easy.\nPlease, can I get you to deliver this\npart to NETT's house?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Just tell NETT that it's from PERR.\nHe'll tell you the details.\cPERR: NETT's house is the one with\nthe big, rotating antenna dish.\nYou'll know which one it is as soon\nas you see it.[dialogue_end]
PERR: Hi, I'm sorry I asked you for\nthat favor without explaining anything\nbefore.\cPERR: Thanks to you, the KIDS\nGRID is back in operation.\nThanks, [Player].\cPERR: I'll do what I can to gather\nintelligence for you.[dialogue_end]

[unknown_3D]We've just received breaking news.\cAccording to the arrested SNAGEM\nmember, the smaller SNAG MACHINE\nis compact enough to be carried by\na single person.\cWearing this machine transforms\nordinary POKé BALLS into SNAG\nBALLS.\cA SNAG BALL is an alarming device.\nIt can steal POKéMON from their\ntrainers as if they were wild.\cIt is hoped that the missing SNAGEM\nMACHINE will not be used for criminal\npurposes again.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: This is the true power of\ncool![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not like I always win![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: I told you, did I not?\nI'm a veteran.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please don't even think about\nbeating my POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I got a good feel for your\npower.\nI'd call that a great battle.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's wrong here?\nI lost, but there's something missing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The way my POKéMON and I\ncavort and wheel, why, we must look\nlike dancing fairies![dialogue_end]

CAIL: What did you say?!\nYou put the boot to MIROR B.?\nThat's a surprise.\cCAIL: But it doesn't matter if that\nclown's here or not.\cCAIL: Either way, it doesn't change\nthe fact that PYRITE's the town for\nbattling.\nGet ready for this![dialogue_end]
CAIL: I couldn't do it again![dialogue_end]
CAIL: Moan...\nI've learned how tough you are\nbattling.\nIt's a full-body experience.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: People call FATEEN the MOTHER of\nPYRITE.\nHer ability as a fortune-teller is\nhighly regarded.\c[speechbubble]: Why, just a while ago, she told me\nthat the lottery tickets I bought were\nall duds before the draw.\nSob...[dialogue_end]

CALDA: Man, isn't there anything\ninteresting going down?\cCALDA: Ever since MIROR B.'s been\ngone, I've been bored silly.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Lun pappah![dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Oh?\nYoohoo, you two there.\nWhere are you bound in such haste?[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Ahhhhh...\nI might be imagining it, but the town's\nair feels somewhat less dirty.\cFATEEN: But not all is well.\nI can feel the presence of black auras\ncoming from SHADOW POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: There is but nothing that\neludes the notice of my fortune-telling.\nFwofwofwo.\cFATEEN: The key to freeing POKéMON\nfrom that black aura...\nIt is in the north.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Fwofwofwo.\nThat being north may be no mere\ncoincidence.\nYour answer may be there.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: The key for lifting the black\naura from POKéMON...\nIt appears to be in the north.\cFATEEN: You should visit AGATE\nVILLAGE where the girl's grandfather\nlives.[dialogue_end]
REHAN: Urk! Crashed out![dialogue_end]

SILVA: M-MIROR B.!\nYou cowardly cheat![dialogue_end]
SILVA: Urrggh...\nI got creamed by the guy who was\nguarding the cave's entrance...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Drat.\nIt sounds like you can't get one of\nthose awesome POKéMON if MIROR\nB.'s not around.\c[speechbubble]: I'll just have to toughen up my\nPOKéMON with the TMs you get for\nwinning challenges, so it can beat\nthose awesome POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi there, aren't you the hottie?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll go easy on you.\nCome on![dialogue_end]
EMOK: You got all serious![dialogue_end]

[Player] gave DUKING the P★DA\nnumber.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What? Could it be true?\nYou drove MIROR B. out?\c[speechbubble]: This will restore PYRITE to its\nformer glory as a noble town of rogues\nand scoundrels![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: When I was young, I was a noble\nrogue myself.\c[speechbubble]: Back then, I would engage in battles\nwith reckless abandon almost daily.[dialogue_end]
DUKING: [Player]!\nPLUSLE![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: That's why we're here.\nWe came to rescue PLUSLE.[dialogue_end]

DUKING: Hm, what's that, PLUSLE?\nFeeling hungry out of relief?\nWahahah![dialogue_end]
DERID: But...\nThis is ridiculous![dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Imagine seeing you here again!\nThere must be a bond between us!\nHere we go![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Oh, that's too bad, then.\c[speechbubble]: The next time you need to stay\na night, make sure it's right here at\nthe PYRITE SUPER GRAND HOTEL.[dialogue_end]
DERID: Who needs a bitter bond like\nthis![dialogue_end]
SECC: Okay... Good.\nThis should do...[dialogue_end]
SECC: Hmm...\nThis is weird.\nI've lost contact with the kids in\nTHE UNDER.[dialogue_end]
DERID: There must be a nicer\nencounter waiting to happen for me![dialogue_end]
SECC: Okay... Good...\nKeep this up and...[dialogue_end]
SECC: Okay... Good...\nKeep this up and...[dialogue_end]

Get away from me!\nI told you!\nI don't have any money for the likes\nof you!\c[speechbubble]: What?\nYou're not trying to shake me down?\nAnd MIROR B.'s gone?!\c[speechbubble]: If that's true, it's a great cause\nfor celebration.\nBut it's also true that I don't have\nany money![dialogue_end]
SECC: Oh, hi, big people!\nDid I surprise you?\cSECC: I upgraded the KIDS GRID\nwith NETT in THE UNDER.\cSECC: You'll be getting lots of e-mails\nfrom now on.\nThey'll keep you busy![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Lately, the thugs haven't been\ntrying to hit me up for money.\nIt's even sort of lonely.\c[speechbubble]: Of course, I still don't have any\nmoney to give.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Lun lunpaah.[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: Everyone was saying they're going\nto make it and talk over it.\nSECC said they are.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: KIDS, KIDS, KIDS ～♪\nGRID ～♪\c[speechbubble]: It's the song for KIDS GRID.\nI wrote it.\nIsn't it easy to learn?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: I'm here, JOHNSON...\nThat story isn't new.\nI've heard about it over and over\nalready.[dialogue_end]
SHERLES: You two have sure done it!\nI just got word from one of DUKING's\npeople.\cSHERLES: So, you wiped out MIROR\nB. and his gang.\cSHERLES: Thank you.\nOn behalf of our whole town, I want\nto thank you two.\cSHERLES: But there's also bad news.\nHeadquarters warns that there is\na mysterious organization that is\nplotting world domination.\cSHERLES: I don't know if it has any\nconnection to MIROR B., but you\nshould be careful.\nDon't do anything reckless.[dialogue_end]

[speechbubble]: I'm here, JOHNSON...\nThat story isn't new.\nWhy are all your reports so out-of-\ndate all the time?[dialogue_end]
SHERLES: I reckon that MIROR B.\nwas sent by that mystery organization\nin the first place.\cSHERLES: If my guess is true, there\nought to be more of his kind.\cSHERLES: If I hear anything on my\nend, I'll surely let you know.[dialogue_end]
SHERLES: Hmm...\nThose suspects we arrested haven't\nspilled any beans.\nNot a thing!\cSHERLES: I reckon they're afraid of\npayback from their organization.\cSHERLES: I'll be in touch with you\njust as soon as I hear anything.[dialogue_end]

SHERLES: Hi, you two.\nWe blew it...\cSHERLES: Our prisoners broke out.\nEvery last one of them.\cSHERLES: I reckon they realized that\nthey make easier targets for their\norganization when they're caged.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Zzz...\nMutter...\c[speechbubble]: No! Oh, no...\nWe'll lose if you fall asleep!\nZzz...[dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: You can tell us obvious lies,\nbut we are still not going to leave this\nsafe place![dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: What?!\nThat MIROR B. took a loss from you?!\nCome on, how am I supposed to believe\nthat?[dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: Humph...\nSo you beat MIROR B. Big deal.\nThis isn't close to being solved.[dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: Yeah, don't be too proud that\nyou managed to beat MIROR B.\nThey'll make you pay for that![dialogue_end]
TRUDLY: They said there'll be some\nnew prisoners, so they split me and\nFOLLY up.\cTRUDLY: But, you know, the guys in\nthe next cell, those voices sound\nfamiliar.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you looking for DUKING's\nPOKéMON?\nCould it be beyond here, I wonder?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What's that?\nYou ended MIROR B.'s party?\nYou must be some kind of tough!\c[speechbubble]: But I wonder...\nThat MIROR B.... Who was he, do you\nknow?\c[speechbubble]: Might he have something to do with\nthat woman in THE UNDER...[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: That MIROR B., who was he, do you\nknow?\c[speechbubble]: Might he have something to do with\nthat woman in THE UNDER...[dialogue_end]
MELA: Where's that POKéMON?\nI'll never tell you![dialogue_end]
MELA: Don't you people have any\nsense of direction?\nI bet you're having trouble getting\naround in this cave![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh? Oh?\nWhat would make you come out all\nthis way?[dialogue_end]
MELA: I mean, really!\nWhy are you here?![dialogue_end]
MELA: Don't you people have any\nsense of direction?\nDo you mean to tell me that you were\nwandering lost this whole time?[dialogue_end]
REATH: It's okay. After being cooped\nup in that tiny jail, I need a change\nof pace.\cREATH: Come on, we'll have a high-\nintensity battle so I can get some\nproper exercise![dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What's that?\nMIROR B.?\c[speechbubble]: Why would I want something like\nthat?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: What's that?\nWe don't have a CELEBI here.[dialogue_end]
[Rui]: That's amazing!\nWe've got a cute and brave addition\nto our party![dialogue_end]
[Rui]: Oh, that's the POKéMON\nDIGITAL ASSISTANT, or P★DA for short!\c[Rui]: [Player], where's yours?\nYou have to tell DUKING your number\nso he can contact us.[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: Aiyiyi, that's scary.\nTake a look down there.\nIt feels like it's going to suck you\nright in.\c[speechbubble]: Actually, this crevasse leads to\nanother town we call THE UNDER.\c[speechbubble]: Nowadays, almost no one comes or\ngoes from here to THE UNDER, though.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou want to battle me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sure thing!\nBattling fans are always welcome![dialogue_end]
REATH: Thanks.\nThat was ample exercise for my\ndarling POKéMON and I.\cREATH: But if you wanted to battle\nsome more, I'm up for that.[dialogue_end]
DIVEL: Waaah! Whew![dialogue_end]
REATH: It was good exercise, but...![dialogue_end]

REATH: Hey!\nI didn't ask for a battle that intense!\nWe're all exhausted now![dialogue_end]
REATH: Awww, but...[dialogue_end]
REATH: Oh, what a surprise.\nYou came out here again?!\cREATH: Do you really find battling me\nthat enjoyable?
REATH: Oh...[dialogue_end]
REATH: Well, if you put it that way,\nI can't very well say no.\cREATH: You're too strong, but I'll\ntake you on![dialogue_end]
REATH: I should've refused![dialogue_end]
REATH: You really have raised your\nPOKéMON well.\nYou're on the other side, but you're\nstill impressive.[dialogue_end]
REATH: If the rumors are true, CIPHER\ndoesn't sound like it will be around\nmuch longer.\nI'd better go find another job.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: What, you won't?\nThis is DUEL SQUARE, man.\nWhat's the point if you're not going\nto battle?[dialogue_end]
[speechbubble]: If they sold FULL RESTORE here,\nI wouldn't have to carry so much stuff\nwith me...\c[speechbubble]: Well, I guess it doesn't matter.\nI don't have any POKéMON anyways.[dialogue_end]
MIROR B.: Yeah, woot!\nIt's about time, darlings!\nI'm so frightfully tired of waiting\nfor you.\cMIROR B.: Stop the music![dialogue_end]
MIROR B.: Fuhohoho.\nOf course, of course!\nFor you, I'll dance whenever you\ndesire![dialogue_end]
SILVA: Deep beneath this town is\nanother town that goes by the name\nTHE UNDER.\cSILVA: MIROR B.'s mob may have\nbeen smuggling SHADOW POKéMON\nin from there.\cSILVA: I'm going to do a little digging\ninto the underground town of THE\nUNDER.[dialogue_end]

It's no good!\nIt's ignoring orders!
It's no good!\nIt's not listening!
[Rui]: Oh!\nThere's a SHADOW POKéMON!
[some_pokemon_0F] is in HYPER MODE!\nIt won't accept an item!

[some_pokemon_0F] tried to return to its\nBALL without permission!\nBut it doesn't know how!
The SNAG MACHINE is charging after\nuse.\nIt can't be used again right away.
[Rui]: No, wait!\nThat POKéMON doesn't have a\nblack aura!
[Rui]: Oh! [Player]!\nThere's a POKéMON with a black aura!
Oh, no! That one looked like it was\nsecurely Snagged!
Aargh!\nAlmost had it!
Shoot!\nIt was so close, too!
[some_pokemon_0F]'s emotions rose to\na fever pitch!\nIt entered HYPER MODE!
[some_pokemon_0F] is in HYPER MODE!
[some_pokemon_0F] failed to hear!

[Rui]: ...Huh? Whaaaaat?!\nWhy don't you have any POKé BALLS\nwith you?[dialogue_end]
