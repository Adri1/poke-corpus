[unknown2_07_0]KRANE MEMO 1\nRe: The SNAG SYSTEM\cSHADOW POKéMON are victims of criminals who\nuse them for misdeeds.\nThey must be taken from their bad masters and\nprotected.\cThe most effective means of taking such\nPOKéMON from criminals is the SNAG SYSTEM\ndeveloped by CIPHER five years ago.\cIt is an unforgivable act among TRAINERS to\nsteal another TRAINER's POKéMON, but there is\nno other way to save SHADOW POKéMON.\cThe SNAG SYSTEM was originally designed to\nsteal any POKéMON from TRAINERS.\cWe must immediately develop a system that\nsnags only SHADOW POKéMON...and nothing\nelse.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_0]KRANE MEMO 2\nRe: The AURA READER\cIt is impossible for ordinary people to distinguish\nSHADOW POKéMON from regular POKéMON based\non appearance.\cIn developing a new SNAG SYSTEM, our biggest\nchallenge was devising some means of \nrecognizing SHADOW POKéMON immediately.\cWe solved this challenge with a headset device\nthat senses SHADOW POKéMON.\cWe named this headset the AURA READER.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_0]KRANE MEMO 3\nRe: The SNAG MACHINE\cThe AURA READER's development made it\npossible to create a workable new SNAG\nMACHINE.\cWe realized that we could integrate the AURA\nREADER with the original SNAG MACHINE\ndeveloped by CIPHER.\cThe AURA READER can be made to sound\na warning and prevent the SNAG MACHINE from\nworking if a regular, non-SHADOW POKéMON is\ntargeted.\cThe likelihood of the SNAG MACHINE being\nabused should be diminished.\nHowever, one must always be vigilant.\nIt must be treated with caution![dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_0]KRANE MEMO 4\nRe: Purification\cOnce captured, SHADOW POKéMON must have\ntheir hearts reopened in a process called\npurification so that they may return to their\nnormal state.\cThe best-known method of purification was to\nhave the SHADOW POKéMON spend time with\na TRAINER and allow their hearts to gradually\nreopen.\cHowever, because it required SHADOW POKéMON\nto be with the TRAINER, this method placed\na limit on the number of POKéMON that could be\ntreated.\cWe needed a process for efficiently purifying\nmany SHADOW POKéMON.\nOur studies led us to the idea of the PURIFY\nCHAMBER.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_0]KRANE MEMO 5\nRe: The PURIFY CHAMBER\cThe PURIFY CHAMBER is a radical new concept\nthat differs from the usual purification method of\nhaving SHADOW POKéMON be with a TRAINER\nconstantly.\cIt represents a new approach that places\nSHADOW POKéMON among regular POKéMON\nso that they become purified naturally.\cMuch time is still needed to make this concept\nreal.\nWe need to acquire systems, collect data,\nand make adjustments.\cWe eagerly look forward to seeing the PURIFY\nCHAMBER concept in operation.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: It looks like the PSYCHIC\ntype is a tough matchup for you.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You knew how to handle\nPSYCHIC POKéMON![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I should have\ngone easier on you?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish you wouldn't have\nbeen so rough with me.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fwofofofo![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urggggh!\nDarn! Darn! Darn![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mmm, hmm!\nWhat a great feeling![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww, no!\nWhat a horrible feeling![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Weak would be a good\nword to describe your POKéMON.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My poor GRIMER![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The challenger fails!\nThat sound right?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I lost!\nI'll use my ninjutsu to get away!\nJust kidding![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yay![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing a battle like\nthis...\nThis won't do![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Learn from your losses![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good battle![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that it?\nAfter all you did to get here?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, yes!\nThat's the way to do it![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You should make another\nchallenge when you've raised your\nPOKéMON some more.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good job!\nYou've been raising your POKéMON\nproperly![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm the winner by\ninfatuation![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing makes me weak in\nmy knees![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Striking the right\nbalance!\nThat's important![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm floored![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come again, all right?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Grr!\nYou're a tough one![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you find that\nelectrifying?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're so mean to win![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You came here just so you\ncould lose?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew...\nAll right, I lost![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, how about that?\nThanks for your effort. Do come again![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I expected this![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I didn't do the\nright thing by going all out.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gwaaaah![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope I contributed to\nyour training.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're already strong!\nYou don't need training![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, too bad!\nYou came close![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Too much![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you see?\nI'm the model of stability![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ohh...\nYou showed me up![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's time to say farewell![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm done for![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So undisciplined![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Remarkable![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POKéMON aren't final\nevolutions, but you bet they're tough![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I love tough TRAINERS,\ntoo![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The ability LEVITATE is\nuseful, don't you think?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My victory just floated\naway![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you're not what I\nwas expecting.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You beat me?\nThat has to count for something![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's determination that\ncarries you through![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wiped out![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POKéMON returned to\nsnatch victory from you.\nHow did you find them?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: After all I did to get my\nPOKéMON back up to snuff![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I got myself motivated\nand got me the win![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I got myself motivated,\nbut I still lost![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It looks as if this is the end of\nthe line for your skill level.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well played![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The win flew into my\nhands![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, it's so unfair![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You can try all you want.\nIt's all meaningless if you don't get\nthe results![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Not bad![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Despite a valiant effort,\nthe challenger goes down in defeat![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Amazing!\nThe challenger has won![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you're a weakling?\nGee, that's boring.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That was fun, but I lost![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You may be adorable,\nbut there's no leeway in battle.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You look so cute, but\nyou're seriously tough![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, yes.\nThis is how a battle should be waged.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, what's this?\nI lost, it seems.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, yes.\nThank you so much![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nI'm feeling so run-down.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Like a flower, I let my talent\nburst into bloom![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Like a delicate flower,\nmy talent blew away...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I win, everything\ntastes so much better!\nI'd better watch my belly!\nHahaha![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bleah!\nI'll drown my sorrows with some\ncomfort food![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You must be\ndisappointed![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urgh!\nBeaten thoroughly![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, well!\nAdios![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Woaaarrgh![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Rudder hard starboard![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Rudder hard port![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Train some more before\nyou come, okay?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my gosh![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How's that?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Perfect![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That was supposed to be\nperfect![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come again!\nI'll be waiting right here![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wha...\nI lost...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah!\nThat's your best?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urk![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well?\nAren't DARK POKéMON wonderful?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, dear.\nThe DARK type lost.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Victory is mine![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Defeated![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Looks like it's all over\nfor you![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Very impressive![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm strong wherever\nI go.\nEven on a mountain![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Pulverized![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How was that?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Agagagaaah![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm kind of surprised.\nYou're not very strong at all.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yeah.\nYou really are strong after all.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, hey!\nYou're allowed to go all out![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You didn't have to really\ngo all out![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bye-bye![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're joking![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're not going to win,\nif that's the only reason you're in this![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nThat was good![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't cry![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaaaah![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Nice try![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're the real deal![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh!\nYou poor thing![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wah!\nI lost that one![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bingo!\nThe win goes to me![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Swept aside![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the rain of victory\nfall![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wash this away with\ntears of rain...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Like grains of sand,\nvictory trickled from your fingers![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Grr...\nA loss has all the flavor of sand...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well?\nI'm pretty amazing, huh?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Eek!\nWe're done for![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You see?\nWATER, FIRE, and GRASS POKéMON are\nfundamental![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoaaaaaaaar![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I know plenty about\nbattling and MT. BATTLE![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I know plenty about\nMT. BATTLE![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The challenger is down!\nHe finally ran out of steam![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The challenger has won!\nWhat an outstanding victory![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, yeah![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, no![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Winning puts me in a\nsunny mood![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing casts a shadow in\nmy heart![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kaboom![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kaboom![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're still in need of much\ntraining![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Magnificent![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaah! I knew it!\nWe weren't ready![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaaah!\nYou're making me lose confidence![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I feel like I failed my\nschool graduation exam![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I put everything I've\nlearned into that battle![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaaah!\nI couldn't properly use everything I've\nlearned![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's it!\nWe've won![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaaah!\nYou're making me lose confidence![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I feel like I just aced my\ncollege entrance exam![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to need\nremedial lessons![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's it?\nYou're telling me that's the best you\ncan manage?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bravo![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What? I lost?\nI can't go back to the LAIR like this![unknown_6D]

[bubble_or_speaker]: But you're just a kid![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll have to get stronger\nSHADOW POKéMON![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaah!\nI failed to punish you![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing to a boy like\nyou...\nI'll be out on the street begging for\na job![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What, just brute force?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Keep quiet on the shop\nfloor, please![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Knocked aside as if I\nwere a pylon![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I so don't like you![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I lost?\nI'm in shock![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're not supposed\nto win![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gadzooks![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no!\nMy calculations are all out of whack![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Some welcoming party this is!\nIt turned into my going-away party![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I have you beat in chest-\nmuscle size![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You can't have it!\nGive back the SYSTEM LEVER![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GORIGAN![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ugaaaah![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I got the short end of\nthat one![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But...\nThis can't be happening![unknown_6D]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Wha...\nWhaaaaat?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gwaaaaaaaaah![unknown_6D]

[bubble_or_speaker]: You're so much stronger\nthan I expected.\nYou've put the fear in me![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nYou swept me right off my feet![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gyaaah!\nWhat happened?![unknown_6D]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Why couldn't you have\njust ignored what we were doing?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You watch, this town will\nfall to CIPHER one day![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Take it easy!\nDon't be so rough![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, steal our\nPOKéMON, will you?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You have no\nappreciation for our work![unknown_6D]

[bubble_or_speaker]: I didn't count on\nlosing...\nWhat a surprise.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I underestimated you.\nThought you were just a kid.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it all!\nPlayed things too aggressively![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: B-beaten by a punk like\nyou... Groan...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're tougher than that\nsecurity guard at the entrance![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're a little kid!\nYou should lighten up![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You lot!\nDoesn't CIPHER frighten you?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MISS ANCHA![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Why did the elevator\nhave to stop on this floor?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You startled me!\nYou threw me off my battle plan![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's going on here?!\nWhat's a tough guy like you doing here?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Giiiah![unknown_6D]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nI may have lost at battling, but on the dance\nfloor I have you beat!\nFuhohoho![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This POKéMON was too weak![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I shouldn't have done\nsomething this strenuous right after\neating...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tch...\nI get handed the loss.\nI still need seasoning.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tch...\nI get handed the loss again.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whatever the outcome,\nthat sure was harsh![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have we met somewhere\nbefore?[unknown_6D]

[bubble_or_speaker]: My adorable POKéMON will\nleave your team shattered and broken!

[bubble_or_speaker]: Groan...\nYou exposed all my weaknesses.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, punk!\nThe battle's not started, but you're already\nshaking?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, punk!\nYou and your POKéMON couldn't match\nmy intensity![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Trying to intimidate you\nbefore the match didn't work, I guess.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sit back and have a good\nlook at my elegant aerial battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aren't BIRD POKéMON simply\nthe best?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh...\nYou've made me a bird with broken\nwings...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A sphere's the perfect\nshape.\nDon't you agree?
[bubble_or_speaker]: My perfectly spherical\nPOKéMON got me the perfect result I wanted![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My spherical POKéMON are\nperfectly shaped, but this battle's gone less\nthan perfectly![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoever wins or loses,\nlet there be no hard feelings, okay?\nOf course, I will win!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tough luck, kid!\nThat's what a battle's about![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa! I give!\nI lost that one![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you can beat me, then\nyou're the champ...\nHowever, that possibility doesn't exist.
[bubble_or_speaker]: You had no chance of\nwinning against my intellect.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How is this possible?\nMy superior intellect was bested in battle?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, it's time to battle!\nLet's battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Curled up, got on a roll,\nand we got the win![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Curled up, got on a roll,\nand it was all downhill after that![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't matter what\nPOKéMON you have.\nCut their speed, and they're easy pickings!
[bubble_or_speaker]: My strategy is perfect![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urgh!\nMy plan to take away your speed didn't work![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're lucky!\nYou get to see my fabulous combo move!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Pow!\nEverything worked exactly right![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nI thought it was a perfect combo.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll teach you how awesome\nBIRD POKéMON can be!
[bubble_or_speaker]: How do you like it?\nDo you understand how awesome BIRD POKéMON\nare now?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I lost the battle, but do you\nunderstand how awesome BIRD POKéMON\nare now?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I have many kinds of\nFIGHTING POKéMON.\nSonny, can your POKéMON withstand them?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fwohoho!\nHow one commands POKéMON in a battle\nis a demonstration of one's skill![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well done!\nYou have a very good grasp on how POKéMON\nshould battle.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me show you that you\ncan't always win by relying only on brute force.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Exploiting the opponent's\npower to win is a most enjoyable aspect\nof battling![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Why, you little...\nYou've shown me up![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I love rain!\nIt accentuates my beauty!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the rain wash away your\ntears![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I needed more rain to fall![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm a TV weatherperson!\nThis battle's weather will go from sunny\nto a SUNNY DAY!
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's going to be another\nglorious day tomorrow![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nMy emotions are cloudy, followed by rain...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You need plenty of sleep to\ngrow strong and healthy!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good night![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good night![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I'll take it easy on\nyou just a little bit.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I said I would take it\neasy just a little bit.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I lost...\nI should dance to forget.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: TRAINERS who win battles\nhave qualities that let them win!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Winning TRAINERS know how\nto use moves properly![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I lost with my HM move![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Awaken, my POKéMON!
[bubble_or_speaker]: What an eye-opening\nvictory![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What an eye-opening loss![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm always friendly with\nPOKéMON!
[bubble_or_speaker]: My close friendships with\nPOKéMON make me strong![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no!\nLook what you've done to my POKéMON![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me introduce you to\na peculiar world of mystery!
[bubble_or_speaker]: My peculiar qualities made\nyou lose completely![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There was nothing peculiar\nabout that match![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a semifinal match!\nAre you prepared to lose?
[bubble_or_speaker]: The win goes to me![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're special![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm looking forward to\na tasty victory!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you for a most\ndelicious victory![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing doesn't taste very\ngood at all...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't put me to sleep with\na boring battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're so weak, you made\nme sleepy![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think I'll sleep this off...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't care about the way\nyou battle.\nI'll stick to my own pace.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did my overwhelming power\nconfound you?\nWahaha![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hunh? What is this place?\nWhere am I? Hunh?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't matter how tough\nPOKéMON are if they won't do as they're\ncommanded.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nYou're pretty helpless when your POKéMON\nare confused or paralyzed![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm the loser?\nAiyiyiyiyi![unknown_6D]
LOVRINA: Well, what a coincidence!\nImagine seeing you here.\nThis time I'm not losing, though.
LOVRINA: Eek!\nThis time I did win![unknown_6D]
LOVRINA: Boo!\nI can't believe I lost again![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you know what they call\nme?\nThey call me the storm bringer!
[bubble_or_speaker]: I stormed to victory![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn!\nMy feelings are stormy after this loss![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All battles should be\ndecided by one decisive hit!
[bubble_or_speaker]: One-hit KO![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, but...\nI lost.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't you think it's strange\nthat some POKéMON not only change their\nappearance, they even change their abilities?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, there's nothing strange\nabout me winning.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My losing is even more of\na mystery than DITTO's transformation![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I haven't given up on my\ndream of becoming ORRE's governor.\nCome on, let us battle again!
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm number one!\nThe ORRE governor's seat is mine![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My dream!\nMy dream of becoming ORRE's governor![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Isn't it fun trying to figure\nout which POKéMON should battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POKéMON party selection\nfor this battle was spot on![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I ought to have\npicked POKéMON with more special\ncharacteristics.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The key to winning is\nstriking the right balance of heart, skill,\nand body.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your POKéMON party doesn't\nseem to be balanced very well.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I get it.\nBalance alone isn't going to let me win.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There are 17 types of\nPOKéMON.\nBattles are won and lost depending on which\ntypes are chosen.
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's it, I win!\nMy choices weren't wrong![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I put a lot of thought into\nassembling my party, too.[unknown_6D]
GORIGAN: You again!\nThis time, I will crush you and pulverize you!
GORIGAN: That's for wrecking my\nfactory!\nDon't you forget it![unknown_6D]
GORIGAN: Why?\nWhy can't I ever beat you?![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Youngster!\nA spirit of helpful cooperation is what's\nimportant in life!
[bubble_or_speaker]: In life and in battle, helping\none another is important.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How could you beat an old\nman like me?\nDoes the spirit of cooperation elude you?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: One can wage terrific\nbattles by switching the abilities of POKéMON.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well?\nWasn't that terrific?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urgh...\nI shouldn't have relied so much on SKILL SWAP...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A battle is about guts!
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm always upbeat and full\nof energy![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I stay upbeat and peppy\neven after a loss![unknown_6D]
CHOBIN: CHOBIN attack!\nGawrooooar!
CHOBIN: CHOBIN did it!\nCHOBIN wins![unknown_6D]
CHOBIN: CHOBIN lost![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We don't have the SNAG\nMACHINE, but TEAM SNAGEM will last forever!
[bubble_or_speaker]: I won!\nTEAM SNAGEM forever![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I lost?!\nI won't forget your face ever![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is another step toward\nbecoming TEAM SNAGEM's boss!
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd say I'm one step closer\nto becoming the TEAM SNAGEM boss![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My dream of becoming TEAM\nSNAGEM's boss took a beating...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're that brat from before.\nI'll smash you to avenge TEAM SNAGEM's honor!
[bubble_or_speaker]: How do you like it?\nLike how strong I am?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I'm not up to taking\nyou on fair and square...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo!\nIf it's not the punk!\nI'm not losing this match!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gwahahaha!\nOf course I win![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No! Noooooooo![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu.\nYou won't like it if I disable some moves,\nwill you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu.\nDoes losing trouble you?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I could only IMPRISON\nICE-type moves![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The blazing sun is the\nsource of our power!
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POKéMON shine brightly\nin the sun![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've cast a shadow in my\nheart...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let it rain!\nLet it rain!\nBring a downpour!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the rain of victory fall![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I spent too much time on\nmy RAIN DANCE and ended up losing the\nall-important battle![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What? You again!\nHow did you manage to find us here?!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heh...\nYou're surprisingly weak.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Grunt!\nI'm loath to admit it, but you're tough![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My battles are always at\nthe center of attention!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh...\nWinning will make people examine me even more![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hate it when people see\nthe way I lose![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Observe!\nThis shall be a legendary battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to be legendary![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Looks like you're going to\nbe legendary.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll show you how I totally\nnullify the effects of lightning!
[bubble_or_speaker]: You can't consider yourself\na true TRAINER if you can't control the power\nof thunderbolts.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There were other things that\nI needed protection against![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello!\nI'm glad to see you again.\nThis time, let's battle fair and square!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu.\nThanks, I'll take the win this time![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu...\nYou really are tough after all.\nYou're worthy of respect.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm a novice at battling.\nI hope I can keep up!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, I see!\nA battle isn't all that difficult.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see...\nIt isn't quite that easy to win.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello! Glad to meet you!\nShall we battle, then?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, how about that!\nI guess I've won![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess we didn't get loud\nenough to get the job done...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My VENONAT is poisonous!\nDo you have anything with poison?
[bubble_or_speaker]: You certainly had a weak\npoint![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I didn't have any luck with\nme![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Careful!\nTouching my POKéMON will hurt!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sheesh.\nTry to get it together, man.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Where did my victory go?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nHere we come!
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're kidding!\nThere's really someone weaker than me?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's your win![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POKéMON's too tough.\nIt's a lot to handle, I tell ya!
[bubble_or_speaker]: What do you think?\nWhat an unbeatable combination, huh?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww!\nYou took us down![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm not losing!\nI absolutely will not lose!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Nwohoho!\nI'm not prepared to lose yet, not by a long shot![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Noooo![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Youngster, how will you cope\nwith a technician with decades of experience?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fwofwofwo!\nNo youngster will show me up yet![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how could you be so \ncruel?\nShow some respect to your seniors![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no POKéMON under\na truck, maybe you'll just find a MUK!\nDo you like it?\nI'm writing a song!
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm so special!\nI'm good at writing songs and battling![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aiyeeh!\nI can't battle as well as I write songs![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm?\nYou're thinking that you'll win?\nLet me correct you!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, too very bad!\nCome again, now![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'll be!\nYou're pretty darn good![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This battle's with me!\nLet's go!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh!\nWe did it![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww, man!\nI'm not losing next time![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you know?\nOffense is the best defense.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Be bold in victory![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Be furtive in defeat...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Muscles are what POKéMON\nand their TRAINERS should work on!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoaaaah, yeeaah![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I should get in some weight\ntraining with my MACHAMP.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: From my speedy arrival,\nwe'll quickly move to a speedy battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: A speedy victory![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A speedy defeat...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: To win battles, you need to\noverwhelm opponents with willpower!
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're still learning.\nYou won't win often the way you are.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You need willpower to stand\nafter taking a loss, too.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll go to battle with the\nPOKéMON that sailed the seas with me!
[bubble_or_speaker]: The ties that bind my\nPOKéMON and I, that's what let us win![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think I need to go sail far,\nfar away...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Can you feel it?\nWe're in for an electrifying time!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you find my victory\nelectrifying?[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I shorted the circuit!\nBzzzzzt![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll battle until it consumes\nus in its fiery intensity leaving only one!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, that was so hot!\nI'm drenched in sweat![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bleah...\nFlamed out and crashed...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I got up early today so I\ncould prepare for this battle.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you, try again![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urgh!\nI'm going to bed early tonight![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I prefer POKéMON that float\nand sway in the air.\nBut my battle style is solidly grounded!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph.\nMy victory is solid and unshakeable![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Y-you won?\nI feel dizzy and wobbly...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The tempo's off!\nThis won't do, won't do at all![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Dancing and battling,\nthey're not the same, no, no![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, now I'm furious!\nIt's hopeless![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If it's about cutting dance\nsteps, I won't lose![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Woohoo!\nSo I lost![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I can't get into rhythm\nwith you, not at all![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm ready and set to go!\nYou can bring it on whenever!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ooh, I so wanted to\ndance some more.\nBaby, you need to develop a little more\nspine like a good bass line.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I was ready, but not\nenough!\nIt won't be me losing the next time![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Could you soar above my\nelegant dance steps?
[bubble_or_speaker]: My dance steps are\nperfection!\nFuhohoho![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My timing slipped!\nOh, how vexing![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What I call my grooving\nstyle, can you keep up with it?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoah, yeah!\nI'm in the groove!\nFuhohohoho![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That groove wasn't very\ngroovy...[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, baby, it's you\nagain!\nThis time, I'm putting you out of the\ncompetition!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fuhohohoho!\nWatch me scoop the championship,\nbaby![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If this is about dancing,\nyou're not in my league, baby.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, baby, not you\nagain!\nThis time, I'm not going to forgive you!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fuhohohoho!\nMy dancing was perfection today,\npure and simple![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, the tempo is all\nwrong again!\nIt won't do at all![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm your dance partner\nthis time.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you're not quite\nwhat I expected at all, baby.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The tempo is off!\nIt won't do at all![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: With my gorgeously\nelegant dance steps, I'll send you\npacking!
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're not up for the\npart.\nGo practice your dance steps![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My gorgeously elegant\ndance steps aren't easy, you know![unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you are so unlucky\nto have to face me!\nLet the music play!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you.\nYou should face it, you're not ready\nfor me, baby.[unknown_6D]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've beaten me through\nand through and thoroughly, too!\nThis won't do at all, not at all![unknown_6D]
[unknown2_07_0]VARIABLE: This is a temporary message.\nBeware.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We are sextuplets!\nWe are! We are!\nWe strike terror throughout the land!\nFor we are the HEXAGON BROTHERS![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sound off![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: One!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Two!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Three!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Four!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Five![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Wait. Five?\nThat's it? Five?\nAren't we missing someone?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's ridiculously impossible!\nLet me try this time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Count off![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: One!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Two!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Three!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Four!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Five![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nSee! What did I say again?\nThere is someone missing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But anyway, enough.\nHe'll return soon enough, I'm sure.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you brat!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This is no kiddy playground!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We've been away a while, but this here real\nestate's belonged to CIPHER for many a year!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you don't quit scurrying about, we'll have\nto tell your mommy.\nIf you don't want that to happen, then run along \nhome![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That look on your face...\nIt says you're not about to listen and go home \nobediently.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, then.\nI'll play with you to while away the time if you \nwant.
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nBring it on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, then go home![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess it helped to while\naway some time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll take you on as often as \nyou want!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Go on home already!\nOr are you maybe looking to have a battle with \nme?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's do it, then![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Go on home before you get \nhurt![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I get serious, the\nconsequences can be really bad.\nThat's why I took it easy on you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll play with you all you want!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Didn't I tell you to go home?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Isn't that enough already?\nGo play somewhere else.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We might not look it, but we are busy!\nBut, do you want to play anyway?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, then, this is what I'll do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh.\nSo you don't want me to play with you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We try to look busy, but \nactually, we have nothing to do.\nIt's not like we need to worry about any enemies\nin this desert.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, I have lots of time on \nmy hands, but I have no time to play with you.\nDo you want me to play again?
[bubble_or_speaker]: A little kid like you should run on home\nto Mommy.\nThat's the best![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're just a brat!\nWhy are you so strong?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now what?\nWhy haven't you gone home to your mommy yet?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We six brothers are bound\nby brotherly love sixfold!\nOur solidarity is sixfold!\nAnd our food bill is sixfold, too!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come on, kid.\nI'll take you with my sixfold power![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is nothing!\nOur brotherly love is nothing like this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Six!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Seven!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Eight!\n...Wait. Eight?\nNow there're too many of us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm!\nBrothers, beware!\nThere may be spies among us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, look.\nIt's that kid again![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Eighteen![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Nineteen!\n...Wait. Wait!\nWhy aren't the numbers working?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe...\nMaybe there aren't just six of us?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, look there.\nIt's that kid again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, kid, we're not your \nplaymates![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bleaaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hoho!\nSo, you really want to battle with me that much, \ndo you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're pretty tough.\nYou're tough enough that I'm willing to let you \nbecome my little brother.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We six brothers have guts\nsixfold!\nOur energy is sixfold!\nAnd our mistakes are sixfold, too!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come on, kid.\nI'll take you with my sixfold power![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey!\nYou're not supposed to be in here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No running in the hall![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Where do you think you're \ngoing?\nStop that scurrying around![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew, I never thought that CIPHER's big man\nwould deign to show up here in person.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw him in real flesh and blood, and he's\nmenacing!\nThe sight of him gave me shivers![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MASTER GREEVIL's supposedly making\na personal tour of all of CIPHER's facilities.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think he wants to confirm that everything\nis fine so he can proceed with his plans without\nending up with a fiasco like last time.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?! Who are you?!\nYou suspicious intruder![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How long were you there?!\nYou might be just a kid, but we can't let you \nwalk out![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you maybe come to \nrescue KRANE?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't bother trying.\nYou don't know how scary LOVRINA--she's in\ncharge here--can be.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She looks cute and all, but \nshe's nothing short of terrifying.\nGet out of here while you still can.\nIt's for your own good![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm!\nYou again?!\nHaven't you had enough?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aiyiyi...\nI'm only a researcher here.\nI don't battle![dialogue_end]
The door is locked.\cIt appears to need an ID CARD.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Grumble...\nXD001's failure is going to send our plans right \noff the rails...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nI wish we'd finish up with this research and get \nout from this dank underground warren.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wah! Who are you?!\nWhere'd you get in from?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is bad news!\nI've got to alert LOVRINA about this security \nbreach![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Little boy, what are you \nup to?\nYou shouldn't get into mischief when you're \nvisiting someone else's place.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hold it!\nIf you want to pop open that chest, you'll have \nto beat me first![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, PROF. KRANE.\nWhen will you tell me about your purification \nstudy?\nI do so want to know!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That will let me power up my XD001.\nI so made it myself!\nDon't you think that would be fabulous?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've got to be joking!\nI would never cooperate with people like you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, but why?\nI so don't get it!\nWhy would you refuse an offer so wonderful as\nthis?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't care how often you repeat\nyourself.\nI have no intention of helping your SHADOW \nPOKéMON plan.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Artificially slamming shut the hearts\nof POKéMON...\nIt's inexcusable.\nPut a stop to it immediately.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you!\nYou are so mean and closed-minded!\nYou won't even try to understand how marvelous\nit is to help my XD001!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: NAPS![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Yes'm!\nSister LOVRINA![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: This is all so your fault!\nPROF. KRANE is oh so cross because you were \nso rude when you invited him here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You can't be serious.\nListen to the man already!\nHe's been saying all along that he won't help our\nSHADOW POKéMON plan...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I can't hear you!\nThe plan is perfect!\n...XD001's condition was off by just a little\ntiny bit.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Being off by just a little tiny \nbit is enough to make it drop a ship?\nAnd would you look at the uproar...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: NAPS!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's so all your fault what \nhappened, every tiny little bit!\nSo...\nYou so do something about it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...NAPS, was it?\nYou have my sympathy.\nWhat a nightmare it must be to have someone \nlike her as your boss.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You put a lid on it!\nWhen it comes right down to it, it's so all your \nfault.\nCome on, help us with XD001![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: First, we need to talk.\nI'll teach you why it's such a bad mistake to \ncreate SHADOW POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you come here knowing \nthat this is CIPHER's lab?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't matter now.\nSince you know that we're here, we're not about\nto let you go free![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When are they finally going to get that guy to\nspill the beans about that purification research?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He might be the authority on purification, but\nif he won't talk, our work's not going anywhere.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wah!\nWhat are you doing there?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All I want to do is work on \nmy research.\nDon't disturb me, please![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nWho's wandering around here?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nWell, if it isn't a tiny little intruder![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, little boy.\nHave you lost your way?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm?!\nThis is no place for a child to be sightseeing![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Letting in a child like this \nunchallenged...\nWhat is wrong with CIPHER's security?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you heard?\nPrototype XD001's final adjustments are behind \nschedule at headquarters.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If they can get KRANE to \ngive up details about his purification study, all \nXD001's problems should be solved in one fell \nswoop.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think so, too.\nBut he sounds quite obstinate and\ntight-lipped about the whole thing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard LOVRINA's getting\nincensed over this.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?! A kid in the lab?!\nHold still so we can catch you, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm busy.\nI'll let you go today, so go home without \nany fuss, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, what's wrong with our \nsecurity?\nIs everyone asleep at the wheel?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm not good at battling, but \nnow's not the time to be telling you that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll pretend that I never saw \nyou.\nScram already![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Why are you still in this lab?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You understand, don't you?\nIt's wrong to turn ordinary POKéMON into \nSHADOW POKéMON against their will.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, won't you help us \nstop this SHADOW POKéMON plan?\nJoin us, and help us save POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...PROF. KRANE.\nI understand what you're trying to say, but \nI can't help you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa?!\nYou...\nAren't you that kid I saw at the POKéMON HQ \nLAB that time?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]?\nIs it really you, [Player]?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you trying to tell me that\nyou came here by your lonesome to\nrescue PROF. KRANE?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's too bad, I'm still \na member of CIPHER.\nI can't very well let you folks go now, can I?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: As for you...\nYou snagged my TEDDIURSA from me that time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll give you this.\nYou've got guts to come here alone.\nBut I'll fix you good so you'll never get out \nagain![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nPersistent brat!\nYou're back again?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE, you folks\ndon't have the foggiest notion about how big\nand scary CIPHER is.\nIt's not smart to resist.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You can go on about the\npoor abused POKéMON and all, but you should\nthink about your own selves.\nThat's my advice.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nDid you really come here by yourself?\nThat's amazing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But it's dangerous here.\nWe'd better get out right away.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My worst fears turned out to \nbe true about CIPHER.\nThey weren't wiped out.\nThis is just one of their bases.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But the details can wait.\nThings could get complicated if they return.\nLet's get out of here quick![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll fill you in later.\nThings could get complicated if they return.\nLet's get out of here quick![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Hey, you!\nYou sneaked KRANE out?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, wait! Wait!\nI so have not heard about anyone leaving \nanywhere!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're going back to the HQ \nLAB.\nStand aside, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Going back?\nSeriously! You are so joking!\nThis so happens to be where you work from \nnow on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, we so need you to \nkeep working on your studies.\nYou so are the key to our plan.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: XD001...\nThe ultimate SHADOW POKéMON that can never \nbe purified![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Stop that nonsense!\nDo you seriously think that I would help you do \nsomething that horrible?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Little boy, maybe you can \nconvince PROF. KRANE.\nYou should so tell him to study our XD001.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, our plan is to make \nSHADOW POKéMON that can never ever \nbe purified.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: XD001 is only our first \nprototype.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, when we work out the \nproblems, we can make combat units with XD-\nseries POKéMON.\nWouldn't that be just peachy?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But we so need the \nPROFESSOR's cooperation for our plan.\nSo please, sweetie, can you please ask him \nnicely to help?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, [Player]!\nDon't joke around now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Giggle...\nThank you.\nSo you will hand over the PROFESSOR to us \nnicely?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how nasty!\nYou silly boy!\nYou so won't help me with XD001 either?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you'll be sorry now!\nBut you will so understand!\nA little hurt is so persuasive![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], are you all \nright?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey!\nYou two!\nTrying to escape again?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how annoying!\nI so thought you were being good and studying \nobediently!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you so don't smarten up \nright now, I will be angry, like really![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ooh, I so hate to say this!\nLittle boy, I can't beat you right now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: MASTER GREEVIL will so be cross\nwith me, but...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that's okay.\nI'll let you owe me this one time.\nBut you have to promise you will think about my\nplan next time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you see XD001, I'm sure \nyou will so want to help me.\nI'll so be waiting for you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: L-LOVRINA![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you have grown\ntough, haven't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In fact, I'm amazed at how \nmuch stronger you've grown in this short a time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess we'll be relying on \nyou even more from now on, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now that we know CIPHER is \nback, we need to move quickly.\nWe have to come up with ways of stopping them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This time, let's really head \nback to the HQ LAB![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, look.\nThey dropped something.\nWhat could it be?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here, may I see that?[dialogue_end]
[Player] handed the DATA ROM to KRANE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nThis may be something important.\nWe'll take it back and analyze it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What we need to do, Brothers, is this: lock\nand load on this suspicious kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you brat!\nDon't think you can ignore us![dialogue_end]
[Player] used the ID CARD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you tenacious or what?\nI told you, if you want to get at that chest, you \nhave to beat me first![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: LOVRINA!\nThis child here, he's the intruder![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE is so going to\nbe very busy, oh so very busy!\nSo, please be a nice boy and don't disturb us.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Not you again!\nAlways meddling in our affairs.\nIt's your fault I haven't been promoted to \nan ADMIN![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You watch me!\nI'm going to be a big shot one of these\ndays![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There must be something that\nbrings us together.\nDidn't I see you in PHENAC not long ago?
[bubble_or_speaker]: What? You forgot?\nLet me refresh your memory![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, so you do remember![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Haven't I told you already?\nI don't like to battle.\nBut do you want to battle anyway?
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, if you insist![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess you don't like to\nbattle, either.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Can't you see that we're \nbusy?\nWhy, we had to make a trip all the way to \nPHENAC not long ago.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But if you want to play that \nmuch, this is what I'll do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Like I said before, you're \ntough enough that I'm willing to let you become \nmy little brother.\nThink about it, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Being out here, no one's ever\ngoing to notice how cool I am.\nOur only visitor is you, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You know, you're lucky to be \ngetting all that attention.\nI'm just one in a set of six.\nNobody's paying attention to me...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...It's your fault!\nYou made me feel small and insignificant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But even in this desert, my\nbrothers make the loneliness one-sixth.\nThat's the bond of brotherly love we\nshare.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You must think that we're \nhandy playmates, don't you?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bleeaah!\nDon't think we're willing to deal with you \nforever![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, you've gotten pretty \nfamous, haven't you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gee, don't brag about it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, you're surprisingly \nmodest.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Not you again![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well...\nCome visit again, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do we really look that \ndesperate for something to do?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nDon't you dare mock us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Absolutely!\nYou understand us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So, will you become one of \nour brothers?\nTry to pick a good color.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're out playing so much,\nyour mom will worry about you.\nA little kid like you should go on home![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We six brothers are bound\nby brotherly love sixfold!\nOur unity is sixfold!\nAnd our fights are sixfold, too!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come on, kid.\nI'll take you with my sixfold power![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You haven't seen anything of \nour brotherly love yet!\nI bet you're feeling envious![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This time, let's get out of \nhere for real![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waah!\nNot you again!\nWhat do you want with this place?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh... That NAPS!\nHe so must have made a boo-boo again!\nI so have to punish him lots!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You, come with me.\nGo back to your room without any fuss.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What are you doing?!\nLet me go!\nI'll never help the likes of you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\n[Player]![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Five!
KRANE joined your party![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: And, hey!\nIf it's not PROF. KRANE himself!\nHow do you like that for timing?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll seize this chance!\nI'll make the good PROFESSOR tell me about the\npurification study himself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Um... Please?\nPlease tell me about the purification study.\nLOVRINA will be upset with us...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well.\nDidn't we meet at GATEON PORT?\nHave you come to train?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is an excellent place for people to train.\nI've trained here myself.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Back then, I only sought to become more\npowerful.\nI didn't need any other reason.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As a result, I attained this status.\nBut now, I've taken to questioning my motive for\ngaining power.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder what I am fighting for.\nI ponder if I am putting my POKéMON under cruel\nstress...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why I urge you to look into yourself.\nAsk yourself why you want to become stronger \nbefore you take that path.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nYou've come to MT. BATTLE.\nAre you here to train as a TRAINER of \nPOKéMON?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, very well!\nIf you train at your young age,\nyou will certainly become a fine\nPOKéMON TRAINER one day![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you have another purpose in mind?\nYou wish to see VANDER?\nVANDER... Who might that be?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, I remember now!\nI do believe VANDER is an AREA LEADER on \nMT. BATTLE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that's who you want, you should ask\na receptionist in the building.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you begin training in earnest now, you will\nmost certainly become tougher as a TRAINER.\nYou should mount a challenge![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Delcaaaat![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Should I go for it?\nMaybe I'm not ready for this...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm having trouble deciding if I should take\nthe MT. BATTLE challenge or not.\nWhat should I do?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to MT. BATTLE!\nWould you care to take our challenge for \ntraining?\nYou battle till you're knocked out!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Unfortunately, we're not open to the public\nright now.\nThe facilities are closed for training novice \nTRAINERS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou're not here to train?\nYou came to see VANDER, one of our AREA \nLEADERS?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Actually, VANDER is in charge of the rookie\ntraining session.\nHe's inside right now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're in a hurry, you may enter through\nhere.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: VANDER is inside, past here.\nYou may enter through here if you like.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The knockout battles will be resumed once\nthe rookie training session is over.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you'd like, please take the challenge![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Zzz...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You can earn POKé COUPONS even while\nyou're training.\nMT. BATTLE is a cool place![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You can earn POKé COUPONS even while\nyou're training.\nMT. BATTLE is a cool place.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But they're supposed to be training rookies\nright now.\nSo they won't let you take the challenge as \nusual.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to collect POKé COUPONS so I can\nget some new moves for my POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: See that man in white sitting on the bench?\nHe teaches POKéMON moves in exchange for \nPOKé COUPONS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Zzz...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nI just finished training now.\nBut a challenger's already here?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What to do? What to do?\nOh, I don't know what to do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou came to see VANDER?\nSo I wasted a battle on you?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: VANDER is teaching some \nrookie TRAINERS in a ZONE up ahead.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nThe same person came around?\nThe same tricks might not work, though![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm really nervous...\nI wonder if I can make it as a TRAINER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, I hold a POKé BALL in my right hand\nlike this...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, forget it!\nI'll just try it instead of thinking about it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're way too strong to be \ntraining in AREA 1!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou came to see VANDER?\nOh, no wonder!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think VANDER is still \nteaching out here.\nYou may even see him in the next ZONE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi!\nMeeting you gave me confidence as a TRAINER.\nI know what I want to do now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's right.\nIn a DOUBLE BATTLE, it's important that you \nunderstand the attributes and abilities of two \nPOKéMON together.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, VANDER.\nIt makes sense![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nAre you a knockout battle challenger?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hate to disappoint you, but \nwe're not running the challenge right now.\nWe're in training, you see.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nEAGUN sent you to see me?\nOh, to hear about the desert!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Understood!\nI'll be happy to give you my account.\nBut before I do that, I've got a little request.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Just on appearance, you look\nto be an outstanding TRAINER.\nI'm certain my eyes aren't deceiving me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, here's my request.\nTo finish up my novice TRAINER's session,\nI'd like you to treat him to a battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you for training with me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Experiencing a battle in \nperson seems to be the best way to learn!\nMay I have another battle?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes!\nJust as I thought!\nThat was a well-played battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why, it made me want to \njump in and join the fray, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyways, we should talk.\nBut this isn't the place for that.\nLet's go back to reception.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: In the desert south of here, \nthere's a CIPHER research facility.\nIt's been there since the SHADOW POKéMON \nincident.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It seemed to be abandoned \nfor a long time.\nBut recently, I've seen groups of shady \ncharacters going inside.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Shady characters were seen \nat the lab in the desert in the south.\nAre they somehow connected to PROF. KRANE's\nabduction?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There are three rookie TRAINERS in\ntraining now.\nWhen they complete their training, MT. BATTLE \nwill be reopened.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What to do, what to do...\nIt's finally started!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I have to calm down...\nI just have to do everything that VANDER taught \nme![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing twice to the same \nopponent...\nI still need much more training...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Baseball mitt on the left hand,\nPOKé BALL on the right!\nTake that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I bet if I could beat you, I'd \nbe able to become an AREA LEADER one day.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've completed my training as \na novice TRAINER.\nNow, I have to gain as much experience as I can.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Win or lose, it's best to \nexperience real battles![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello!\nYou've come to train at MT. BATTLE?\nThat's excellent!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ever since I saw your great \nbattle against my rookie trainee, I've been \nwanting to battle you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, let's not waste any time!\nI'd like to take a good look firsthand at\nhow you battle![dialogue_end]

MIRU: What to do, what to do...\nIt's finally started!\cMIRU: I have to calm down...\nI just have to do everything that VANDER taught \nme![dialogue_end]
MIRU: Losing twice to the same opponent...\nI still need much more training...[dialogue_end]
CRIDEL: Baseball mitt on the left hand, \nPOKé BALL on the right!\nTake that![dialogue_end]
CRIDEL: I bet if I could beat you, I'd be able to \nbecome an AREA LEADER one day.[dialogue_end]
BARDO: I've completed my training as a novice \nTRAINER.\nNow, I have to gain as much experience as I can.[dialogue_end]
BARDO: Win or lose, it's best to experience real \nbattles![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hoho!\nAre you all ready?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It seems AREA 1 is too easy \nfor someone of your skill level, youngster.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well.\nA TRAINER younger than even my grandchildren.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah...\nA battle is a fine thing, indeed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you prepared?\nThen, here we come![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Youngster, in your case, \nI would think that you could breeze through \nhigher AREAS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: AREA 1 is really only good as\na light warm-up exercise.\nThat doesn't mean you should take anything for\ngranted, though.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess this wasn't even \nworth your time as a warm-up.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: In battle, strategy is vitally \nimportant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good showing!\nKeep it up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to MT. BATTLE.\nIf you manage to beat me, you'll be facing \nVANDER, the AREA LEADER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: VANDER's next.\nYou may coast to an easy win over him, though.[dialogue_end]
VANDER: Oh, hello!\nYou've come to train at MT. BATTLE?\nThat's excellent!\cVANDER: Ever since I saw your great battle \nagainst my rookie trainee, I've been wanting to \nbattle you.\cVANDER: So, let's not waste any time!\nI'd like to take a good look firsthand at how\nyou battle![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: AREA 2 begins here!\nEh, it's still like spring training in baseball.\nAnyway, go, CYNDAQUIL![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: AREA 2's only started.\nYou'd better keep on your toes![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: In battle, it's very important \nto get a read on how things will unfold.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I need to train much, much \nmore.\nI want to become a TRAINER in tougher AREAS \nthan this one.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kid, your POKéMON can't get\naway now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The natural abilities of your \nPOKéMON should be used to your advantage \nin battle.\nDon't forget about them![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Want to get started?\nSEEDOT, LEDYBA, come on out![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I guess I'll be waiting \nfor the next challenger.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm not going to waver from \nmy devotion to cute and strong POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, go!\nGo, RALTS![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A RALTS can have two kinds \nof abilities, SYNCHRONIZE and TRACE.\nDid you know that?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You can't win battles just by \nrelying on brute power![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I won't lose to you at arm \nwrestling![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, you're still so young, and\nyet you are training at MT. BATTLE.\nYou should be proud of yourself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Youngster, I'd say you can \neasily get through to more advanced AREAS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, there.\nI'm ELDOF, the AREA 2 LEADER.\nIt seems AREA 2 is too easy for you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here you are.\nThose are the POKé COUPONS for winning your \nway through AREA 2.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Things will get a little more \nchallenging once you reach AREA 3 and beyond.\nKeep working hard![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's AREA 3 now!\nIt's a different experience than AREA 2![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The way you're going, it \nmight be easy as pie for you to reach AREA 4![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Training together with your \nfavorite POKéMON...\nI'd consider that a state of happiness![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I lost the battle, but I'm \nhappy that I got to help in your training![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you enjoying your \ntraining?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I admire you.\nI love to battle, but I really don't like training \nvery much.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't you think DARK \nPOKéMON are cool?\nAnd ROCK POKéMON, why, they're sturdy and \nsolid!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, sir!\nI sure do like them![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I battle, I like to use \nspecific types of POKéMON.\nThat's my style.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you have any preferred \ntypes?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I am totally devoted to \nGRASS POKéMON!\nI shall be your training partner![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Way to go!\nYou beat me totally![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll take you on with my prize\nPOKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I need to train more.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You are but a child, and yet \nyou are in training.\nMost impressive![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The path before you is a long\none.\nI urge you to keep going.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Can your party overcome my \nPOKéMON's INTIMIDATE ability?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How do you like the pairing of\nMASQUERAIN and CORPHISH?\nQuite the combination, hey?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: THICK FAT and WATER \nABSORB!\nCan you beat that combination?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: TARIA, the AREA LEADER, is \nnext. Don't fail now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello, welcome.\nI'm TARIA, and I'm the AREA LEADER.\nWe'll battle immediately![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here you are, the POKé \nCOUPONS for AREA 3.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now that was an amusing \nbattle!\nI hope you'll keep it going in tougher AREAS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is where AREA 4 begins!\nAre you all ready?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gee, if you're that strong, \nyou don't need any training.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you good at battling \nagainst the PSYCHIC type?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you learn something \nabout battling the PSYCHIC type?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's really great that you \ncame to train here.\nBut I won't go easy on you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Training battles are serious,\nwith no restraint.\nThat's why they're so good![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Youngster, did you know?\nAREA 4 is a garden of beauties!\nFwofwofwofwofwo...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gasp, gasp...\nYou've worn me out.\nYou've ruined my beautiful look, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard that someone has \nthe same combination of POKéMON as my team.\nHave you seen him or her?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHIMECHO and CACNEA are \nso cute!\nI just adore them![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POKéMON is darling!\nLook! Look![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Even foul-smelling POKéMON \ncan be little darlings.\nPlease come visit again![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, don't you think my \nPOKéMON are kind of like ninjas?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I enjoy being a TRAINER, but \nI'd love to be a ninja, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When GRASS POKéMON and \nBUG POKéMON are together, it makes me feel \nlike I'm in a grass field.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You know, GLOOM is \na GRASS POKéMON, but if it's around, that grass\nfield won't be very refreshing at all.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope that our battle will be\nhelpful to you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to keep battling \nmore and more!\nI'm going to get stronger![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, were you surprised that \nI'm a man?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Aside from me, everyone in\nAREA 4 happens to be a woman.\nHahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I can see why you made \nit through this far!\nHere are your POKé COUPONS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Things will get tougher for \nyou as of the next AREA.\nFocus and keep going![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If your POKéMON haven't \nbeen raised properly, you won't win your way \nthrough AREA 5 easily.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's fun to raise POKéMON while\nthinking about their abilities, types, and so on.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't matter how tough \na POKéMON has been raised, my DELCATTY's \nCUTE CHARM will make it completely infatuated![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd better work on my training\nsome more![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My party POKéMON strike \na perfect balance with each other![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My party had perfect balance,\nbut...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our INNER FOCUS and ROCK \nHEAD will shatter any POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I should be redoing my\ntraining, too...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll be wily and hit you with \nsome STATIC shock![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: NUZLEAF's kind of cute, \nisn't it?\nWhy do they call it a WILY POKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's get this battle started![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good going, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good for you to come train!\nNow, come on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It figures.\nYou had what it takes to come this far![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well!\nYou're the smallest challenger I've ever faced![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The TRAINER's size doesn't \naffect a battle at all, though.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You'll get more out of training\nby battling POKéMON of all types.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your next battle is against \nthe AREA LEADER.\nMake it a good one![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you can beat me, you \nwill conquer AREA 5!\nLet's get started![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: I have this thing for the \nGROUND type.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll redouble my efforts to \ndeepen my expertise in the ways of the GROUND\ntype![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Youngster!\nHere we go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You may well be strong \nenough indeed to clear AREA 6.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This AREA is a wonderland of\nsenior citizens!\nI lied!\nHyahyahya![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So young, and yet so \naccomplished![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My first love is POKéMON \nthat haven't fully evolved![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A POKéMON in an unfinished\nstate of evolution is sort of magical, don't you \nthink?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I like POKéMON that hover.\nDon't you think it would be nice to do that?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Five more TRAINERS, then \nyou'll be done with this AREA.\nKeep it up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're something else to \neven get this far![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like to see how far you \ncan go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our VITAL SPIRIT will leave\nyou reeling![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, you beat my POKéMON!\nThat's good work, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come hither!\nMy resurrected POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm raising both a LILEEP and\nan ANORITH.\nDon't you think that's amazing?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's HUSTLE!\nLet us battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's the AREA LEADER next!\nShow a little hustle, challenger![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm the last line of defense \nin AREA 6!\nI, HAMPY, am your opponent![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Very well.\nYou must accept these POKé COUPONS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I would say that you are \nstrong enough to advance to the next AREA, \nbut don't let down your guard![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let AREA 7 begin with \na flourish!\nLet our battle take wing![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wouldn't go around acting \nas if you're walking on clouds just because\nyou've beaten me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo!\nYou're working hard, I see![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Keep slugging away right \nthrough to ZONE 100![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is IDLON of ZONE 63!\nEntering battle now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How far will this challenger\nmanage to go?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Looking good!\nIt looks like we're in for one good battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I can see why you made it to \nAREA 7.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my!\nAren't you a cute challenger![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How about that!\nI guess I'll cheer for you now.\nKeep the drive going to ZONE 100![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When you see a pretty wildflower\nand a butterfly, don't you get the urge to\ndance?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll be cheering you on while \nI dance here with my POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello.\nYou must be tired.\nHow about I refresh you with some rain?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Perhaps I'll have my POKéMON\ngive me a massage with their ELECTRIC moves.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For 80 years I've dedicated \nmyself solely to GRASS POKéMON!\nLet me see what you can do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My love for GRASS POKéMON \nruns deep![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've put on some weight, so \nI've been running here every day for exercise.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder if there's \na POKéMON out there that can reduce \na TRAINER's weight?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm! You've come this far?\nI can't wait to see how you battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That was quite the impressive\nbattle.\nHere are your POKé COUPONS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: With your talent, I'm sure \nyou'll keep winning.\nStay focused![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good going! Welcome to \nAREA 8!\nLet's see if you can string together some wins![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yup!\nYou may have what it takes to win your way \nthrough this AREA![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm no longer on a boat, \nI'm up on MT. BATTLE, but my heart is still out \nat sea![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The challenger has set sail to\nthe next AREA 8 destination![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Want to do some weight \ntraining as well?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I need more training![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't just do weight \ntraining, you know?\nI train my POKéMON, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You don't look like you've \ndone much training, but oh yes you have![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I apply my intellect so that \nwe may battle perfectly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm... Something's wrong.\nMy battle plan should have been perfect,\nand yet...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No one, but no one, can beat\nme when it comes to guts!\nI'll keep battling without rest or sleep![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think lack of sleep caught \nup to me...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Want to go?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I enjoyed that battle.\nSo, that sits fine with me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The forbidden charm of DARK\nPOKéMON...\nWatch![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're good.\nYou'd have to be to defeat my DARK POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah! Haah! Hiyah!\nWe battle now![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: I love POKéMON!\nBig ones, little ones, I love them all![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I sometimes lose sight of my\nCASTFORM behind my WAILORD.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, wow.\nSo here you are in AREA 9.\nYou've got to be pretty tough![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You look capable of keeping \nyour streak going through the last half of \nAREA 9.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bring your best!\nNo fooling around![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's nothing funny about\nyou when you're serious![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nWhat an intriguing challenger![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Ouch!\nDone in!\nBut a good battle that was![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You won't be battling the \nAREA LEADER if you can't beat me first![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You are tough!\nThe AREA LEADER's next.\nHang in there![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You should be proud.\nIt's quite the feat to even reach me at the end of\nAREA 9.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, steel your nerves and\ncome on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'll be!\nI didn't think I'd lose!\nHere are your POKé COUPONS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's sure tiring to be an AREA\nLEADER, though.\nI should take a spa vacation and get refreshed.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you happy when it rains?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I have to admit I don't like \nrain very much at all.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It was quite admirable for you\nto come so far, but I'm afraid your journey will \nend in disappointment in a raging SANDSTORM![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Just eight more to go.\nDon't get discouraged now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll have you know, my \nPOKéMON are quite astounding![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Things will get tougher for \nyou as of the next AREA.\nFocus and keep going![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: With your talent, I'm sure \nyou'll keep winning in the next AREA.\nStay focused![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You had to beat my prized\nPOKéMON to win, too.\nI can see why you made it all the way here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's sure tiring to be an AREA\nLEADER, though.\nI should take a spa vacation and get refreshed.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh, my! You did it!\nYou cleared MT. BATTLE entirely without \nchanging your POKéMON once!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Your talent is incredible!\nWithout thoroughly knowing and trusting your \nPOKéMON, this feat would have been simply \nimpossible![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For your record-setting \nPOKéMON, let me give you these as mementos \nof your training here at MT. BATTLE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They're exclusive RIBBONS \nfor commemorating their 100-win streak at  \nMT. BATTLE.\nYou can take pride in it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Also, I would like you to \nhave one of these very special POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been planning to give \nthem to a TRAINER who has shown me \nextraordinary promise.\nI'm quite proud of them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Here!\nChoose one![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: It took off because you made so much noise,\nGORIGAN, sir.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait a second!\nThat's not what you said![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Allow me to explain.\nWe have a crucial job to do at the LAIR.\nWe need to make SHADOW POKéMON from those\nthat were on this ship.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You do agree this is indeed \nimportant, don't you?\nIf you were to do the job, you would take 38%\nmore effort than I.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In that case, GORIGAN's \nmood would worsen by 72%.\nYou do agree that is indeed most inefficient,\ndon't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As a result, if you were to \ntake this boy on in my place, we would be ahead \n63% in terms of overall efficiency.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You do understand, don't \nyou?\nIt's only for efficiency's sake.\nI'll be going now.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, well.\nIf I don't beat you here, I wouldn't be fulfilling \nmy duties.\nDon't hold a grudge for this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see, so it was a POKéMON down there.\nI'll sleep better at night knowing that!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou want to catch that POKéMON?\nWell, you're a TRAINER, aren't you?\nJust throw your POKé BALLS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Is that right?\nSo it was a POKéMON that a girl asked you to\nfind.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'd bet that POKéMON's scared out of\nits wits being away from its TRAINER and then\ngoing through all this.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why don't you try going up to it nice and\ngentle so you don't scare it off?\nIt's worth a shot.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyways, I'll be able to get some decent\nsleep now.\nThanks to you![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: But that's all right.\nWe'll get back to snagging POKéMON just like\nthe old days and terrify the world again!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: And we'll do that by using\nyour SNAG MACHINE![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey, my friend!\nWhat's that?\nYou still can't get close to that POKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why don't you try going up to\nit nice and gentle so you don't scare it off?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That bunch I saw...\nWeren't they TEAM SNAGEM?\nWhy would they want to pick a fight with you?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had been happening.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right?\nSo that's been happening in the world at large.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM is a bunch of crooks and thugs.\nThey were snagging POKéMON from people with \nCIPHER's help.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hadn't heard about them for the last couple\nyears, so I figured they fell apart.\nI guess not, eh?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyways, it seems to me you need to get back\nthat thing they took from you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think they took off north chasing after\nanother bunch of strange characters.\nMaybe you ought to join the chase, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nYou say that other strange bunch was CIPHER?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sounds like you got yourself involved in\nsomething huge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You went out to ECLO CANYON chasing\nTEAM SNAGEM?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So that lot's up to no good out there,\ndo you think?\nThey're a crude and violent bunch, so you watch\nyourself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey!\nThat machine on your arm!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I get it.\nYou managed to get it back.\nThat's excellent to hear!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But you know, this place is getting too hectic,\nwhat with TV people coming around and all.\nMaybe it's time I left.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: POFTY!\nWe're done with this location shoot.\nLet's get back to PYRITE!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi!\n[Player]!\nCan you say something to POFTY, too?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She's gotten a bit too excited and won't listen\nto me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A ship in the desert!\nDon't you think that's more than just a little \nmysterious and romantic?
[bubble_or_speaker]: That is so right!\nIf there were a handsome guy here, it would be \nperfect!\nGiggle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nHow could you be so unromantic?\nAnd you're so young, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I reckoned I can finally get some peace\nand quiet here.\nSo you can imagine my surprise when a TV crew \nshowed up!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd hate to see this place turn into a tourist\nattraction.\nMaybe I should move on.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm WAKIN of TEAM SNAGEM!\nIt wouldn't hurt you to remember that![dialogue_end]
Oh!\nIs that...[dialogue_end]
The SCOOTER's tires bogged down in the sand!\nIt's impossible to go any farther.\c[Player] had to go back to PHENAC CITY.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I watched you battling those downright-bizarre\npeople.\nYou're some kind of tough, aren't you?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I watched you battling those downright-bizarre\npeople.\nToo bad you didn't win.\nStill, you're some kind of tough.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? Me?\nI just happened to stumble across this ship, so\nI made it my home.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You know, there's plenty of food and all.\nI have to admit certain things bugged me, but\nnothing's perfect in life!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to admit I'm glad that weird bunch\nis gone.\nI owe you thanks for that at least.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You must be tired after that battle, right?\nYou can rest up at my place.\nIt's in the wheelhouse.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well?\nDid you get some decent rest?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're free to use that bed whenever you\nfeel tired, okay?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way...\nI've got this favor to ask of you.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: See, every so often, I hear these odd noises\ncoming from deep in the ship's hull.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think there's someone skulking around down\nthere, but it's too creepy for me to go take\na look-see.\nHow about you go look for me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey, please.\nYou're some kind of strong, I know it.\nYou've got to do this for me!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you kindly.\nThat noise has been really eating at my nerves\nlately.\nI can hardly sleep now!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, when you're done investigating,\nI need you to tell me if you've found anything.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, wait!\nYou're not leaving, are you?\nYou have to investigate the ship's deep innards\nfor me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm counting on you!\nMy good night's sleep depends on this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey!\nSo, how was it?\nWas there anything down there?[dialogue_end]
[Player] described the POKéMON that was\ndeep in the ship's hull.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see, so it was a POKéMON down there.\nI'll sleep better at night knowing that!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Is that right?\nSo it was a POKéMON that a girl asked you to \nfind.\nAnd you say it got away?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, this place isn't a very welcome place\nfor a wild POKéMON to survive in...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why don't you try looking for it in places\nwhere wild POKéMON are apt to gather?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyways, I'll be heading off for home now.\nAfter all, you've solved what worries I had.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm surely indebted!\nCome see me whenever you like.\nYou're always welcome![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When you go investigate, come tell me if you\nfind anything.\nEh, tell me if you don't find anything![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey!\nThanks for helping me out!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't be a stranger if you happen to be in\nthe area!\nDrop in and see me anytime![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, so you finally found that POKéMON you've\nbeen looking for.\nGood for you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been sleeping well since you helped\nme out.\nDrop in and see me anytime![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow.\nI can never get over how tall this place is.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: On top of that TOWER is a COLOSSEUM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd love to take part in COLOSSEUM BATTLES,\nbut I'm afraid of heights.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm supposed to keep quiet about it, but I was\nthe one millionth visitor to PHENAC CITY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, someone in PHENAC gave me a BATTLE\nCD as a memento!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well?\nDon't you think that's lucky?\nI intend to stay around here for some more\ngood times![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is REALGAM TOWER.\nIt's the summit of battling!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's see...\nThere are the COLOSSEUM BATTLES,\nBATTLE SIMs, and BATTLE BINGO!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So many choices!\nI can't decide what kind of battle I should try\ntoday![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm thinking of entering\nCOLOSSEUM BATTLES.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But before I do that, I'll stock up on items at\nthis shop.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: BATTLE BINGO's an exciting challenge.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: How should I say this?\nIt's fun because it makes you think about the\ntypes of POKéMON you may face.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to REALGAM TOWER!\nThe pride of PHENAC CITY, it is a fully integrated\nfacility dedicated to battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: TRAINERS may take part in COLOSSEUM\nBATTLES, BATTLE SIMs, and BATTLE BINGO.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We sincerely hope you enjoy to your heart's\ncontent all that we have to offer.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Also, you can earn POKé COUPONS here.\nThey can be exchanged at MT. BATTLE for items \nand TMs.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm not saying BATTLE SIMs aren't\nfun--they are, but I prefer doing things for real.\nMT. BATTLE's more my style.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me tell you what I'm striving at now.\nA nonstop 100-TRAINER run through \nMT. BATTLE!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't rightly know if my POKéMON or I have\nthe willpower to gut it out, but it's something\nI will do one of these days![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The MAYOR of PHENAC used to drop in\npretty much every day.\nBut I haven't seen him around for some while \nnow.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope he's not sick or anything.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Your face!\nI've seen you somewhere before!\nUm... Where was it now?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I remember now!\nYou were on TV!\nUm... You were with that moustache man!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But you know what?\nYou look better on TV than in person![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: BATTLE SIMs let you experience all sorts of\nbattles using BATTLE CDs.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There are many kinds of BATTLE CDs, from\neasy to tough.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think there are 50 in all, but after that\nbreak-in, most of them were gone from the shop.\nBut, you know...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: PHENAC was taken over?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What kind of nonsense is that?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: PHENAC has a fantastic TRAINER named\nJUSTY.\nWith him around, nothing like that could possibly \nhappen.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nThe people of PHENAC have been replaced by \nCIPHER members?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You mean even that generous lady who gave\nme this BATTLE CD was...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: No! That just can't be true!\nI mean look at this!\nShe gave me something this awesome![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nPHENAC's been taken over?\nThat sounds preposterous...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But if that's true, they may target this place\nnext!\nOh, my gosh!\nThis is serious![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PHENAC was under CIPHER's control?\nReally?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It must have been PRE GYM's JUSTY who\nsolved that crisis!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nIt wasn't JUSTY?\nI wonder who, then.\nIt must have been one amazing TRAINER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I see...\nSo CIPHER's members really were taking the \nplace of PHENAC's people.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That means that generous lady who gave me\nthat BATTLE CD was one of them...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I don't know who to believe anymore!\nSomeone that generous shouldn't be a bad\nperson![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right!\nPHENAC's takeover is finished!\nAm I glad to hear that!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The MAYOR of PHENAC should be relieved![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow.\nI can never get over how tall this place is.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I suffer from vertigo, but I screwed up my\ncourage and went to the COLOSSEUM on top.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I couldn't take it.\nIt was all I could do to stay standing, never\nmind battling![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm totally into BATTLE SIMs now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like to get hold of some new BATTLE CDs,\nbut they're awfully hard to get.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish another nice, generous lady would\ngive me some...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're thinking about entering COLOSSEUM\nBATTLES, you should stock up on items here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should be prepared for all situations![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it...\nI always get beat during COLOSSEUM BATTLES.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I really would like to know what sort of a\nTRAINER is waiting for me at the end, you know?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Your face!\nI saw it on TV!\nYou're the guy who raided PHENAC!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...No, wait.\nYou're the boy wonder TRAINER who sent the\nbandits packing.\nIsn't that right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nYou're surprisingly boyish still.\nMaybe you look better on TV![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What is it with these BATTLE \nCD things?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: POKéMON appear all right, but\nwhen the battle ends, they just fade away!\nYou don't get to keep them?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, sheesh...\nI dropped all my secret savings into them \nbecause I thought I'd get rare POKéMON\nfor real!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There goes money down the\nproverbial drain!\nLet's get out of here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What'll we do with these \nBATTLE CD things?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What good are they if they \nwon't give us any POKéMON?\nJust toss them out somewhere.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome!\nYou may experience BATTLE SIMs here using \nBATTLE CDs.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Unfortunately, thieves made off with a huge\nhaul recently, so we only have a small selection\nof BATTLE CDs available right now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's more, two customers just came in and\nbought up most of what we had left.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, but if you have BATTLE CDs of your own,\nyou certainly may use them for BATTLE SIMs.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please do let me know if you have a BATTLE\nCD you would like to play.\nSo, how may I serve you today?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello!\nWe just added to our BATTLE CD selection!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please do experience BATTLE SIMs![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks for visiting regularly!\nWe've expanded our BATTLE CD selection again!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please do experience BATTLE SIMs![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! I see that you've cleared\n[some_item_2D]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This BATTLE CD actually is double sided.\nOnce you've cleared the A side, you're entitled\nto receive the B side.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The B side reverses the attacking and\ndefending sides in the BATTLE SIM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I do hope you make that challenge![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Those BATTLE CDs are bound to be\nsomewhere.\nI hope you'll work hard and get many BATTLE\nCDs![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that true?\nCIPHER has taken over PHENAC?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, isn't that awfully audacious of them!\nOh!\nCould that mean...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Could it be that CIPHER stole all the missing\nBATTLE CDs?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you found any BATTLE CDs?\nI hope you work hard to find many different\nones.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello!\nWelcome to REALGAM TOWER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Unfortunately, I must inform you that the\nCOLOSSEUM is undergoing maintenance.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please do come back and make a challenge\nwhen we reopen.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're not running off with \nthem?\nYou've got guts, but...\nHuh?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait a second!\nYou're that brat who was at GATEON PORT!\nWhat are you doing here?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're nothing but bad news!\nEver since I saw you, I've had nothing but the\nworst luck!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: First, at GATEON PORT, some\nguy challenged me to a battle out of the blue \nand promptly stomped me flat.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Then GORIGAN gave me one \nmajor dressing-down for showing off SHADOW \nPOKéMON without permission.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Because of that, he made me \nstand guard here as punishment.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's one thing I can't \nfigure out, though.\nHow'd GORIGAN ever find out about me anyway?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gaaah!\nRemembering that is getting me riled!\nThis time, I'll flatten you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tenacious little punk.\nYou're not getting past here, though![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, hey, hey!\nThis is no place for a kid like you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No, no.\nCan't let you in, nope!\nYou run along now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is no place for a kid like you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? Wait a minute.\nThat weird machine on your left arm...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You look sort of like that kid I saw on TV,\nbut maybe not.\nHey, kid, were you ever on TV?
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what?\nThe kid taking the fight to CIPHER is you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, what an opportunity!\nI'll knock you out and earn myself a promotion \nto ADMIN![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, you're right.\nA little kid like you couldn't possibly be taking \nthe fight to CIPHER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hold it, there![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: That kid's special.\nHe's not anyone you lot can beat.\nIf you know what's best, let him through without \na fuss.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nDon't make me laugh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, kid.\nYou let us handle things here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It wouldn't pay to make \na racket.\nAll it'd do is alert the guys inside the building.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, WAKIN![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey!\nYou guys are from TEAM SNAGEM!\nWhat do you think you're doing here?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GLOOM!\nHit them with SLEEP POWDER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waah! What is this?!\nWhat do you think...\nThis isn't fair...\nZzz...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good going, WAKIN![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh!\nGlad to be of service![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now's our chance!\nHurry!\nWe can wreck CIPHER right now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh!\nGLOOM's some kind of useful, hey?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come on, move it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Zzz...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Snork...\nMutter...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gloo, gloo.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou don't know what this place is?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This, my friend, is a factory that outputs\nSHADOW POKéMON.\nQuite impressive, wouldn't you agree?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew...\nWe'll be soon done with this SHADOW POKéMON \nproduction run.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's the last of the POKéMON we received\nfrom the S.S. LIBRA.\nBoy, I'm plain worn-down tired![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Intruder detected!\n...But it's just some kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, now?\nWasn't anybody keeping watch at the entrance?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What a nasty boy!\nIt's so rude to come in uninvited!\nI will punish you in place of your mother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, aren't you a cutie!\nHave you gotten lost all alone?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who gave you permission \nto enter?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That ruckus upstairs...\nYou're the cause?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, whew...\nI am downright bone-weary.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're under orders to take a full shipload\nof POKéMON and turn them into SHADOW\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But we'll be done with this job soon.\nThen, I'm going to take a good long bath to \nunwind![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've got to be good to \nget this far![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You get on my nerves, the \nway you scurry around![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The man in charge,\nMR. GORIGAN, is on the top floor of this \nfactory.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you an acquaintance of MR. GORIGAN?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, busy, busy, busy!\nI have to put in overtime every day!\nUnbelievable!\nIt's terrible for my complexion![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Nobody called for me, but \nhere I am!\nTadaaaaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No, no!\nYou're not allowed to go any farther![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We achieved a technological \nbreakthrough for transforming many \nPOKéMON into SHADOW POKéMON \nat the same time, unlike the old, slow way.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's how we managed to \ndeal with all the POKéMON from the S.S.\nLIBRA in this short time.\nWe can keep doing it, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If anyone tries to meddle \nwith our fantastic plan, this is what happens![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The majority of the SHADOW \nPOKéMON we made here have already been \ntransported out.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've also heard that the \nCIPHER HQ has completed final tuning of XD001,\nthe ultimate SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Looks like you got here just \na little bit late.\nAhaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So, it's you, is it?\nThe one who's been causing a 14% loss in \nmanufacturing productivity?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah!\nYou're the kid that dropped in on us at\nthe S.S. LIBRA?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I see now.\nYou know far too much more about CIPHER than \nyou need to know.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If nothing's done about you, \nthere's a 98% likelihood that this factory and \nthe SHADOW POKéMON plan will be endangered.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In that event, the danger to \nCIPHER goes up a whopping 54%.\nThat's critically bad news.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I suppose we'll have to coax \nyou into giving up the chase right here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I had a hunch that you had \na 28% chance of coming back.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm!\nI'm impressed that you got here!\nI'll have to make you feel welcome![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Above here is the factory's \nall-important CONTROL MACHINE!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I can't let you pass, even if \nit takes inches off my chest![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay...\nNow, all there's to do is adjust the voltage...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me see...\nWhere's the SYSTEM LEVER?\nHuh?\n...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nI left it on my desk!\nThat's not smart...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi!\nYou've come along at just the right time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're not busy, can you run a little errand\nfor me?\nGo downstairs and grab the SYSTEM LEVER \nthat is sitting on my desk.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey!\nThat's my SYSTEM LEVER!\nYou went and got it for me!\nThank you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Wait!\nWho are you anyway?!\nYou don't belong here!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn!\nIf the voltage goes up even a little, \nthe computer controlling this whole facility will \nshut down!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And, oh my gosh!\nIf that were to happen, the SHADOW POKéMON \nproduction software could be destroyed!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I can't let you lay one finger on this\nCONTROL MACHINE![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you don't want to be \npunished again, hand over my SYSTEM LEVER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you don't want to be punished again,\nhand over my SYSTEM LEVER![dialogue_end]
It says, "To adjust voltage, use the SYSTEM \nLEVER.\nWARNING: Do not raise voltage too high."\cRaise the voltage?\nOr do you want to lower it?
[Player] used the SYSTEM LEVER to lower \nthe CONTROL MACHINE's voltage.\c...But nothing happened![dialogue_end]
[Player] used the SYSTEM LEVER to raise \nthe CONTROL MACHINE's voltage.[dialogue_end]
The CONTROL MACHINE has gone wild![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: What's going on?!\nThe production line's stopped!\nThe control computer's not responding!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! You're that punk from\nthe S.S. LIBRA!\nYou're behind this, aren't you?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no! What the blazes?!\nThe SHADOW POKéMON production software's \nbeen deleted!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: GORIGAN gets furious if \nthings don't go his way!\nHe's going to chew me out again![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You shouldn't have wrecked \nour manufacturing system.\nYou're going to pay for it now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Where are all my crew?\n...You wiped them out?\nEvery last one?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Impossible!\nOne kid took down all those SHADOW POKéMON \nwe made?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Urrrgggh!\nIn wrecking my factory, you smeared dirt all \nover my good name and standing!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?! Back again?!\nI'll stomp you, whale on you, pulverize you,\nand devastate you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ugwaaah!\nThat's it!\nYou're not getting away with this!\nNo way, no how, no ifs or buts!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm not taking this!\nI'll blow up the factory with you in it!\nGwaaooooh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GORIGAN.\nThat is quite enough.\nAccept that you have lost.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: M-MASTER GREEVIL![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hohoho.\nWe meet again.\nYou do remember me, don't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, indeed!\nI am MR. VERICH.\nOr perhaps I should say GREEVIL, the GRAND \nMASTER of CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I must say I am taken aback.\nI never once imagined that you would destroy \nour factory.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that's not important.\nEven though the mass output of SHADOW \nPOKéMON has ended, our plan itself is\nunharmed.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We have already completed \nXD001's final tuning.\nIt now rests with me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: XD001?!\nThe ultimate SHADOW POKéMON that's resistant \nto purification?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, I shall prepare our final \nplan to activate XD001.\nDo you honestly think you can stop me?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I shall be at CIPHER's HQ.\nIt is on CITADARK ISLE off the coast of \nGATEON PORT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It is an impregnable fortress \nthat repels all with cruel waves and thick clouds.\nNo one can reach it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come if you dare.\nI'll enjoy waiting for you.\nHohohoho![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hyahyahya!\nMASTER GREEVIL has such a wicked sense of \nhumor!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: No ordinary ship can get \nclose because of the rough seas.\nAnd even if you do manage to get on the \nisland...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The place will be swarming \nwith TRAINERS carrying the SHADOW POKéMON \nI made!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Even though there should \nbe a lot more SHADOW POKéMON...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If XD001 didn't drop that ship \nin the desert, we wouldn't have taken so long\ntuning the SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hyahyahya!\nBut it doesn't matter.\nThere're plenty of SHADOW POKéMON to\nwelcome you in style!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: How many are there?\nHeheh, I can't tell you that.\nIf I did, it'd floor you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's just a matter of time \nbefore the world belongs to us.\nYou'd better be ready for it![dialogue_end]
It's a list of manufactured SHADOW POKéMON!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: We've been robbed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nGive it back!\nBring it back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: These two weird guys took off with a SHADOW\nPOKéMON!\nOne had like, a mohawk, and the other had hair \nlike, a ball!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nThey made off with the last SHADOW POKéMON \nthat came off the production line before it shut\ndown![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The abducted SHADOW POKéMON was a\nDRAGONITE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That ended up being the last SHADOW\nPOKéMON to be made at this factory.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That means...\nThat DRAGONITE is the last authentic SHADOW \nPOKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?\nYou shut the factory down?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: MASTER GREEVIL is going to be furious when\nhe hears that!\nI don't want to be around to see that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We've been spotted, so there's no point in\nhiding anymore.\nWho are we?\nWe're TEAM SNAGEM![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM?\nCan't rightly say I know them.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: See?\nHe doesn't know either!\nIt's bringing tears to my eyes!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, we should go.\nWe should leave this up to GONZAP.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Be quiet!\nWe've finally managed to track down CIPHER, \nhaven't we?\nWe're not just leaving now!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you, you big lunk!\nWe have business in that building!\nStand aside if you don't want to get hurt![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Lunk?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're calling the dashing \nand terrific MR. [bubble_or_speaker] a lunk?\nHow dare you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Grrrrr!\nYou're not getting away with this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gwaaah!\nDarn it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: See, what'd I say?\nIf we would've just waited for GONZAP, this \nwouldn't have happened.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: WAKIN must have reached the hideout by\nnow and given that SNAG MACHINE to GONZAP.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you want more of where \nthat came from?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urgh...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll pull back and regroup!\nLet's get back to the hideout![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nThat's what you get for acting tough![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There, see?\nThat's the mighty ZOOK's real power!\nI can take anyone if no one's bothering me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Get lost, punk!\nOr are you angling for another thrashing at the\nhands of the mighty ZOOK?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're just some kid!\nHow could I, the mighty ZOOK, get beat by just \nsome kid?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Because you fluked out!\nYou only won because you got lucky!\nThat's got to be the answer!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I won't battle you again.\nIf you win by a fluke again, my reputation will\ntake a beating![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Get lost, punk!\nIf I, the mighty ZOOK, get serious, you'll be \ncrushed in no time![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're getting on my nerves \nthe way you keep poking around where you're \nnot welcome!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And what's with that weird \nmachine on your arm?\nYou wanting me to thump you again or what?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that's what you want, I'll \nbash, thrash, and crash you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Quit scurrying around!\nYou're getting on my nerves!\nDon't think you're hot stuff just because you \nbeat me once by a fluke!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And what's with showing off \nthat weird machine on your arm?\nYou're begging for a thumping, and I'll deliver it \nthis time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll bash, thrash, and crash \nyou, just like you want![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've done it now!\nI'm steaming mad, and there's no forgiving that. \nEver!\nBe prepared to drop![dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]RAISE
[unknown2_07_1]LOWER
[Player] downloaded the list onto the P★DA.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi, [Player]!\nImagine meeting up with you here!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm covering the police \nauthorities and their raid on CIPHER's secret \nfactory.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Aren't they awful people?\nHow could they do such terrible things to \nPOKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boy, when we're lucky, we \nget on a roll.\nI didn't think we'd get to capture scenes of \nactual arrests.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nI'd better get my camera set up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, it's you.\nApparently, there are still perpetrators here that \nare involved in the production of SHADOW \nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We've arrived with backup \nunits to make mass arrests of those \nperpetrators.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, this isn't good.\nThe machines stopped working.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urrrrgh...\nThe punk thumped me...\nAnd GORIGAN will be furious with me again...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...I should go away.\nSomewhere far away where CIPHER won't have \nany influence.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So long, punk.\nI've had enough of battling you to last a lifetime.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you!\nThat thing you're riding on--it's kind of cool!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I have this feeling I met you in a port\nsomewhere, but I don't give a hoot about that.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I do have a problem when someone shows up\nhere without passage on our boat![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you!\nYou came back again?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I told you--we have a big \nproblem with strangers showing up uninvited![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nI've got to report this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You look suspicious.\nI won't let you go on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: He usually never leaves the\nLUXO CRUISER...\nWhere's he off to in such a hurry?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I know!\nYou chased him off!\nHahaha, just joking!\nWant to race me?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're pretty decent!\nSo, who are you? Huh?\nI guess it doesn't matter![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I should be swabbing down \nMASTER GREEVIL's LUXO CRUISER, but I'm \ncompletely lost.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What is wrong with me?\nI've got to buck up and focus.\nHey, kid, what say we battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're a bighearted kid!\nI'll show my respect and go all out![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nThat's mighty cold and cheap of you!\nI'll straighten you up with a battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't back-talk to any tough\nbattler.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nMaybe...\nAre you someone suspicious?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You really were someone\nsuspicious![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, oh!\nYou are so that little boy who ran off with \nPROF. KRANE!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you came again?\nDid you want to see me that much?\nOh, I am such a heartbreaker...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you're terrible!\nI mean really!\nMASTER GREEVIL will be oh so cross with me\nagain!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ooh, how I so dislike you!\nI'll be glad, little boy, when MASTER GREEVIL \nand XD001 make you pay![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a proper research \nfacility, sweetie.\nA little guy like you shouldn't be in here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DOCTOR, we can generate even bigger waves\nthis way...\nIsn't it great...\nZzz...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We've got good waves going again today.\nFrom the island it keeps others away.\nIsolated is how we want to stay![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A whirlpool is created when water currents\ncollide.\nTry it when you're taking a bath.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We don't get to see too many kids here.\nAre you a child of one of our research people?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're responsible for keeping CITADARK ISLE\nringed with vicious waves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to this place, it's not easy for ships\nto approach CITADARK ISLE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We researchers are honored and happy to\nserve MASTER GREEVIL.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our research funding is more than generous.\nAnd it's incredibly fun to create giant waves![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to change into my white lab outfit,\nso don't come in!\nPromise me, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The job of the research \npeople is to conduct research.\nBut that's not our job!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To terrify people into the pits\nof despair through battling...\nThat is our purpose!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: With that clear vision, we are\nnot about to lose![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're right in the middle of \nputting the finishing touches on our SHADOW\nPOKéMON plan.\nWe don't need your meddling![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're hanging tough in this\nmagma-hot heat!\nI thought I was going to melt waiting![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You look cute, but you're \nalso brave and bold to come to a place like this.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It would be a shame to beat\nsomeone like you, but this is a good chance to\nscore some points with MASTER GREEVIL![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, sorry.\nThis is a dead end.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sorry, I can't tell you what \nI'm doing at this dead end.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're going this way?\nI don't think that's a wise decision.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Because you have to beat me\nto go this way![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please!\nGo right through![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa!\nYou're making a huge mistake if you think you\ncan get past me without an incident![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I was the one who made \na huge mistake![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I know what you're after!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, I'm not going to let you\npass![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wahahaha!\nYou thought there was no one this way, \ndidn't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're not getting off the\nhook that easily![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm throwing everything at \nyou with no restraint!\nI can't take this brutal heat anymore![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My name is KARBON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My name is PETRO![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Together, we bring...\nThe power-double explosion attack![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Get this!\nYou'll learn that I have incredible power even \nby myself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gorgeously I make my \nentrance!\nWith flowing elegance I battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did I startle you?\nI did spook you, didn't I?\nI should do that to you in battle, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wroooaar!\nWatch your head!\nKeep an eye on the ground, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kiyeeeh!\nYou're never getting by me!\nI'll be yelled at if I don't stop you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mufwofwo!\nSo, we meet again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My plan was perfect.\nThe only problems were the utterly useless\nLOVRINA and GORIGAN, and...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You.\nYou spoiled the brilliant plan I had devised for\nPHENAC CITY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And thanks to that terrible, \nhard-nosed woman, I suffered the humiliation of \nhaving my worst moment broadcast all over \nORRE...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mufwofwo!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My planning is perfection.\nI shall be happy to battle with you as often as\nyou wish.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urggggh!\nMy plan!\nMy perfect plan!\nMASTER GREEVIL, forgive me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're leaving already?\nBut not before I show you my brand of \nhospitality![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Going upstairs?\nWhile we're waiting for the elevator, let's battle,\nyou and I![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's been a while, boy.\nDo you remember me?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you recall this?\nI helped you in GATEON PORT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...There's no need for thanks.\nI was merely punishing a fool that used \na SHADOW POKéMON in public.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: At that time, we didn't want \nthe world to know what we, CIPHER, were\nplanning.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Back then, I thought you \nwere just an ordinary child...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I had expected you to do \nbetter, but you disappoint me.\nYour abilities are strictly limited.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You are but a puny presence\nnot worthy of battling.\nBe gone![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I realize now that I should \nhave crushed you much earlier.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hohoho!\nNow this is quite a surprise.\nYou managed to defeat ARDOS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, you have also \nbeaten so many of my followers.\nPerhaps it's no surprise that you won.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hohoho.\nI imagine you won't be able to get in, even\nsomeone so clever as you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh!\nIt's me again, kid!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You know, it makes me kind \nof happy to see you since I've seen you so\noften!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But the way you keep beating\nme, my cred's taking a beating!\nAiyeeeh!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Feh!\nBack again?!\nCome back all you want, but nothing's going to\nchange![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bleah!\nThat was the very last chance MASTER GREEVIL\ngave me!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You won't quit being a pest,\nwill you?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ELDES![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Sir![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who allowed this child to \npenetrate our defenses so deeply?!\nWhat is the meaning of this?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The others can't be counted\non at all.\nI am giving you the responsibility of dealing with\nthis child.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've finally managed to\nanger MASTER GREEVIL.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought I would end up \nbattling you one day...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But this isn't how I had hoped\nto face you.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine. I understand.\nBut once we begin, expect no mercy.\nThat is my philosophy.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sorry...\nThe GRAND MASTER's orders are absolute.\nI can't refute them.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If that's what you want, I will\naccept your challenge.\nExpect no mercy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You are powerful.\nMuch more than I had imagined.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you aim to stop our plan,\nthen you should keep going.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, the GRAND \nMASTER's power is probably far greater than \nyou can imagine.\nI doubt you will beat the man...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thunderstorms above, and\nwhirlpools below.\nWhat could it be?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You have to be kidding,\nthough.\nI don't stand a chance against a guy who\nthumped ELDES![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Working at the HQ makes me \nan elite!\nWhat more proof do you need?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However bleak the situation,\nI never give up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hohoho.\nSo, you have even come this far.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I had no idea that a mere\nchild like you would pursue me this long.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The creation of SHADOW \nPOKéMON that permanently resist purification.\nThat was the first step.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Next, I plan to create an army\nof SHADOW POKéMON that work independently\non my orders alone.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When this second step is\ndone, I will take over the world without having to\nrely on bothersome people.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And now...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me introduce you to my\nfaithful servant.\nThe one that shall become the central figure in\nmy SHADOW POKéMON army.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come forth, XD001![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Code name XD001...\nNow freed of all adjustments, I present to you\nSHADOW LUGIA!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This LUGIA is the first of the\nSHADOW POKéMON that cannot be purified.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, let us celebrate the\ncompletion of my SHADOW POKéMON plan \nin advance!\nFall prey to SHADOW LUGIA![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hohoho!\nMy LUGIA is delighted to see new prey arrive![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: How dare you, child!\nHow dare you snag my SHADOW LUGIA!\nMy one loyal subject!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's nothing left!\nBut I will personally see to the total destruction\nof your POKéMON!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hohoho!\nReturn as often as you wish!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The more you rebel, the\nhappier my POKéMON become![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How...\nA mere child...\nA mere child crushed my cherished plan?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what?\nThis can't be!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Grrr...\nIt's your fault!\nI won't forgive...\nThere is no forgiving you!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: GRAND MASTER!\nWe're done here!\nWe should blow up CITADARK ISLE with the\nchild still on it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But...\nIf I did that, our SHADOW POKéMON data and\nour subordinates would be lost as well...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GRAND MASTER, such things\ncan be replaced!\nWe must ensure our own survival!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've readied a helicopter for\nour escape.\nWe've got to leave now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Y-you're right...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Please wait.\nYou're willing to sacrifice everyone so you can\nescape?\nYou should be ashamed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ashamed?\nClinging to foolish pride will guarantee CIPHER's\ndemise!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER must survive.\nThat is our first duty.\nThe GRAND MASTER feels the same way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Y-yes...\nFor CIPHER's sake, sacrifices must be endured...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What are you saying?\nThe SHADOW POKéMON factory has been \ndestroyed!\nXD001 was defeated!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Nothing remains of CIPHER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Silence!\nCIPHER will live forever!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: If only this child hadn't...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: GRAND MASTER!\nPlease give the order to blow up CITADARK\nISLE![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Yes. It can't be helped.\nDon't begrudge us, child.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Stop!\nLet's put a stop to this.\n...Father![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't call him Father!\nCall him the GRAND MASTER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Father, you've lost sight of\nwhat is important.\nYou got carried away by this whole GRAND\nMASTER nonsense.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It isn't possible to take over\nthe world by producing powerful POKéMON.\nJust think of this child...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: This child's pure heart won\nout over XD001.\nWe were in the wrong.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Silence, silence, silence!\nWhy aren't you showing some spine!\nWe've come so far![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER is finished.\nFather, you yourself should know that more than\nanyone.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, please.\nStand up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This is how it should be.\nThe laws of the land will render judgment on\nwhat we have done.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh...\nEverything I did...\nAll of it was a mistake...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to your courage, we\nwere finally able to wake from our nightmare.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\nYou'll have nothing to fear from us ever.\nYou should return home to your family.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let us meet again, too.\nThe next time we battle, it won't be as mortal\nenemies.\nI will look forward to it.[dialogue_end]
It's too hot to approach![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I must say that I haven't been\nthis excited in a long time.\nI do have an appreciation for the strong, \nyou see.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, I also cannot allow\nyour interference.\nMy SHADOW POKéMON plan is nearing \ncompletion.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: So, for the time being, I think\nI will have you securely out of the way right\nwhere you are now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Because of what you did, \nMASTER GREEVIL was oh so angry!\nIt made everyone miserable, and it's so all your\nfault!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But it's okay now.\nWe didn't need PROF. KRANE anyway!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I just so needed to be serious\njust a little tiny bit to get XD001's final \nadjustments just right!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It is so perfect now!\nPurification will so not work on it ever!\nI'm so amazed because I am so a genius!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh? You want to see my \nXD001?\nOh, so sorry, that is so not possible!\nWhy? Because...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I am so going to defeat you, \nlittle boy!\nHere I come![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So, MASTER GREEVIL gave \nme this one last chance to redeem myself.\nBut this is it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I lose this one, there's no \ntomorrow!\nHere goes![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How could I keep losing to \nsome kid over and over?\nIf there were a tree, I'd climb it to get away\nfrom all this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: To gain MASTER GREEVIL's \nforgiveness, and for me to assume my rightful\nposition as the GOVERNOR of ORRE, I must \ndefeat you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This time, I won't be shy \nabout revealing to you the full extent\nof my power.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Little did I suspect that you \nwould become CIPHER's biggest and most\ndamaging threat.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's enough talk.\nYou have the skills and wherewithal to reach\nCITADARK ISLE.\nLet me see your abilities in full glory![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is out of my hands now.\nI must defer you to MASTER GREEVIL himself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, boy, don't think\nthat this is over.\nI won't abandon my dreams![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If we battle, it will only be\nunfulfilling and without meaning.\nWill you challenge me knowing that?
[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE, DATA ROMs,\nand the LAIR...\nYou alone derailed every one of our well-laid\nplans.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, perhaps not just you.\nThe news broadcast by ONBS did not help\nCIPHER's cause at all.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, my SHADOW \nPOKéMON plan isn't finished yet.\nThe final act is about to unfold.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Having come this far, I think\nyou've earned the right to know what I have\nplanned.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fall![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ohhh...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nHow'd you manage to get to this island?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You rode that here?!\nThat's awesome!\nEven MR. VERICH, the world's richest man, \ndoesn't have one of those!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, aye!\nIt excites the sailing man's heart in me!\nListen, how about letting me take a ride \nsometime, huh?
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's right!\nThat's the spirit of the man of the sea!\nI don't know if this is much of a thanks, but \nI found this in the ship.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, now, come on!\nA luxury cruiser's fine and dandy, but for a real\nsailing man, a tough and wild boat's the ultimate,\nam I right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, come on, fellow!\nThink it over just one more time!
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way, what brings you here?\nGet your errand finished quick so I can go sail\nwith you![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh!\nI can move freely again!\nNow I can battle without feeling squashed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heh, you've figured out who we are now,\nright?\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh!\nI can move freely again!\nNow I can battle without feeling squashed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh...\nWhat's your hurry?\nWhy so rushed?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nYou're asking me if I'm a fake?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: How rude of you!\nHow could there be any fake as handsome as\nme, I ask you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Help me!\nPOKéMON are chasing after me!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou'll help me?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why, thanks!\nBut you should be worried about yourself first![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Warrrrgh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?\nYou want to help me again?\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Why, thanks!\nBut you should be worried about yourself first![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sorry, lad.\nThe shop's closed today.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nYou're taking on CIPHER in town?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I bet you could use an item for healing your\nPOKéMON.\nI'll tell you what!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure you'll get something if you can\nbeat me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, okay.\nYou really want that useful item, don't you?\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure you'll get something if\nyou can beat me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, now look here!\nThat look you're giving me says it all!\nIt says you know my real identity!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Guess what?\nYou're right!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: There are many things that you'll be better off\nnot knowing, little boy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll admit you do have guts to come back after\nlearning my identity.\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: You'll see that you were better\noff not knowing, little boy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, whoa, whoa...\nA whole bunch of JUSTYS popped out!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It would take someone as good as JUSTY to\npull off a DOUBLE TEAM himself!\nHe's so awesome![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're kidding?!\nThere was an impostor pretending to be JUSTY?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So that weird guy that went running off toward\nthe STADIUM--he must have been the fake![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw a bunch of odd-looking people come\ntearing out of the MAYOR's place.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?! They were CIPHER?!\nYou must be joking...\nIs the MAYOR all right?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou're looking at me with suspicion, aren't you?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uhyahyahya!\nWell, aren't you the good judge of character![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nAre you still eyeing me with suspicion?\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Uhyahyahya!\nYou remain a good judge of character![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bah!\nLooks like our secret's out of the bag already!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We didn't want any attention until our recovery\noperation was done, but it's too late for that\nnow!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nDid I say recovery operation?\nDon't you worry about it!\nIt's got nothing to do with you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Looks like our secret's out of\nthe bag already!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We didn't want any attention until\nour recovery operation was done, but it's too\nlate for that now!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whaaaat?!\nA CIPHER soldier was blocking the entrance?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: No wonder we weren't getting any customers!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine and dandy!\nIn times like this, the things we sell truly come\nin handy!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ssssnore...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hunh?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I... I'm sorry!\nI must have nodded off!\nIt's so quiet here...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to the PRESTIGE PRECEPT\nCENTER, or as everyone says, the PRE GYM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou have a letter from the MAYOR for JUSTY?\nIs that right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nI hear a little voice whispering to me...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: And that voice tells me to take that letter\nfrom you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, good for you!\nSuch determination to deliver that letter![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what...\nWhat is happening?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You are good.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But the way you battle is different.\nPOKéMON are just tools for battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The way you battle...\nYou play things too safe with your POKéMON!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Since you don't seem to hear what I'm saying,\nI suppose I'd better just beat it into you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now do you get it?\nPOKéMON are just tools for battling.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're good.\nYou figured out that I'm the real JUSTY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou're wondering if I'm a fake, too?\nOkay, yes, if you want to be precise, I'm the real\nJUSTY impersonator![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Even JUSTY couldn't do a thing when we\nshowed him we had hostages galore.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He's being a model prisoner along with the\nMAYOR and the rest of them right here in PRE\nGYM's basement.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you want to play hero and rescue them...\nWell, you need to deal with me first![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You want to play hero that much and\nrescue that sorry bunch we have downstairs?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hate to break it to you, but\nyou're too weak for the job![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Snicker...\nSorry, pal, beating me won't set the bunch\ndownstairs free.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You need the ELEVATOR KEY\nto get into PRE GYM's basement.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sorry to say, nobody trusts me\nwith anything important like that.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I...\nI'm having a bad dream!\nThis is just a nightmare, isn't it?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi, little boy.\nDidn't anyone tell you to stay out?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Stay out of this, kid!\nIt's for your own good![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Forget it!\nYou can't have our videotapes!\nYou can't do this to the press![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For a prisoner, you're rather\nhard-nosed, I must say.\nBut it just wouldn't do to have those tapes\nbroadcast to the public.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I have been promised the position of\nORRE's GOVERNOR by none other than MASTER\nGREEVIL.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, you must understand, it wouldn't\ndo to have it be known that I have muzzled\nthe citizens of PHENAC.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that got out, imagine what harm it\nwould bring to my pristine political record.\nNow, hand over the videotapes, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't care about your sick aspirations!\nDon't you dare underestimate the power of the\nfree press!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ONBS stakes its very existence on delivering\nthe truth for justice!\nI will get this news out![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's so sad that you won't listen\nto reason.\nVery well, I suppose you leave me with no\noption...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! You!\nAre you the dastardly child who won't stop\nfooling in our affairs?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: EGROG!\nWhat were you doing?\nGet rid of this pest![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Sir, yes, sir!\nMR. SNATTLE, sir!\nAye, aye, sir!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, boy!\nPlaytime is over![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, kid!\nHaven't had enough yet?\nI told you, playtime is over![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That was stunning...\nThat footage should be electrifying.\nCAMERAN, did you get that on tape?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: S-sorry!\nBut you can't expect me to keep filming under\nthese conditions.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, for...\nThis is precisely the time your camera should be\nrolling!\nShow some journalistic guts![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Cut! Cut!\nIf MASTER GREEVIL were to see this, he would\nbe most displeased!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I have no mercy for anyone in\nmy way, even for a child like you!\nYou answer to me now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You are so tenacious!\nI told you not to disturb me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How is this possible?!\nI've never seen a child so strong!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, no matter!\nSurely I've bought GORIGAN enough time.\nHis precious recovery operation must be\nfinished by now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Today, we will leave quietly.\nBut don't you forget us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you!\nYou kept them from taking our videotapes.\nWe've got some explosive footage!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My name's MARCIA.\nWe were gathering news in PHENAC when\nCIPHER caught us and brought us here.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: But there's a silver lining in this--\nwe managed to capture your heroics on tape!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: We did, didn't we?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hehehe, yeah, you bet I did!\nI got everything on tape this time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, we need to rush back to\nPYRITE and get this news out on the air as soon\nas possible.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's meet again!\nThank you for everything![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi!\nHow was it?\nThe REALGAM TOWER, I mean.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou haven't gone yet?\nOh, you don't know what you're missing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not even out of your way or anything.\nGo enjoy yourself at the REALGAM TOWER. I'm\nsure you'll love it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Off you go for a good time![dialogue_end]
There is something on the floor.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The JUSTY who was at PRE GYM was a fake,\nwasn't he?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Where is the real JUSTY, then?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nIsn't that the ELEVATOR KEY you have there?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you use that on the control desk over there,\nthe elevator should operate.\nBut why would you have it?[dialogue_end]
[Player] inserted the ELEVATOR KEY\nand gave it a twist.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nIt was one strange thing after the other today.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't think anything will startle me after\ntoday.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm PHENAC MAYOR TREST.\nW-who are you?\nH-how did you get here?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had been happening to\nthe MAYOR.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my!\nSo, you, [Player], sent that scoundrel\nSNATTLE packing?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That is quite amazing!\nDoes that mean we can finally leave this\nmiserable place?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Everyone!\nI need your attention, please!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let us all thank [Player]\nheartily, then get out of here!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I thank you\nsincerely![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see...\nSo we were close to having CIPHER replace all\nour citizens with their members...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, what a heinous plot!\nBut it was stopped, and we owe it all to you,\n[Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: On behalf of the whole city,\nI sincerely thank you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In fact, I can't thank you enough\nright now.\nIf you could, please visit me at my home later.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], right?\nYour actions saved the city.\nWe all owe you a big thanks!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like to keep in touch.\nMay I get your P★DA number?\nI'll give you a call if anything comes up.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think PHENAC was targeted\nbecause CIPHER wanted to quash rumors that\nwere spreading in town.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They were seen moving things in\nthe desert.\nI guess they didn't want anyone to know about\nwhat they were doing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should ask around for\ndetails from the people in the city.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I came from AGATE to take my granddaughter\nhome.\nBut just as I got to PHENAC, I was caught up in\nthis whole affair!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you so much.\nWe can finally return to AGATE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I was going to visit AGATE with my grandma,\nbut then those people came and locked us up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to run a DAY CARE just like my\ngrandma when I grow up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you, [Player]!\nIf you visit AGATE, please come to\nthe DAY CARE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A fake that looked just like me was standing\nhere?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right.\nBut she wasn't as pretty as me, I bet.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're right.\nNo one can imitate my natural cuteness![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ooh, shudder...\nIt gives me the creeps just thinking about it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They were close to replacing me with an\nimpostor, weren't they?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I fell asleep during class.\nWhen I woke up, I was in PRE GYM's basement.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I better not fall asleep in class--that's the\nlesson![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how dare they!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My impostor gave lessons on how POKéMON\nare just tools for battle?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And she even wrote that on my whiteboard?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how dare she!\nWhat she did is simply unforgivable![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a training facility for POKéMON and\ntheir TRAINERS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They provide a good mix of environments so\nPOKéMON of any type can get worthwhile\ntraining.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I got separated from my POKéMON when they\nheld us prisoner.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey!\nWhere are you?!\nCome on, TRAPINCH, come back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We are all JUSTY!\nWe are! We are!\nPeople all look up to us!\nFor we are the JUSTY GANG![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Count off!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Six!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Five!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Four!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Three!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Two!
[bubble_or_speaker]: One!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...That's it!\nPerfect!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: When we all look this much alike, even I,\nyour own brother, can't tell any of us apart...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Everyone knows why we're here?\nOur job is to confound any enemies that stumble\nonto us here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll all scatter and deflect attention away\nfrom PRE GYM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If my plan works, we may be in line for an\nADMIN position!\n...Maybe.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Brothers!\nMay you undertake your orders with pride\nand diligence!\nTo your positions![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nI've seen that kid before...\nWasn't that at the desert LAB?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...No, my mistake!\nI'm JUSTY now, hahaha!\nI couldn't have seen him!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, there!\nI'm JUSTY and I brawl for justice!\nIf it's advice you need, I'm here for you,\nmy friend!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nA LAB? In the desert, you say?\nI don't have the faintest idea.\n...You don't believe me.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You little snoop!\nWhy can't you just let certain things slide by?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, I'm JUSTY!\nIf it's advice you need, I'm here for you,\nmy friend.\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: ...Right, okay.\nThat ruse doesn't work with you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bleah!\nDon't you forget this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, I'm JUSTY.\nI'm the toughest of the toughs, and the most\npopular guy in all PHENAC besides!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In other words, I look just like JUSTY even\nwithout putting on a disguise!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Look at me!\nI look cool like JUSTY, eh?\nCome on, I'll take you on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm tougher than JUSTY, who seems to be\nsome pop idol!\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: I'm saying this only because\nI really am cool![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I get serious, the\nconsequences could be really bad.\nThat's why I took it easy on you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, you nitwit.\nThere's no point having two JUSTYS hanging\naround here together.\nGo somewhere else.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, but...\nI found this place first!\nYou go find your own place.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Nonsense!\nFor someone as elegant and gorgeous as I, only\na setting this plush is worthy.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You...\nDon't use that condescending tone on me.\nI'm older than you!\nAnd besides, we're both JUSTY now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What the...\nWhat are you looking at?\nYou think we're putting on a show or something?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But, what's been seen can be used as\nwitness testimony.\nYou can curse your luck, but we can't let you\nwalk away![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, look!\nThat kid's come back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, sheesh!\nDidn't I tell you we're not some sideshow?\nOr...\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Can't you get over my gorgeous\nand elegant battle style?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're tough enough that I'm\nwilling to let you become my little brother.\nThink it over, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph.\nYou're just a kid, but you're good at battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hate battling.\nI wish you'd leave me alone.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Buzz off, already.\nI'm trying to project myself as a cool and\nintellectual JUSTY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A cool and smart guy doesn't waste his time\nbattling.\nHowever...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a different story when it comes\nto pests![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boy, you're persistent.\nWhy don't you go play somewhere else?\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, all right.\nI'll take you on just this once.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Haven't you had enough?\nGo somewhere and play.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're too young a kid to understand this,\nbut women, they like snooty kinds of cool guys.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So I figured by impersonating JUSTY, I'd be\na homing beacon to the ladies, but...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: All the women here are my comrades\nin arms!\nThey all know me!\nThere's no point in chatting them up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm tired of acting all snooty and cool when\nit's not helping me attract any ladies!\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: If I push you around,\nI think I'll feel a whole lot better.\nHere goes![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're just a kid!\nYou're too strong for one![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm JUSTY!\nMy fellowship is six!\nSo there are also six JUSTYS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There are six of us, so our sense of presence\nis sixfold!\nOur appeal is sixfold, too!\nWe're not just bit players!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come on, kid.\nI'll take you with my sixfold power![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu, kid.\nI'm not just some ordinary JUSTY no one\nnotices.\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Come on, kid!\nI'll take you on with presence and appeal\nboosted sixfold!\nOh, and power boosted six fold, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You haven't seen anything of\nour brotherly love yet![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA!\nWait for me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What did CIPHER want to keep secret so much\nthat they would imprison us all?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nCould it be...that they're building a new base in\nthe northern desert?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to you, we got out from that\ncooped-up place.\nMy AZUMARILL's delighted, too!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way, have you heard about the desert?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder what they were transporting out\nthere?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: People are saying that they've seen CIPHER\nmembers moving things in the desert north of\ntown.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rumors say that maybe it's SHADOW\nPOKéMON being moved.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But there's supposed to be nothing in the\ndesert out there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Rilu riluu![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, there!\nIt feels just super to be out running in the open\nlike this again!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm DASH!\nI'm an upstanding citizen who likes to jog around\nthe fountain.\nPleased to meet you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Casaaa![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: They say you saved the town in its darkest\nhour.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It would give me great pleasure to battle\nthe hero of our fair city.\n
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah!\nYou'll grant me my wish?\nThen, let us begin![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh.\nThat's too bad.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well, well!\nNow, that was fun![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, hello, hero!\nAre you up for a battle with me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our MAYOR's come back!\nHe seemed to have a happy bounce in his step.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess we owe that to you, too!\nThank you, dear![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Breathe in... Ahhhh...\nBreathe in... Ahhhh...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After being locked up underground with all\nthose people, the air outside is delicious![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you know about the REALGAM TOWER?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, have you already been there?\nI have trouble choosing the kind of battle\nI should try when I go.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The REALGAM TOWER is the pride of PHENAC\nCITY.\nIt's a facility dedicated to battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I go there occasionally.\nI enjoy battling, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: To TRAINERS, POKéMON are invaluable as if\nthey were friends.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But CIPHER is using POKéMON for their\ncriminal acts.\nThey can't be allowed to get away with that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Linooon![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It kind of burns me up!\nIt's not fair that JUSTY couldn't do a thing\nduring this incident.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JUSTY's really tough!\nIf CIPHER comes back again, he'll take care\nof things by himself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, youngster.\nThe STADIUM up ahead is no longer in use.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ever since the REALGAM TOWER started\nholding battles again, all the battles have been\nheld over there.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nMy impostor said the exact same thing?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Imagine the nerve of it!\nHow dare he impersonate me that much![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Siid! Siido![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Everyone came back all of a sudden.\nI was startled!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The lady here's really cute, though.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I should take a break from traveling and stay\nhere a while.\nEhehe.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't recall exactly when, but there was\na ground-shaking boom in the northern desert.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think it must have been a meteorite.\nThat's what it sounded like.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It wasn't long after that when those shady\ncharacters showed up, scurrying about in the\ndesert.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you for freeing us from that basement.\nWe can finally get back to work!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nThank you for saving us.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I'm sorry, too.\nWe're still setting things up here.\nPlease visit us again later.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, welcome!\nBut we're still setting things up.\nPlease come back later.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If CIPHER shows up here again, why, I'll go\naround impersonating them![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ohh...\nThe joy of shopping like this again.\nIt makes me glad to be alive![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm thinking of going to the REALGAM TOWER\nto get better at battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to get stronger so we'll never be\nbothered by the likes of CIPHER again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahh, whew!\nHome...\nIt's the best place to be.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nTrapped underground?\nWhat are you saying?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I just got back from a stay at MT. BATTLE.\nI haven't the faintest idea what you're trying\nto say.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, traveling kid!\nMy wife finally came back!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The poor thing!\nShe must have been held against her will with\neveryone in town.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For the next while, I'll do the chores around\nhere so she can recover.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm finally home where I belong, and it's all\nthanks to you.\nI'll be forever grateful, son.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I should tell you, CIPHER attacked PHENAC\nbecause they're doing a recovery operation in\nthe desert in the north.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm certainly old, but my hearing is quite fine,\nthank you!\nSo, I eavesdropped on their furtive little chats.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, listen!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It was really noisy!\nThere were so many of them roaring about in the\ndesert!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There were these big trucks running back\nand forth pulling big cargo.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The people in the trucks looked really shady,\ntoo.\nIt was just so weird, I just had to tell everyone!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Want to hear it again?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww!\nYou don't want to hear about the trucks again?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, hello, [Player]!\nSo good of you to come!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our city was saved by your\nselfless actions.\nI sincerely thank you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a mere token of our\nappreciation.\nPlease accept it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I must say, you saved us in our\ndarkest hour.\nJUSTY couldn't do a thing knowing that we were\nbeing held hostage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Honestly, if you hadn't arrived,\nI shudder to think what could have become\nof our city.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PRESTIGE PRECEPT CENTER,\naka PRE GYM, is getting ready to reopen!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When that happens, you can look forward\nto battling PRE GYM's outstanding TRAINERS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The time is now!\nI've got to hunker down and study the ins and\nouts of battling![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm not going to sneak any more naps in\nclass again![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll do the best I can to teach kids to be fine,\nupstanding, and respected TRAINERS like you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to say, [Player], you\nmust be highly skilled to rout CIPHER alone.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When PRE GYM's back in\noperation, I'd be honored to meet you\nin a battle.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou're here to battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: The STADIUM has been closed down.\nBut, would you like to battle with me?\nWe'll have the run of the place now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, you're right.\nAll battles are held at the REALGAM TOWER\nnow.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's no wonder, either.\nCOLOSSEUM BATTLES, BATTLE BINGO, and even\nBATTLE SIMs...\nThere's so much to enjoy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Doesn't it feel great to battle in\nthe wide open like this?[dialogue_end]
The sand is too deep for these tires.\nIt's impossible to keep going.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You tried going into the northern desert,\ndidn't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The northern desert's sand is very deep.\nAn ordinary scooter couldn't possibly make it\nthrough that sand.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw the news! On TV!\nYou're PHENAC's hero![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to you, we got out from that\ncooped-up place.\nMy AZUMARILL's delighted, too![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, there!\nIt feels just super to be out running in the open\nlike this again!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Being able to run around like\nthis...\nI owe you many a thanks![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, there!\nIt feels just super to be out running in the open\nlike this again!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Being able to run around like\nthis...\nI owe you many a thanks![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi!!\nDid you see? Did you see?!\nThe TV news!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You drove away CIPHER!\nWho took over our city!\nYou might be awesome![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw you on TV.\nI don't like saying this, but you were fantastic!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, you know what?\nNext time, JUSTY will be the one being the hero\non TV![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, youngster!\nI saw you on TV!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I would have liked to have seen my impostor\non TV, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw the news.\nIt looks like the townspeople had a rotten\ntime of it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, you know?\nBeing in a town this pretty and peaceful makes\nit tough for me to head back out on the road.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is weird...\nFood seems to spoil very quickly in my new\nrefrigerator.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I just got it new, too.\nIt seems to be working properly.\nI don't get it...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I was so surprised when I saw the news.\nI didn't know we had that kind of trouble while\nI was away.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw your heroic deed\non television!\nWe were so lucky to have you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I should tell you, CIPHER\nattacked PHENAC because they're doing\na recovery operation in the desert in the north.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm certainly old, but my hearing\nis quite fine, thank you!\nSo, I eavesdropped on their furtive little chats.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, hello, [Player]!\nI saw you on the news driving away that\nscoundrel SNATTLE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To prevail in battle over such\na daunting opponent...\nYou have my admiration![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nI saw you on TV.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing you send those criminals\nrunning made me realize again how strong\nyou are.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When this place reopens,\nI would be honored if you'd battle with me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right?!\nThe missing S.S. LIBRA was in the northern\ndesert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait, so that's why CIPHER was in the desert.\nThey must have been moving the POKéMON that\nwere on the ship.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nThe S.S. LIBRA was in the northern desert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So that object that fell from the sky in the\ndesert...\nIt was the S.S. LIBRA?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my!\nYou say the S.S. LIBRA was in the northern\ndesert!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That recovery operation CIPHER mentioned\nmust have been for the POKéMON on the\nS.S. LIBRA.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What? What?\nWhat was in the desert in the north?\nThe S.S. LIBRA?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Was the ship making all that noise carrying\nPOKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I beg your pardon?\nDid you say that the S.S. LIBRA was out in the\ndesert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That must be why CIPHER\nattacked our city.\nThey were seen transporting POKéMON from the\nmissing ship.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nThanks to you, PRE GYM will be set to reopen\nsoon.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou received my E-MAIL on the S.S. LIBRA?\nThe ship was out in the desert, then!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyway, like I wrote in my mail,\nwe finally managed to reopen the PRE GYM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I really would love\nto have a battle with you.\nWill you accept my challenge?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nYou remember my E-MAIL, right?\nPRE GYM is finally going to reopen.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I'd love to have\na battle with you.\nWill you accept my challenge?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to the PRESTIGE PRECEPT CENTER!\nOr, as everyone says, PRE GYM!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Everybody is welcome to participate.\nI hope you will test your skill against our stable\nof expert TRAINERS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's too bad how things turned out this time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But there's no need to be disappointed.\nYou may enter as often as you like, so make\nanother challenge![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Congratulations!\nIt's rare to see anyone win four straight\nmatches.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Next, you'll be going up against JUSTY.\nDo your best![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's too bad you lost.\nBut don't get down on yourself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's very rare for JUSTY to lose.\nThat's why you should make another challenge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to the PRESTIGE PRECEPT CENTER!\nOr, as everyone says, PRE GYM!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're finally up against JUSTY.\nDo your best![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Congratulations!\nIt's amazing!\nYou beat JUSTY!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's like a dream!\nI'm still finding it hard to believe![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to the PRESTIGE PRECEPT CENTER!\nOr, as everyone says, PRE GYM!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, [Player], our event champion!\nHow are you today?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello.\nHave you come to make a challenge at the PRE\nGYM today?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Or are you here for a lesson with me?\nYou're welcome anytime.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's too bad you lost.\nTo win battles, you really must consider how the\ntypes of POKéMON match up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If your party can't flexibly adapt to battling\ndifferent types of POKéMON, you shouldn't \nconsider yourself a good TRAINER.\nKeep that in mind.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Congratulations!\nYou're an expert TRAINER whose team can\nflexibly adapt to any type of opposing POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Your final battle will be against JUSTY.\nYour knowledge about POKéMON will be severely\ntested, so be prepared.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I knew that JUSTY wouldn't lose.\nBut your battle still had me on the edge\nof my seat.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The way you battle...\nThere's something different about it.\nIt has a spark that you don't find in the way\nordinary people battle.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see you're going to face JUSTY next.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JUSTY is strong, you know.\nEven if you focus and battle at your very best,\nyou may still be in for a rough time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bravo!\nThat was a fantastic battle!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To the best of my memory, the last time that\nJUSTY lost was five years ago.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...You know, maybe you're not meant to be\nonly the savior of PHENAC, but hero to all ORRE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, [Player].\nYou've visited at the perfect time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I was using your battles as examples in my\nlesson.\nYou're welcome to stay if you're curious.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you, uh, maybe...\nNo, I guess it's all right.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ever since that incident, I've grown suspicious\nof people.\nYou seem to be the real thing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow.\nI'm shocked that someone as skilled as you\nwould lose.\nThere's no telling how a battle will turn out![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing how you battle is very informative.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like for you to coach me sometime.\nI want to get tough.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Even you were no match for JUSTY...\nBut don't worry about it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: People say JUSTY hasn't lost once these\npast five years.\nIt's only natural that you couldn't beat him.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The next time you make a challenge,\nyou'll be taking on JUSTY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It thrills me to even think about the kind\nof battle you and JUSTY will wage.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm blown away!\nYour battle style is outstanding!\nHow could I get strong like you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess what compels you to excel is different\nfrom what compels me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm learning about your battles from our\nteacher.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Who taught you how to battle?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're self-taught?\nI bow to your greatness.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you come for a lesson, too?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Of course not.\nYou're here to take the PRE GYM challenge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you came so close.\nToo bad, huh?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you would've kept going, we wouldn't\nhave to study.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You pulled off the 4-win streak!\nThat's wicked!\nOkay, I admit it, I'm impressed.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: From now on, I'm cheering for you,\n[Player].\nGo for gold![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That was heartbreakingly close, [Player].\nI really thought that you could win.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to hand it to JUSTY.\nHe's not going to let anyone beat him easily.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player]!\nYou're going up against JUSTY next, huh?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm expecting big things from you!\nDon't let me down![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah! You did it, [Player]!\nI wasn't wrong when I sensed something\ndifferent about you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You, [Player]!\nFeeling great, are you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I mean, hey, you beat JUSTY.\nHow else are you supposed to feel but just\ngreat, thank you?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a training space for POKéMON and\nTRAINERS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Would you like to train with your POKéMON?\nYou may also want to try your hand at a\n4-win-streak challenge upstairs.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You took the knockout challenge upstairs?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you don't know about different POKéMON\ntypes, it must be tough beating four TRAINERS\nin a row.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, good for you!\nYou put together a 4-win streak.\nThat's a decent challenge right there.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JUSTY's next, though.\nI don't think JUSTY's going to lose to anyone.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, so you couldn't beat JUSTY.\nWell, try not to take it too hard.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're talking about JUSTY here.\nIt'd be impossible to beat him unless you have\nserious skills of your own.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nOff to challenge JUSTY, are you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou're not?\nOh, whoops, I got that wrong.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard!\nYou beat JUSTY, didn't you?\nThat is just wild![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a training space for POKéMON and\nTRAINERS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Would you like to train with your POKéMON?\nJUSTY trains here on an everyday basis.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you going for the 4-win-streak challenge?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're not, can you help me find my\nTRAPINCH?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You blew your 4-win-streak challenge?\nIs that a surprise or something?\nEven I haven't cleared it yet.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to take the challenge again just as\nsoon as I find my TRAPINCH.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou finished the 4-win-streak challenge?\nReally?!\nUnbelievable!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I don't know...\nI wonder if you can beat JUSTY.\nAfter all, he is the PRE GYM LEADER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That look on your face tells me you lost to\nJUSTY just as I predicted.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You shouldn't overreach.\nYou're more reckless than you look.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you thinking of battling JUSTY?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't think you should.\nJUSTY is incredibly tough.\nYou're being reckless.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You beat JUSTY?!\nOh, no, beaten to the punch!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, if only I could find my TRAPINCH!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I had it, I might have beaten JUSTY before\nyou![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've given up trying to find my lost TRAPINCH\nfor now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I might take the cue from you and try raising\na wild [var_2].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\n...Hm?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What happened to that machine\nyou had on your arm?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had happened\nto JUSTY.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see.\nThis is serious, though.\nLosing the SNAG MACHINE is bad news.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But I'm surprised that TEAM\nSNAGEM still existed.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What are they going to do with\nthat SNAG MACHINE, I wonder?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard!\nIt was the S.S. LIBRA out in the desert up\nnorth!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe they were going to turn the S.S. LIBRA\ninto their secret base?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, did you hear?\nThey found that S.S. LIBRA in the desert!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Lately, my husband's been doing all the\nchores, so I've got time on my hands.\nI wouldn't mind going to take a look for myself.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, [Player]!\nI saw the S.S. LIBRA on television!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It simply amazes me that a huge\nship would be beached out in the desert.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I understand that the\nPOKéMON on board were already gone when the\nship was found.\nThat is rather worrisome...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is PHENAC CITY.\nIt is a desert oasis where water is plentiful and\npure.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to you, PHENAC returned to normal.\nBut it worries me that CIPHER is still lurking in\nthe ORRE REGION.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi!\nYou must like PHENAC, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou want to know if I've been here the whole\ntime?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ehehehe, yeah, actually.\nI've decided to quit traveling and live here.\nWhy don't you consider it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's all because of you that we can spend time\nat home in peace and quiet.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now that it's become peaceful, I feel like I'm\nmissing something.\nI wonder if there's anything exciting going on?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I might go out to the REALGAM TOWER and\ntry my luck at BATTLE BINGO.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, [Player].\nPHENAC is at peace, and it's all because of\nyou, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you know, [Player],\nabout the "SHADOW incident" five years ago?\nThe mastermind behind that whole sordid\naffair was...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: None other than the mayor of\nthis city!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In public, he was a kindhearted mayor.\nBut his secret identity was CIPHER's boss with\nvisions of taking over the ORRE REGION!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's frightening even now!\nI beg your pardon?\nMe?\nI'm a purely authentic and civic-minded mayor![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nAnd on your arm I see the SNAG MACHINE!\nYou got it back!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's where it belongs, too.\nIt's like a bat to a baseball player.\nThe SNAG MACHINE is a part of you, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You should ask around for\ndetails from the people in the city.[dialogue_end]
There is something shiny between some books!\nBut it's wrong to take anything that belongs\nto someone else.[dialogue_end]
There is something shiny between some books!\nBut it's wrong to take anything that belongs\nto someone else.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's up?\nOh, just a BATTLE CD, huh?\nI thought maybe my POKéMON came back.[dialogue_end]
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nWhat is that?\nWhat's something like that doing in my place?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Is it maybe...?\nDid CIPHER leave it behind?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bah...\nIt makes me uncomfortable knowing those\nCIPHER crooks lived here even a short while.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: If that's useful to you, then you should take it.\nWe're all counting on you to defeat CIPHER for\ngood.[dialogue_end]
[Player] found\na BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you found another one\nof those things?\nCIPHER must have run off in an awful hurry.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They left behind all sorts of\nthings in their haste.\nPlease, if you find it useful, do take it with you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Casaah! Casawaah![dialogue_end]
[Player] obtained BATTLE CD 15\nfrom the CASTFORM.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, long time no see!\nYou think my running style's more refined?\nWell, naturally!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I train with my CASTFORM like\nthis every day.\nYou can have that BATTLE CD.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rather than BATTLE SIMs, I'm\nmuch happier running around in the sun.\nWell, I have to go![dialogue_end]
[Player] gave JUSTY the P★DA number.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\nI'll be in touch.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been thinking.\nI think PHENAC was targeted because CIPHER\nwanted to quash rumors that were spreading\nin town.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: People in the city have seen shady\ncharacters coming and going in the desert.\nPeople were talking about it.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey!\nWhere'd you go off to?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you visited the REALGAM\nTOWER already?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: One day, I would like to see you\nin a battle, [Player].[dialogue_end]

[Player] stealthily made the POKéMON listen\nto the VOICE CASE.[dialogue_end]
But nothing happened.\nThis VOICE CASE doesn't seem to contain this\nPOKéMON's cries.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: At PRE GYM, four TRAINERS and\nI await all challengers.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: First, you're required to take on\nthe four TRAINERS in knockout matches.\nYou have to beat all four of them in a row.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nWant to challenge our TRAINERS?\nAre you feeling up to it?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Great, let's do it!\nLet's get you up on the stage![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, okay...\nThat's too bad.\nI hope you'll definitely join us next time.\nWe'll be waiting.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Looks like you're all set.\nLet's get started.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nLet's bring out our first TRAINER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Close, but you came up short.\nI thought you'd clear the challenge, too.\nIt's disappointing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope this doesn't discourage you.\nCome back for another challenge when\nyou're ready![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Great job!\nThe hero of PHENAC gets it done!\nI don't see any blind spots in your battle style.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I finally get the chance to\nface you.\nShall we have our battle right away?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Great, let's do it!\nLet's get up on the stage![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you ready?\nHere we come![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I knew it!\nYou are tough.\nI'm not happy about losing, but I'm delighted\nabout battling you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hahaha.\nIt's been five years since I lost like this.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like you to have these as\nsomething to remember our battle by.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you use them.\nI'm sure they will help you.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Battling you was a very meaningful\nexperience for me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure I'll be looking back on our\nbattle and relishing its memory for some time.\nThank you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Even though you couldn't beat me,\nI sense something in you that other people\nsimply lack.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe it's that power you hide\nwithin that enabled you to free PHENAC.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When you gain a little more\npower, I hope you will come see me again.\nI will be honored to face you in battle anytime![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nI've been looking forward to a battle with you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Want to have a battle with me?\nAre you feeling up to it?

[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm your next opponent.\nLet's just see how good you are.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't measure up at all.\nI've got to train a lot more...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: With my furtive, ever-shifting\nattacks, I shall claim victory![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've brought shame upon me...\nI want to run and hide...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Watch closely!\nI'll treat you to elegant attacks that blend the\npower of POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hahaha.\nJUSTY is next.\nAnd he's very, very strong.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA!\nWait!\nWait for me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gasp, gasp...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There goes MARCIA tearing off like a tornado,\nas usual.\nThere goes one busy girl.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nWhat's up with you, kid?\nWhy are you giving me the eye like that?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you know who I am?\nI'm CAIL.\nThey call me the gatekeeper of PYRITE!\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hehe!\nThat smoldering look says you're raring to\nchallenge me.\nIf it's a battle you want, I'm here!
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, then!\nI'll show you what being CAIL, the\ngatekeeper of PYRITE, is all about![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Then what is that smoldering\nlook you're throwing my way?\nYou're sending me mixed signals here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, kid!\nI have to hand it to you.\nYou have to be good to beat CAIL,\nPYRITE's gatekeeper.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You leave the PYRITE\ngatekeeper job to me!\nYeah, I know I lost to you, but...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw MARCIA running off.\nShe's always bursting with energy, that one.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: That impatient energy of MARCIA's... She gets\nthat from her father, DUKING.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is PYRITE TOWN, famous as the home\nto ONBS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You came to take a tour of ONBS, too,\ndidn't you?\nI can tell!\nWe get visitors from all over!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The ONBS BUILDING stands next to the big\nwindmill.\nYou really can't miss it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, then!\nWhat have we here?\nWell, if it isn't TRUDLY and FOLLY!\nWhat do you think you're up to?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: What are we up to?\nYou've got it all wrong.\nWe're here to do some shopping, that's all.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now don't you lie to me!\nI know about the likes of you.\nYou're up to no good, aren't you?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Cut us some slack, OFFICER\nJOHNSON, sir.\nWe've had a change of heart.\nWe've sworn off our criminal ways, yes, sir![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: No, no, no!\nThat doesn't wash with me, no sir, it doesn't!\nI won't have you lot walking around the streets\nas if you owned the place![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tch! Pompous oaf!\nFOLLY, the man won't listen to reason.\nLet's get out of here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Those two that just ran off--\nthey're named FOLLY and TRUDLY.\nThey once belonged to CIPHER, but just as mere\ngrunts.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Back in those days, they\nwreaked havoc as if they owned the place.\nBut I caught up with them and put them straight!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I cut quite the dashing figure,\ndon't I?\nIt's my job to uphold the peace in PYRITE!\nPow![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, wait! Wait!\nYou came from another town, didn't you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: On the way here, did you happen to spot any\nwild POKéMON?\nI've never seen any in the wild.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You know how the environment around these\nparts was too caustic for POKéMON to survive?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But recently, people have been saying there\nare wild POKéMON out and about.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that so?\nThen, there's no point in asking.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'd better return to the\ninn again today and get rested up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But before I do that, a little\nspot of exercise would be the thing.\nIt'll let me sleep better.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, sonny, how about we have\na quick battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good, good!\nWe'll work up a good sweat together![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, that's too bad.\nWe could've built up a good sweat![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're quite a toughie.\nI'm sure surprised.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should check the DUEL\nSQUARE up ahead here.\nYou'll be sweating up a storm.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is the DUEL SQUARE,\nwhere the weak fail and the strong prevail.\nDon't be rattled if someone suddenly challenges\nyou to a battle.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you get the urge to battle,\ncome for a visit.\nWe're always waiting![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't matter to me who\nmy opponents are, even little kids!\nI battle with all my might![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You...\nWho do you think you are?\nI'm not losing next time, you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is the DUEL SQUARE!\nWe live by tradition here.\nThere's no need for greetings, just battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If anyone demands a battle here\nin DUEL SQUARE, you shouldn't complain.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's the rule around here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You want a battle with me,\ndon't you?\nI can tell.\nI was seized by the urge, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Not bad!\nIt's not going to be this way next time![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bonjour!\nDid you know?\nMy POKéMON and I match trés bien!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't think I can ever\nlose now!\nI'll show you my aggressive style![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This can't be right.\nFATEEN's fortune-telling has a reputation of\nnever being wrong.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is the ONBS BUILDING.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There've been too many shady people hanging\naround lately.\nI'm keeping an eye on things to keep out those\nsorts of bad elements.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There once was a town ruled by CIPHER\nbeneath the cliff here.\nThe town was just called THE UNDER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When CIPHER's hold over the town was\nbroken, the UNDER citizens moved out into the\nsunlight.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm one of them.\nONBS's NETT is another former resident of\nTHE UNDER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They went and buried THE UNDER to prevent\npeople from getting to the abandoned town site.\nIt's sad to see my hometown go like that.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My name's ROKIT!\nI'm warming up right now.\nCould I get you to clear the way?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish you wouldn't bug me!\nI'm getting warmed up for COLOSSEUM BATTLES![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, don't you think it's too\ntough for us to pull anything in this town?\nOur faces are too well known.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, I hear you.\nIf we don't hurry, the boss will get impatient\nand come looking for us himself.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hehehe, we're okay on that\nscore.\nI went and snuck a transmitter on the boss.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You can tell where he is by\nchecking this RADAR.\nSo, we can always be ready for him when he\nblows his top.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I have to hand it to you,\nFOLLY. Way to go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nTRUDLY, looks like we've got E-MAIL.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gaah! Is it the boss?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm... Let's see...\n"You two come back right now!" it says.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww, gosh darn it all!\nHe sounds like he's fuming!\nHe might dock us dinner again.\nWe'd better scoot back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tch!\nWell, so much for this RADAR!\nIt's not much use if the boss is going to page us\nby E-MAIL!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, man, why do our lives have\nto be this tragic?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you heard?\nWild POKéMON have appeared!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: FATEEN, who's considered PYRITE's mother,\nforetold the appearance of POKéMON in the wild!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, it came true!\nIt's incredible.\nWe'll now be able to catch wild POKéMON right\nhere in the ORRE REGION.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Find what you seek, be it an\nobject, person, or luck.\nWelcome to FATEEN's FORTUNE-TELLING\nCHAMBER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I am FATEEN.\nIf ever a problem clouds your brow, you shall\ncome to me.\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: MR. DUKING, this town's\nleader, took my fortune-telling to heart.\nHe searched high and low for the wild POKéMON\nI had foretold.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: His search has been rewarded.\nHe appears to have found several locations\nwhere wild POKéMON appear.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm SHERLES, the CHIEF of\nPYRITE POLICE.\nAre you a traveling TRAINER?\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: The town has become\npeaceful, but there are still plenty of\nroughnecks around.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They know how to keep us\nbusy, what with their brawling and so on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Lots of them will go out of\ntheir way to pick a fight with you.\nBe careful when you're out on the streets.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Owowow...\nI got lumps on my head from some shiny-headed\nguy thumping me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't deny I lipped off at him first, but he\ntook a swing at me first!\nYou've got to let me out of here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nI got locked up over a dumb street fight.\nIf I don't get out of here soon...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nKid, are you...\nThat thing on your arm...\nIt can't be!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nOh, nah, it's nothing.\nGet lost already.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've never seen a wild\nPOKéMON before.\nI can't wait to get my eyes on one![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DUKING's the leader\nof PYRITE.\nHe also operates the COLOSSEUM here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But lately, I hear he's letting\nhis right-hand man SILVA run things.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, DUKING's committed\nto his quest to find wild POKéMON.\nWe're expecting big things from him, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm SILVA.\nI'm the OPERATING MANAGER of PYRITE\nCOLOSSEUM.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'm MANAGER in title\nonly. I'm just filling in.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: DUKING, the town's leader,\ndiscovered a place where wild POKéMON gather.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ever since then, he's been\nengrossed in searching for wild POKéMON.\nIn the meantime, he left me in charge of the\nCOLOSSEUM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you want to battle, you\nshould go straight to the COLOSSEUM\nregistration desk and apply.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I make POKé SNACKS that wild POKéMON\ncan't resist.\nDUKING asked me to make them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I never imagined I would be getting a part-time\njob at this age.\nHohoho.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But it's a bit too dark and chilly for my old\nbones to take.\nAchoo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What should I buy today?\nI'd like to buy some X ACCURACY, but I don't\nhave enough money.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, if someone were to say, "I'll give you\nten POKé POLES for free," would you take them?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, of course you would.\nAnyone would make that mistake and accept.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see...\nYou seem to be able to make decisions coolly.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I must be a total nincompoop for accepting\nthese useless red and white sticks![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you going to the\nPOKé SPOT?\nI envy you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I want to catch some POKéMON\nof my own and become a great TRAINER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you use different items for treating your\nPOKéMON when they're hurt in some way?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I get lazy, so I use FULL HEAL for clearing up\nany kind of trouble.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to the PYRITE SUPER GRAND\nHOTEL!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: One stay at our sumptuously appointed and\nmost gorgeously decorated hotel in the very lap\nof luxury will leave not only you, but your\nPOKéMON, feeling fully restored!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We don't offer a children's rate, but I'm sure\nyou'll find our charge of $[unknown_4B] to be a mere\npittance.\nWill you stay with us tonight?
[bubble_or_speaker]: A boy your age traveling all alone...\nIt's quite inspiring.\nYou've earned this rest.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nHow disappointing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you'll stay at the PYRITE SUPER\nGRAND HOTEL next time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you've had a good rest.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you'll stay at the PYRITE SUPER\nGRAND HOTEL again the next time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh, it seems you don't have\nenough money.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As kindhearted as I am, there isn't much that\nI can do in this case.\nI'm sorry, but you'll have to find lodging\nelsewhere.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I was at the COLOSSEUM where I managed\nto beat my first three opponents, but couldn't\npull off the last win.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You don't win the prize if you can't put\ntogether a 4-win streak.\nI'm going to get some hard-earned rest and\nmake another challenge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been traveling through the ORRE REGION.\nI think the ravaged land is getting better little by\nlittle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't think it will be all that far off before\nwild POKéMON can survive out here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh!\nIt's a wild ZIGZAGOON!\nIt's cute!\n...Sssssnore...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, for thirty-five years, I have spun these\ngears ～♪\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, what's with you, youngster?\nDo you want to spin gears, too?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wahaha!\nNot to disappoint you, but this isn't a job that\nanyone can just pick up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Give it another twenty-five years, then come\nback.\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wahaha!\nNo doubt, no doubt!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been doing this for thirty-five years!\nOnly I can do this!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The electricity generated by this windmill\npowers the COLOSSEUM and ONBS, among other\nplaces.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If the gears don't break or get stolen, the\nwindmill is an infinite source of energy.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When CIPHER ruled PYRITE, the ADMIN in\ncharge was a man named MIROR B., I think the\nname was.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That name is laughably silly, but he was\nsupposed to be a tough battler.\nI would've liked to take him on.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to ONBS!\nAll visitors are free to wander the ONBS\nBUILDING and see our network in operation.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My name is MEGG, and I'm the official guide.\nGlad to meet you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Shroo.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: This SHROOMISH is my friend.\nIsn't it cute?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh? You're looking for my big\nbrother, NETT?\nHe's on the top floor of this building.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you come to take a tour of ONBS, too?\nI've been here lots of times!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ONBS used to be called the KIDS' GRID HQ\nbefore.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard it was started by a bunch of kids.\nIsn't that cool?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ONBS was founded by SECC and NETT.\nIt's now the biggest information network in the\nORRE REGION.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Nowadays, SECC handles the business side\nof things, and NETT acts as the chief of\nengineering and technology.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, sorry.\nMaybe that was a little complicated.\nFeel free to wander and look around.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're getting news reports from all over like\nwe always do.\nOur reporters are keeping busy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The hottest news story going right now is the\nwild POKéMON story.\nIt's become the latest craze![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: RAZELL and DAZELL are a hot new idol duo\nfrom GATEON PORT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They can sing, dance, and even perform\nmagic stunts.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, my name is RAZELL.\nI've been chosen to dance during the opening of\na new program!\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: I'm ecstatic, but I'm really\nnervous, too.\nWhat should I do?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, I'm DAZELL!\nAren't I just the cutest?\nThis is how I always am!\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: After all, we're going to be\ndancing in front of the show's title logo!\nWe have to show us at our very best![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ORRE, ORRE, ORRE~♪\nNETWORK ~♪\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aack!\nDid you hear me?\nOh, no!\nIt's so embarrassing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That was the ONBS song that I composed.\nIt's catchy and memorable, don't you think?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, welcome to ONBS.\nThe name's SECC.\nI'm supposed to be in charge here.\nI'm glad to meet you.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Started by kids five years\nago during the "SHADOW incident," a tiny\nnetwork has grown into this today.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I operate this place with my\npartner, NETT.\nWe're convinced that reporting the unvarnished\ntruth will be for the good of peace and justice.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyways, did you want\nsomething from me?[dialogue_end]
[Player] passed on PROF. KRANE's message\nto SECC.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're kidding!\nCIPHER was using its desert lab again?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, understood.\nYou should take that DATA ROM and show it to\nNETT right away.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure he can decipher\nwhatever information is stored on that\nDATA ROM.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: After fighting against CIPHER\nfive years ago, we decided a free press that\nreports the truth was necessary to protect the\npeace and justice of people.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why NETT and I\nfounded the ONBS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not an easy job to report\nthe unvarnished truth in a fair manner.\nIn a way, this is a battle, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: NETT's a guy you can count on.\nYou won't have a thing to worry about where\nhe's concerned.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm hoping to put together a new POKéMON\nbattle program.\nI'm gathering information for it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm trying to decide on the star.\nHmm...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Since it is a program about battling, I suppose\nthe legendary TRAINER EAGUN would be the\nlogical choice.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, we're going live!\nCue![dialogue_end]
We bring you a special news bulletin!\cPROF. KRANE, the abducted head of the\nPOKéMON HQ LAB, has been safely rescued!\cPROF. KRANE had been held captive in CIPHER's\ndesert research facility, which was widely\nbelieved to have been abandoned.\cReports say that PROF. KRANE was rescued by\na lone teen.\cThis incident is evidence that CIPHER has\nreturned after apparently being crushed five\nyears ago.\cThe authorities fear that CIPHER's return could\nresult in more serious incidents.\nCitizens are urged to be vigilant and cautious.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's a wrap!\nGood job, ANCHA.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It might be hard to imagine, but when ANCHA\nwas starting out, she was prone to on-air\ndisasters.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now look at her.\nShe's become ONBS's top newscaster.\nThere's absolutely no question about that\nthese days.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ANCHA's looking great like she always does.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm ANCHA.\nI'm a newscaster here at ONBS.\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: My job is to deliver the news\nto as many people as possible.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I was starting out, I did\nexperience some close calls.\nBut still, I find this job to be fulfilling.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaaah!\nI don't know where my mommy is!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please!\nCan you help me find my mommy?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yay, thank you!\nI wonder where my mommy went?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My mommy isn't over there!\nShe's in this building![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Man, is she slow...\nHow long is she going to keep me waiting?\nGrrr...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm supposed to be out covering a story with\nour oldest veteran reporter, but she takes\nforever getting ready every time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The day will be done at this rate![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I know that I still have my looks, but when I'm\ngoing before the TV camera, I have to be extra\ncareful with my makeup.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh... This isn't going well.\nI have to go on the air soon, but my KANDEE\nhasn't come back...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nMommy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: KANDEE, sweetheart![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mommy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, am I glad to see you!\nI was worried about you!\nYou seemed to just disappear![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sorry, Mommy!\nI went out of your room for just a minute, but\nthen I couldn't find it again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That guy there brought me here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my!\nHow very kind of you!\nThank you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I was lost, I felt really\nlonesome, Mommy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm so glad we found you,\nMommy!\nThank you, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sincerely, thank you.\nThis is just a small token of my appreciation.[dialogue_end]
[Player] received a SOOTHE BELL as thanks.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: KANDEE has to go into the studio to tape\na music program.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure it will be aired soon.\nWhen it is, I hope you'll tune in and see her sing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is where we keep sets and props.\nWe can't have you getting hurt here, so out you\ngo, all right?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Keeping information as data is fine, but I also\nlike seeing it kept in printed form on paper.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, I enjoy the feel of paper as I flip\nthe pages.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been told by NETT to not allow anyone\nthrough.\nHe's working right now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been told by NETT to not allow anyone\nthrough.\nHe's working right now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou came from the POKéMON HQ LAB?\nBut I still can't let you through.\nI'll get in trouble if I do.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DETRO, do we have a visitor?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, NETT!\nThis person here says he's come calling from the\nPOKéMON HQ LAB.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes, I was expecting him.\nPlease show him through.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, sure thing!\nI'll let him through![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, please!\nNETT's waiting for you inside.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh, I'm called BITT.\nGlad to meet you.\nNETT's over there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, I've been expecting you.\nYou're [Player], right?\nI'm NETT.\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: And this is BITT.\nHe's my friend and an invaluable partner.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Pleased to meet you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nI heard that you were alone.\nDid you bring your little sister with you?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: We heard from PROF. KRANE.\nSounds like you pulled off a daring rescue.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, BITT, but now's not the\ntime to waste chatting.\nLet's see the data PROF. KRANE called about.[dialogue_end]
[Player] handed the DATA ROM to NETT.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've deciphered something\nsimilar to this before.\nIt brings back memories.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay...\nI think it's going to take some time for me to\ncheck the contents of this DATA ROM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Can you wait while I do that?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, NETT!\nHow's this for an idea?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, that's good.\nGood suggestion, BITT.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you interested in wild\nPOKéMON?\nIt wouldn't hurt to go look, you know.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nMay I have your P★DA number?\nI'll contact you as soon as I find anything out.[dialogue_end]
[Player] gave the P★DA number to NETT.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\nI'll try to decipher this as quickly as possible.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heh, it's your fault for being\nin my way.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I've got what I came for.\nI don't need to stick around when I've got this\nDATA ROM.\nAdios![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, [Player].\nGo out to the POKé SPOT and wait for me\nto call.\nWho knows, you may see some wild POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The POKé SPOT that DUKING\ndiscovered is outside of town and to the east.\nThat's where wild POKéMON have appeared.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player].\nMy brother, NETT, called me about you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The POKé SPOT is in the east\noutside of town.\nI really hope you'll go see it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our news team should be out\nvisiting DUKING at one of his POKé SPOTS to file\na story about wild POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Since he's got free time, why\nnot have him go visit DUKING as well?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way, BITT.\nWhere is our news team?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That DUKING guy's supposed\nto have discovered some POKé SPOTS, huh?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I should go search for a new\npartner or two.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So, I am cooler than the\nCHIEF, wouldn't you say?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: One of these days, I'll be\nsitting in the CHIEF's chair.\nIt's as sure as a done deal!\nPow![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Sheesh.\nI'm a prisoner here!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That shouldn't have to include being this\njoker's captive audience![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Groan...\nThere's bad trouble...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A bunch of shady characters snuck in and\ntook MEGG, the receptionist, hostage.\nGroan... Cough! Cough![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Shrooshrooshrooo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nYou're not going this way![dialogue_end]
It's locked from this side.\cUnlock it?
Unlocked the door.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MEGG!\nThey came and took MEGG![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MEGG is NETT's younger sister.\nYou know, she's the receptionist.\nYou've seen her, right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The intruders grabbed her and hustled her\nupstairs with them in the elevator![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, all of you listen up!\nEverybody has to remain calm and quiet here.\nNo funny stuff!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If anyone tries to get out,\nthere will be serious consequences!\nGet it?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hunh?!\nYou're acting mighty suspicious![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaah!\nI was scared![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You saved us!\nThank you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You'd better be careful, though.\nThere are still many more of those\ncretins around![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaah!\nWe're saved! Yaaaaay!\nI thought we were doomed.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought they might keep us\nlocked up as hostages forever!\nThanks for rescuing us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, sweetie, I was waiting\nfor you.\nYou can bring it on.\nI don't go easy on little kids.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nAll you need to do is answer our questions.\nIf you comply, you won't get hurt.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hold it, punk.\nYou shouldn't be snooping around![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ouch...\nI didn't expect CIPHER to pull a stunt this bold or\nreckless...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: They came looking for NETT.\nI'm guessing that your DATA ROM contains\nsensitive information that they want to keep\nsecret at all costs.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll be fine.\nI'm worried about NETT, though.\nPlease go to him.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It was terrible!\nThey suddenly barged in here and started\nbeating SECC up.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We drove those freaky thugs out with some\nunfriendly persuasion.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Can you imagine the nerve of them?\nComing after defenseless women like me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheheh!\nANCHA, you're a doll!\nI see your pretty face on TV all the time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, you know?\nYou're a lot prettier in person than on TV.\nHeheheh.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what?\nWho are you?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm getting ANCHA's\nautograph!\nYou stay out of this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nThey slashed all the power cables!\nWe could've broadcast everything that\nhappened here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're our savior!\nI was terrified by the thought that they might\nhurt ANCHA.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks for your help!\nI don't think anyone expected the ONBS to be\nmade the target.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But you watch.\nWe'll get this story out on the news in a big way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hahaha!\nYou look mystified!\nYou don't know how I managed to be on the\nelevator with you, do you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll tell you what I did...[unknown2_09_78]\nI braced myself flat up against the ceiling!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It takes a lot of strength!\nNot bad, huh?\nI demand your respect!\nAnd now, we battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You lot!\nOne peep out of you, and you'll be sorry!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Awaaaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We were alone, my daughter and I.\nWe had no idea what would become of us.\nThank you very, very much![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yay!\nThank you for saving us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm pretty darn tough, I tell you!\nBe ready to be creamed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, now!\nThis is where we keep our props.\nWe can't have you getting hurt here, so beat it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-huh.\nI wonder who's going to be the one hurting?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nWhat do you want, kid?!\nStay out of the way if you don't want to get hurt![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What was that all about?\nI thought they were filming some special effects\nscenes![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My goodness, what a racket.\nI wish they'd keep things a little quieter.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hold it!\nI can't let you get past here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks for helping me!\nThose creeps suddenly showed up and drove me\naway from my lookout spot.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nWho cares about that?!\nThe creeps took MEGG hostage, and they took\nher into this room.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're really strong,\naren't you?\nPlease, help MEGG![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The creeps that took MEGG\nhostage are in this room!\nPlease, you've got to help her![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, hand over our DATA ROM!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of all the people it could've ended up with,\nit had to be with you, NETT, the wiz of data\nanalysis.\nIt wouldn't do to let you keep it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...All right.\nKeep your hands off my sister.\nThe DATA ROM is right here...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good boy!\nYou catch on real quick.\nToss me that DATA ROM nice and easy now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heh...\nOkay, I'll thank you for returning the DATA ROM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way...\nLet me guess.\nAre you maybe thinking it doesn't matter because\nyou've already copied the data on this?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CAPTAIN!\nWe've finished completely scrubbing data from\nONBS's servers.\nIt's all gone, sir.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waahahaha!\nThat's why I'm not worried!\nIt's heartbreaking, isn't it?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, thanks for being such a great host,\nbut we've got to go.\nHere's your sister back.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: NETT![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MEGG, are you all right?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hunh?\nWhat are you doing there, punk?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hate to be rude, but I've got no time to lose.\nGet out of my way![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Drat!\nI didn't see this coming.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I've got what I came for.\nI don't need to stick around when I've got this\nDATA ROM.\nAdios![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You sent those horrible\npeople running!\nSincerely, thank you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Those horrible people left.\nIt's because of your determination.\nThank you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the sound of it, they must\nthink that we haven't managed to check out the\ncontents of that DATA ROM yet.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Faulty assumption.\nThey shouldn't underestimate NETT here!\nHeheh.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nAre you okay?!\nYou got us out of that jam![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But not all the data analysis\nwas finished...\nTch!\nThose CIPHER creeps![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Still, from what we did manage\nto decrypt, a part of CIPHER's criminal plans\nbecame clear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For instance, CIPHER was\nbehind the disappearance of that cargo ship,\nthe S.S. LIBRA.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's more.\nCIPHER is planning a major attack on\nPHENAC CITY.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no, NETT!\nIs that true?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA's gone off to\nPHENAC CITY!\nShe said she was going to investigate why the\ntown's communication systems are down.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nCIPHER could attack there at any time![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], we need your help.\nPlease, could you inform the MAYOR of PHENAC\nCITY about CIPHER's coming attack?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, whoa!\nDon't you want to know what was on that\nDATA ROM?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll do my best to recover the\nprecious data that they deleted.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: In PHENAC CITY, there's a guy\nnamed JUSTY who's the LEADER of the\nPRESTIGE PRECEPT CENTER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Try to hook up with him.\nI'm sure he'll be eager to help you stop CIPHER\nfrom attacking his town.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA...\nI hope she's okay...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow! That was wow!\nYou took care of all those scary people!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm planning to get tough\nwhen I get older, but I'm not quite ready...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I keep telling him not to move, but he just\nwon't listen.\nHe is so obstinate![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nCIPHER is going to attack PHENAC?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Not good!\nWe've got to get MARCIA to come back!\nOwowowow!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nI'd go myself, but they worked me over pretty\ndarn thoroughly.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], please.\nCan you go help MARCIA?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a complete wipeout.\nThe ONBS servers have been scrubbed clean of\nevery bit of data.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Those CIPHER creeps...\nHow could they do something so heinous?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, MEGG was released unharmed?\nAm I happy to hear that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Those thugs appear to have left.\nThanks for driving them off![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I know there were a lot of them, but we\nshouldn't have been that unprepared.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I was giving CHIEF SHERLES here a rundown\nof events.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's amazing.\nThey pulled a caper of this scale so brazenly in\nbroad daylight...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If this incident is any\nindication, it appears certain that CIPHER will\nbecome even more active in the days to come.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did something go down?!\nI saw some shady types running off in\na big hurry.\nThey looked like CIPHER's foot soldiers.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA's been gone a long time.\nIs she on a tough assignment?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you visited ONBS?\nWasn't it impressive?\nI wish I could be on TV one day.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I can't get in touch with\na friend in PHENAC CITY.\nIt's weird that I can't.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He's always in the same place.\nAll he does is run around the fountain.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm SILVA.\nI'm the OPERATING MANAGER of PYRITE\nCOLOSSEUM.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'm MANAGER in title\nonly. I'm just filling in for DUKING, the official\nMANAGER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you want to battle, you\nshould go straight to the COLOSSEUM\nregistration desk and apply.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: DUKING finally returned, but now\nhe's closeted himself in the back room, where\nhe's busy at work preparing POKé SNACKS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He's apparently working with a secret\ntraditional recipe for making POKé SNACKS.\nHe wants to make POKé SNACKS available in\nshops so anyone can buy them.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeahah!\nOh, what have we here?\nAren't you the lad I met at the POKé SPOT?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, tell me!\nHave you been keeping busy catching yourself\nsome wild POKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you manage to catch any rare\nPOKéMON, bring them to me, DUKING, all right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nDo you maybe have a TRAPINCH, SURSKIT, or\na WOOPER with you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, that's too bad, then.\nIf you catch any rare POKéMON at a POKé SPOT,\nbe sure to come show me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeahah, lad!\nHave you perhaps caught a TRAPINCH, SURSKIT,\nor a WOOPER?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I make POKé SNACKS that wild POKéMON\ncan't resist.\nDUKING asked me to make them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I just made some especially tasty ones.\nI'm going to have DUKING sell my POKé SNACKS\nthrough shops from now on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After this, you'll be able to buy my POKé\nSNACKS whenever you need.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: FATEEN is considered the mother of PYRITE.\nHer fortune-telling ability is spookily accurate.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Just the other day, she warned that I would\nbe hit on the head with a ball.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She was right.\nI got beaned right on my head.\nFATEEN's warning was as accurate as that ball...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Find what you seek, be it an\nobject, person, or luck.\nWelcome to FATEEN's FORTUNE-TELLING\nCHAMBER.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, dear me.\nA problem vexes you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you so wish, I shall solve it\nfor you with my fortune-telling.\nFwofwofwo.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Very well.\nYour trust will not be betrayed.\nLet me begin.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kwaaaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Oh!\nWhat is the meaning of this?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fwofwofwo.\nCome back if you have a change of heart.\nNo harm will come of what I do.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The guy in the other cell made a clean\ngetaway, it seems.\nLucky him.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He's with TEAM SNAGEM.\nYou know, the gang that got involved in all sorts\nof shenanigans with CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Back in the day, they used to steal POKéMON\nfrom TRAINERS using some gizmo they called the\nSNAG MACHINE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hyuk-hyuk-hyuk!\nI thought TEAM SNAGEM went kaput years ago,\nbut I guess they're still around.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ohh...\nAm I in trouble...\nI was distracted for just a minute, and a prisoner\ngave me the slip and escaped.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The CHIEF will be furious with\nme, yet again...\nPow.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uraaah!\nTowaaah!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: From now on, no shady character will ever\nget by me!\nUrararaaaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER seems to be getting\ninto stride with their schemes.\nWatch yourself.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHIEF, I'm sorry, sir!\nI won't dawdle and chitchat anymore!\nPlease let me out, sir![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hyuk-hyuk-hyuk.\nThat pompous nitwit JOHNSON.\nHe had that coming.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's his punishment for letting a prisoner\nescape from under his nose.\nHyuk-hyuk-hyuk.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nI hope MARCIA is safe...\nI'm so worried...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Shrooshroo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Even though I had that horribly scary time\nhere, I still love visiting ONBS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Looks like it'll take more time before we can\nget our database back together.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Those rotten CIPHER cretins...\nThey sure made a huge mess of things.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm worried about MARCIA...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, and CAMERAN, the cameraman, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, RAZELL and DAZELL were good,\nbut KANDEE here has a spark of her own, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We need to begin filming her as soon as our\nsystem is back up.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please listen!\nIt's my daughter singing now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When it's sunny, SOLARBEAM~♪\nWhen it's rainy, HYDRO PUMP~♪\nPOKé POKé POKéMON are so cute~♪\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In case of paralysis,\nPARLYZ HEAL~♪\nFor sleepyheads there's AWAKENING~♪\nPOKé POKé POKéMON are so fun~♪\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're feeling hungry,\nthere are LEFTOVERS~♪\nAnd quench your thirst with MOOMOO MILK~♪\nPOKé POKé POKéMON bring so much joy~♪\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you'll learn the song\nand sing along with me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nCIPHER is already in PHENAC?[dialogue_end]
[Player] showed SECC the MAYOR'S NOTE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This isn't good...\nThe situation is far more serious than\nwe had imagined.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA is really determined.\nOnce she sets off to do something, she won't\ngive up easily.\nIt's an admirable trait, but...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Against CIPHER, her\ndedication could endanger her.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], please!\nWe need you to help MARCIA.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope MARCIA will be okay...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Those CIPHER creeps...\nThey even cut our power cables.\nThe rotten swine![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If they hadn't cut power to our cameras, we\ncould've gotten an incredible scoop.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll start running the news\nagain when ONBS's systems are \nrestored.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We finished covering the POKé SPOTS, and we\nneed to move on to our next assignment, but...\nPOFTY's acting up, like usual...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When one gets to be as\npopular as I am, things become different.\nI may still be a newscaster, but I feel like a star\nactress.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope our dance routine will\nbecome popular on TV![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ouch...\nI think I overdid it dancing.\nMy feet hurt now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, youngster!\nWould you care to hear some amazing news?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hold on to your hat!\nThe ONBS was attacked by CIPHER!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nYou don't seem to be very surprised...\nHow dull.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, don't be that way!\nHumor me and hear me out![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nCIPHER's already infiltrated PHENAC?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's terrible news.\nWe've got to do something...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see...\nI'm worried about the MAYOR, the people of\nPHENAC, and of course MARCIA...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please go back to PHENAC\nand keep an eye on what's happening there.\nWe really need your help on this.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How was PHENAC?\nHuh?\nThe MAYOR went missing?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I were a little stronger,\nI'd go help.\nBut I'm not ready yet...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA's come back!\nShe looked her usual perky self, too!\nI'm glad for her.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA's energy...\nShe gets that from her father, DUKING.\nHohoho![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I finally managed to get\nahold of my buddy in PHENAC.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Apparently, there was some\nserious incident going on in PHENAC.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Five years ago, we arrested\na man named EVICE who we thought to be the\nboss of CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But recently, it came to light\nthat EVICE was only the boss of the ORRE\nREGION, and nothing more.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In other words, CIPHER's real\nboss exists elsewhere, and he or she is directing\nthe syndicate.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER didn't collapse when\nEVICE was caught.\nIt was active all this time without anyone taking\nany notice.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nThanks to you, MARCIA returned safe\nand sound!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She's right back into her\nhigh-energy work mode and high-spirited ways.\nI admire her.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: With NETT providing sure tech advice, it looks\ngood that we'll recover the data CIPHER deleted\non us.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've been busy, haven't you?\nYou saved MEGG, MARCIA, and everyone in\nPHENAC CITY, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I should develop a new program series\nmodeled after you.\nDon't you think that's a terrific concept?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, RAZELL and DAZELL were good,\nbut KANDEE here has a spark of her own, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard all about you from MARCIA!\nYou were truly heroic, it sounds like![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks for saving MARCIA!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If it hadn't been for you,\nboth ONBS and PHENAC would have fallen under\nCIPHER's control.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I intend to see CIPHER off\nproperly in due time.\nThey have to be made to pay for their crimes.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But we're journalists.\nWe'll chase and corner CIPHER in our own way--\na way that's different from yours.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you'll watch how ONBS\ndoes things.\nThe truth can change the world.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I intend to see CIPHER off\nproperly in due time.\nThey have to be made to pay for their crimes.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you'll watch how ONBS\ndoes things.\nThe truth can change the world.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA's next door.\nI think she's editing the footage they shot and\nwriting her story.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She's doing that even after getting caught up\nin a serious incident.\nShe's one dedicated journalist![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello!\nThank you for rescuing me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm editing footage of what\nhappened in PHENAC for the news.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As soon as the story's ready,\nwe'll be broadcasting it on TV.\nLook for it, okay?\nBecause you're the hero![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello!\nThanks for everything in PHENAC!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I feared the worst when\nCIPHER caught us, but it turned out great.\nWe're stoked about the awesome footage\nwe shot![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We've completely repaired all the cables that\nCIPHER cut on us.\nWe're ready to go back on the air anytime![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Be sure to tune in.\nWe'll be running a huge news story soon.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: On our latest news story,\nSECC himself is directing the production crew.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It must be one huge story.\nThe atmosphere in the news studio is electric\nwith tension.\nIt's almost scary, even.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome back!\nI heard about your adventure!\nIt made me all excited![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard!\nEven PRE GYM's JUSTY was caught and held\nhostage, wasn't he?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Then you rode in and solved\nthings just like that.\nYou're even more awesome than I imagined![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nThank you so much for helping MARCIA.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We've been making good\nprogress at recovering the deleted data.\nWe're almost there, so we'll keep plugging away.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, we've got precious\ndata going back to our KIDS' GRID HQ days.\nWe can't lose that.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're not about to give up\nthe fight just because CIPHER managed to\nsneak in.\nWe'll keep slugging away, all of us together![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nWe've been expecting you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The person who needs your\nhelp finding the lost POKéMON is in my brother\nNETT's room on the roof.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nI got word from NETT about you.\nGo on, scoot up to the roof.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, by the way, we're almost\nfinished preparing the news story using the\nreport and footage filed by MARCIA's team.\nIt's shaping up to be a great story.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our PHENAC news story is\nshaping up beautifully.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, you're a huge part\nof our story.\nLook forward to the broadcast, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player]!\nWe've been expecting you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That old gent there needs\nhelp finding a missing POKéMON.\nIt'd be great if you could hear him out.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo!\nI heard what happened in PHENAC from MARCIA.\nI'm amazed that they even managed to hold\nJUSTY hostage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way, that old gent came\nhere with his granddaughter.\nHe's looking for help finding a missing POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], if you don't\nmind, please hear him out.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: These people here arrived\na while ago.\nThey came looking for ONBS's help.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: They wanted our help finding\na POKéMON that went missing with the\nS.S. LIBRA.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This is where it gets exciting.\nThey say it's a POKéMON that's never been\ndiscovered before.\nYow![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nThank you so much for helping MARCIA.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Speaking of help, these\npeople here came to us for some.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That old gent waiting there is\nhoping someone will help him locate a\nmissing POKéMON.\nHear him out, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaaah!\nBONSLY, where have you gone?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sorry...\nI'm at my wit's end...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're familiar with the news about the ship\nS.S. LIBRA's disappearance?\nMy granddaughter's POKéMON was on board,\nand it vanished with the ship.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The POKéMON is one I found while tending\nto my garden.\nIt was among my tiny bonsai trees.\nIt's a new species, I'm certain of it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, I implore you!\nPlease find my missing POKéMON if only for my\ngranddaughter's sake!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, thank you!\nYou are so kind!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our POKéMON is named BONSLY.\nIt looks very much like a potted plant.\nPlease help us!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My granddaughter has a photo of BONSLY.\nPlease ask her if you may see it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll try collecting\ninformation on our own, but to be honest,\nit's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For the time being, there may\nbe nothing we can do but gather information\nwhile tracking CIPHER's movements.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]?\nYour clothes are covered in sand.\nWhat happened to you?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had happened in\nthe northern desert.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's big news!\nThat could be CIPHER's new hideout![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But it may be too difficult for\nan ordinary scooter to cross the desert.\nIt won't be easy getting there to investigate.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, for help with something\nlike that, how about PERR in GATEON PORT?\nIf anyone can help...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes, that's it!\nGood idea, BITT![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PERR's an old buddy of ours.\nHe runs a mechanical parts shop with his\ngrandpa, MAKAN.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? You know the guy?\nWell, then we can cut right to the chase![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll get in touch with him.\nI'm sure he'll come up with the means for you to\ncross the desert.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please help us, if only for my granddaughter's\nsake!
[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll try to gather more\ninformation on the new POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In the meantime, [Player],\nyou should speak to PERR about your scooter.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It would be best if we could\nget information on what's happening in the\nnorthern desert as soon as possible.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We didn't expect you to know\nabout PERR.\nSmall world, huh?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: PERR's grandpa used to run\na junk shop in a town named THE UNDER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If it's anything to do with\nmachines and parts, leave it up to those two.\nThere's nothing to worry about with them.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I have a photo of BONSLY.\nPlease have a look.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please find my BONSLY![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I know I'm asking the impossible, but please\nhelp us.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I will wait with this child without losing hope.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's a little girl here who's\ncrying her eyes out.\nI feel sorry for her.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish I could help her...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There was something in the\ndesert?\nIt has to be CIPHER's base or something!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Isn't it dangerous for you to\ngo alone?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nHave you met the owner of the missing\nPOKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It breaks my heart seeing that\nlittle girl's sad expression.\nI hope the POKéMON is found soon![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nI guess you met the people that lost their\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But a lost POKéMON...\nCIPHER's acts seem to be sowing misery\nwherever they appear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We intend to settle things with\nCIPHER in ONBS's own way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, kid!\nYou look like you're raring to go, as usual!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But let me tell you, you may've\nbeat me yesterday, but don't think you can\nwin today!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I redid my training, you see.\nSo, how about we battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nI, CAIL, will show you my thoroughly refined\npower![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tch...\nIt's poor form to refuse someone's challenge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kid!\nYou're pretty good!\nIt takes talent to beat me, CAIL, after\nthe training I redid.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think I've learned how tough\nyou are with my whole body![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The ONBS...\nI'd like to go there.\nI'd love to be on TV even just once.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've gone out to POKé SPOTS over and over\nto catch new POKéMON.\nI haven't had any luck, though.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Even when I leave POKé SNACKS out for\nthem, they always get away.\nHave you caught any wild POKéMON?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, I envy you.\nIs it because I haven't been putting out enough\nPOKé SNACKS for wild POKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, I'm with you.\nIt's not that easy at all.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHIEF, please!\nI won't waste time chatting anymore, sir!\nPlease let me out!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I'm locked up, who's going\nto protect the peace of PYRITE?\nPow![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you perhaps the boy who\nwas on the news?\nA fine job you've done!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm impressed that someone\nso young as you would fight to protect peace.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm in your corner, too!\nKeep at it, son![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nI saw you on the news!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard about you from\nMARCIA, of course, but I didn't realize that you\ndid so much!\nI'm simply stunned![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to hand it to NETT.\nWe recovered all the deleted data without\na hitch.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ONBS is 100% back in business![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm planning on developing a program series\nmodeled after you.\nI've already come up with a title.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: "[Player] on the March--the Dawning of\nORRE's New Era is at Hand!"\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Isn't that a great title?\nI'm confident that the series will be a big hit.\nI expect big things from it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw you on the news!\nYou did some amazing things!\nEven SECC was surprised.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you seen the news?\nThanks to your exploits, we managed to get\nhigh-impact footage right from the scene.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll keep supporting your\nefforts by continually getting the truth out to our\nviewers.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's how we fight.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA's in the next room.\nI think she's already working on the next special\nnews feature.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She's doing that even after getting caught up\nin a serious incident.\nShe's one dedicated journalist![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you seen the news?\nI told you we caught you looking dashing and\nbrave on film.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Keep at it!\nYou've become a true hero now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, also, I have a favor\nto ask.\nPlease don't tell my dad, DUKING, that I was\ncaught up in a serious situation.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're getting tons of inquiries\nabout our news footage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This might even make\nme famous![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The news story about you was fantastic!\nYou're quite the guy.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Public response to your news story has been\noverwhelming!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We were buried by all sorts of inquiries like\n"Who is that boy?" and "I want him to marry my\ndaughter."\nIt was crazy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: SECC's news program is so\nimmediate and hard hitting...\nIt's eye opening...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to straighten up and\nwork so much harder so I don't get left behind.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I expect to see you even more\nin top news stories from now on.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I go out to cover a story with POFTY,\nit takes more time waiting for her to get ready.\nIt's a drag.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll work hard on my next\nstory, too.\nI'm going to own the number-one viewer rating,\njust you watch![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You say that you were on the news, son?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, it's only a news program.\nI've been in the news, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I took a tumble over a cliff when I was\nstill half asleep.\nIt was quite spectacular![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! I saw you on the news!\nIt really excited me!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought it was awesome\nwhen I heard about it, but it was even more\nawesome to see it on TV![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo!\nHow does it feel?\nYou know, seeing yourself on TV.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You may already be ONBS's\ntop star!\nToo cool![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We finally finished recovering\nall the deleted data.\nWe also managed to get back on the air, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's too bad CIPHER raided us\nbefore NETT finished analyzing that DATA ROM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But we're not beaten.\nWe'll just keep on collecting information![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], we hope you'll\nkeep going until every SHADOW POKéMON\nis saved from CIPHER's clutches.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you!\nI'm so glad that my BONSLY is safe.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope I can see my BONSLY soon...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nYou've met our BONSLY?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Unfortunately, neither I nor my granddaughter\ncan go deep into the desert.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], welcome!\nMy brother NETT's in his room as usual.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope you find that lost\nPOKéMON for the little girl and her grandpa soon.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Everyone's amazed at you.\nYou're the talk of ONBS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I should write a song about you, [Player]![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, how are things?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Say what?!\nYou discovered the S.S. LIBRA?!\nThat's huge news!\nWe've got to get a reporter out there now!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, it would take you to find\nthe S.S. LIBRA!\nYou put our reporters to shame![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm thinking about my next\nnews story.\nI wonder how I can dig deeper into CIPHER's\nnefarious plot.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe it's time I go\nundercover again and try to get the inside\nscoop even if it means taking a serious risk...\n...Bad idea.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Just don't tell my dad, DUKING,\nabout that serious mess I got in, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi!\nWelcome back!\nDid you find that BONSLY?
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's great!\nThat'll make the little girl happy!\nYou should go tell her now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, but that's not your fault.\nIt's like looking for a pebble in a desert.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're serious?!\nThe missing S.S. LIBRA is in the desert?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We'd better investigate that!\nWe'll need to get one of our ONBS crews\nout there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I think you\nshould concentrate on chasing CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If they're not stopped, all the\nmissing POKéMON may be turned into SHADOW\nPOKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The S.S. LIBRA was in the desert?!\nAww, darn!\nCIPHER's target was the POKéMON on board all\nalong?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That means the lost\nBONSLY...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You met BONSLY?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh, but it ran away.\nWell, I'm glad that it's safe at least!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think my BONSLY must be very hungry\nby now.\nI'm sure it will be looking for food.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, save my BONSLY![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nSo our BONSLY fled from the ship in the\ndesert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I haven't the faintest idea as to where it\ncould have gone.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The poor thing...\nIt must be crying out of fear and hunger...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our BONSLY must be out there somewhere\nsurviving on what food it can forage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, look for it again.\nI know that we've been a terrible burden, but we\nhave no one to turn to but you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player]!\nIt just figures.\nIt would take you to find that lost BONSLY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We collected data using ONBS's\nresources, but we couldn't find a trace of it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We sincerely appreciate what you've done\nfor us.\nMy granddaughter and BONSLY are overjoyed.\nSee for yourself.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yay!\nThank you!\nI believed in you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is something that stands for our gratitude.\nPlease accept it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a special BATTLE BINGO CARD, you see.\nYou can use it for BATTLE BINGO games at the\nREALGAM TOWER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's an event that's not open to everyone,\noh no.\nThe receptionist will know what to do if you flash\nthat CARD at the registration counter.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure you'll enjoy battling with BONSLY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you again.\nWe must be leaving now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], we made the\nright decision in asking for your help.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm amazed, though...\nThat POKéMON really was something we'd never\nseen before.\nThe world is still a vast mystery![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: BONSLY, huh?\nThat was the first time I've seen it.\nI guess there must be other POKéMON waiting to\nbe discovered.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyway, did you see how\nhappy those folks were?\nThe old gent, the little girl, and BONSLY?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing them, it brought\na lump to my throat.\nThanks for finding that POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That little girl was sniffling\nand crying the whole time.\nShe went home with a big smile, though.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It made me really happy to see\nher that way.\nDoesn't it make you want to dance or\nsomething?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], welcome!\nOh?\nThere's something about you...\nSomething's different.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you change your\nhairstyle?\nOr is it your outfit?\nUm... What could it be?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nI'm glad you're here.\nI've been waiting for you.\n...Huh?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What happened to your left\narm?\nWeren't you wearing the SNAG MACHINE on it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you kidding?!\nTEAM SNAGEM ripped off your SNAG MACHINE?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: NETT!\nCan't you do something?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No need to say it.\nI'm already searching.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nIt's no good.\nThere doesn't appear to be any new information\nwith regards to TEAM SNAGEM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It does appear, however, that\nthey aren't involved in any of CIPHER's capers.\nTEAM SNAGEM must be operating on its own.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM, huh?\nI thought they disappeared with CIPHER five\nyears ago.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nUnfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any\nnew information with regards to TEAM SNAGEM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It does appear, however, that\nthey aren't involved in any of CIPHER's capers.\nTEAM SNAGEM must be operating on its own.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to ONBS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I love how\nyou're always full of energy!\nI can learn something from you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Great!\nYou managed to recover the SNAG MACHINE!\nWay to go, [Player]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, wow...\nYou battled and defeated GONZAP to get it back.\nYou must be wickedly powerful in your own right.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're depending on you.\nWe'll investigate TEAM SNAGEM while you're\ngone.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That look on your face...\nYou're ready to infiltrate CIPHER's secret\nfactory, aren't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], knowing you,\nI'm confident that you'll be all right.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll have MARCIA on standby.\nShe'll be ready to go in and provide press\ncoverage whenever necessary.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll corner CIPHER in our\nown way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The S.S. LIBRA is in the desert...\nI guess it's impossible to get it out to sea again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER's secret factory?\nWhoa!\nThat's a blockbuster-class scoop!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please don't leak that\ninformation to anyone before I get there.\nThat's a promise to keep![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER's secret factory...\nJust hearing about that gives me the chills.\nI sure don't want to go there!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I bet MARCIA will be all eager\nto cover the scene in person.\nThis is so distressing...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey!\nYou got your SNAG MACHINE back from TEAM\nSNAGEM!\nGood going!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're back in the business of\nrecovering SHADOW POKéMON again!\nThat is really excellent![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], we're counting\non you to shatter CIPHER's nefarious plans.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, [Player], it's\nsomething that only you can do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM told you the\nlocation of CIPHER's secret factory?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That must mean they\nacknowledged your ability, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So you got your SNAG MACHINE\nback safely.\nThat's great.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou went to TEAM SNAGEM's HIDEOUT for it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow.\nYou really are fearless, aren't you?\nYou never fail to amaze me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou went to TEAM SNAGEM's HIDEOUT?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow.\nYou really are fearless, aren't you?\nYou never fail to amaze me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], how far have you\ngone from here lately?\nHuh?\nECLO CANYON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Th-that's outrageous.\nI've only made it as far as PHENAC so far.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, how're things with you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Say what?!\nYou not only found CIPHER's secret factory,\nyou also ruined it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nI'll give MARCIA's crew the green light to cover\nthat story.\nShe's been itching to go.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That MARCIA...\nShe's been itching to get out in the field.\nI'm sure she'll get out there like a rocket.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], take care.\nWe'll keep supporting you by reporting the\nhonest truth.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]~, oh [Player]~♪\nORRE's hero~\nThat's [Player]~♪\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Eek!\nDid you hear that?!\nOh, no, I'm so embarrassed!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I started composing a song about you, but it's\nnot coming together that well.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to watch all the news stories about\nyou again.\nI need to get a better image of you as a person![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nYou went and destroyed a factory that produced\nSHADOW POKéMON?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's mind blowing!\nI guess that puts an end to CIPHER's SHADOW\nPOKéMON scheme.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What? No?\nYou say CIPHER's headquarters are on\nCITADARK ISLE?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...But where exactly is this\nCITADARK ISLE, anyway?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CITADARK is a deserted\nisland to the south of GATEON PORT.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But of all inaccessible places...\nNo ordinary ship could ever get close to\nCITADARK ISLE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nIf there were some kind of special boat, it might\nbe possible to reach that island, but...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CITADARK ISLE is to the south\nof GATEON PORT.\nBut it's a forbidding place ringed by towering\nwaves and vicious whirlpools.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It would be impossible for any\nordinary ship to even get close.\nIf there were some kind of special boat, it might\nbe possible to reach the island, but...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo!\nI have to tell you, we were worried sick when you\nwent off to CIPHER's factory by yourself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're relieved to see you back\nsafe and sound.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CITADARK ISLE, huh?\nI guess CIPHER's finally getting cornered.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But be careful.\nThere's no telling what people will do when their\nbacks are against the wall.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], how far have you\ngone from here lately?\nHuh?\nECLO CANYON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Th-that's outrageous.\nI've only made it as far as PHENAC so far.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What to do...\nThe news crew we sent to the S.S. LIBRA hasn't\nreturned yet.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I want to send them to CITADARK\nISLE undercover, but who knows where\nthey've gone off to.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I knew that this was going to\nhappen, I wouldn't have sent MARCIA to\ninvestigate the SHADOW POKéMON factory.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my gosh!\nYou managed to reach CITADARK ISLE?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That means you've finally broken\ninto CIPHER's headquarters.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm getting shivers from excitement\nover this.\n[Player], give it your best![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?\nYou've been battling CIPHER on their home turf?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Awesome!\nThat's totally awesome!\nCIPHER's end isn't far off now.\nYou're simply incredible![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], where have your\nadventures taken you lately?\nHuh?\nCITADARK ISLE?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I... I've never heard that name.\nWow, [Player], you can go anywhere that\nyou want, can't you?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: These guys suddenly came\nhere, and they were really mean!\nI tried to make them stop, but...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: SECC is in a meeting.\nMay I get you to return in a little while?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had happened.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see...\nIt was TEAM SNAGEM's doing.\nIt's not surprising that they wanted your SNAG\nMACHINE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Up to five years ago, TEAM\nSNAGEM was in a partnership with CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But when they lost their SNAG\nMACHINE, CIPHER gave them up as a lost cause.\nI thought TEAM SNAGEM just folded after that...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They must have spotted your\nSNAG MACHINE somewhere.\nOh, my...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll start investigating TEAM\nSNAGEM right away.\nI'll let you know as soon as we discover\nanything.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, right!\nI'd forgotten completely about this E-MAIL\nmessage I received.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, ONBS got contacted\nby someone who claimed to have fled from\nCIPHER's base.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We debated sending out a\nnews team immediately, but there's no guarantee\nthat it won't be a trap or another risky situation.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hate to impose, but could\nyou go and investigate for us, [Player]?
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's not what I was hoping for.\nI thought this would be the perfect job for you,\n[Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, we need your help.\nPlease reconsider!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\nWe know that you can be entrusted with this,\n[Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The man who contacted us is\nnamed HORDEL.\nHe said he'll be at the OUTSKIRT STAND.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: HORDEL is supposed to be at\nthe OUTSKIRT STAND.\nCould I get you to meet him, if even just\nto talk?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: While you're off talking to\nhim, we'll keep busy getting information on\nTEAM SNAGEM.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nDid you meet with that man HORDEL?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmhm...\nHe said a SHADOW POKéMON factory?\nThis could be a huge story...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you very much.\nBut I think I'll keep this from MARCIA until we\nget a little better picture.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...She's prone to dashing\nheadlong into trouble without any heed for the\nconsequences.\nI can't let her out of my sight![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nI sent you an E-MAIL message about TEAM\nSNAGEM's whereabouts.\nHave you read it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It turns out that they're still\nholed up in the hideout they were using before.\nThey don't seem to learn from past mistakes.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Poor SECC.\nThat whole incident in PHENAC really seemed to\naffect him badly.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Being ONBS's chief, he couldn't run off to\nrescue someone dear to him when she was in\ndanger.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I were SECC, I wouldn't have been able\nto stand it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, perfect, lad!\nI'll have to work harder at catching wild\nPOKéMON so I don't get left behind!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The race is on, lad!\nWahahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nA wild [var_2], is it?\nWell, it's certainly true that it is a rare POKéMON,\nbut...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Laddy, you traded one not too\nlong ago.\nI'd like a different POKéMON next time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nLad, I don't see what I'm looking for in\nyour party.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe what I seek is in the PC?\nHow about switching the POKéMON I want to see\ninto your party?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's mighty fine!\nYour super rare POKéMON, I've got to have it!\nPlease, lad, I beg you!\nTrade it to me!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, which super rare\nPOKéMON will you trade me?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you disappoint me!\nBut if you have a change of heart, trade\nPOKéMON with me, all right?[dialogue_end]


[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, lad.\nYour [var_2] is holding the item\n[some_item_2D].\nWill you trade it to me anyway?
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's the spirit!\nI like your generosity, lad!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, we'll make the trade of\nyour [var_2] for my [var_3].\nAre you all right with this?
[Player]'s [var_2] was traded for\nDUKING's [var_3].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's mighty fine!\nWonderful, lad!\nI've accepted your [var_2]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm counting on you to raise\nmy [var_3] with care and love, lad![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I get this feeling that the ORRE\nREGION's becoming more tense and fearful.\nIt'd be great if my gut impression is wrong, but...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If my impression is right, it's no\ntime for silliness like dressing up in costumes...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nThat's off the record!\nPretend you never heard that, okay?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not like I said anything like,\n"I want to wear ladies' dresses."[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello.\n...Wait!\nWeren't you on the news?\nYes, I'm sure of it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm amazed you're so young!\nAnd yet you've bested CIPHER.\nThank you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's terrible that CIPHER is back\nto their criminal ways.\nThey can't be allowed to get away with it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What gets me even more is how\nthey tricked people with disguises.\nBecause I think disguises are for making people\nhappy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, by the way, I might not look\nlike much, but I'm a master of disguises.\nI've tricked CIPHER countless times!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I can't leave this place now,\nso the best I can do is cheer you on.\nKeep up the good fight![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi!\nDid you see it?\nThe news, I mean.\nIt was startling!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They found that missing S.S.\nLIBRA in the desert.\nIncredible.\nSome things in life are just unbelievable, I guess.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I had to give an example,\nit'd be about as incredible as my hobby of\nsleeping while wearing my PLUSLE costume.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nThat's off the record!\nPretend you never heard that, okay?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not like I said anything like,\n"PLUSLE is so sweetly adorable."[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi!\nDid you see it?\nThe news, I mean.\nWasn't it shocking?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Who would've thought that\nCIPHER headquarters would be at that place.\nI guess their days are numbered now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I heard that, it sparked\nan urge in me.\nI have this uncontrollable urge to disguise myself\nand sneak onto CITADARK ISLE!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I might not look like much, but\nI'm a master of disguise.\nI can't remember how often I've tricked CIPHER!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nI've got to snap out of this!\nI can't leave this place!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll cheer you on from here.\nI'll be hoping for the destruction of CIPHER.[dialogue_end]
There is something shiny between some books.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, now.\nI'll tell you some POKéMON tales later on.\nBut right now, I need some peace and quiet.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boo!\nI'm bored!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's all my dad does now!\nI know he has to study POKéMON, but I wish he'd\nplay with me, too.[dialogue_end]
There is something shiny between some books.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey!\nNo, no!\nPlease don't touch that![dialogue_end]
There is something shiny between some books.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's a BATTLE CD.\nDo you know what BATTLE SIMs are?\nHahaha, I guess you wouldn't yet.[dialogue_end]
There is something shiny between some books.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, hey!\nWe can't have you touching stuff without\npermission![dialogue_end]
There is an empty case between some books.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey, little dude.\nDo you like BATTLE SIMs?\nIf you'd like, you're welcome to take that\nBATTLE CD, and...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, wait a second.\nThere's no BATTLE CD in the case.\nThat's strange. Is someone using it?\nI'll find it for you by the next visit.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sorry, little dude.\nI haven't found that BATTLE CD yet.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Daddy's been busy all the time studying\nPOKéMON lately...\nHe won't play with me...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm conducting research into wild POKéMON.\nI'm sure my son will be delighted![dialogue_end]
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, now!\nThis is where we keep sets and props.\nIt's not safe, so scram...\nHuh? A BATTLE CD?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This room is only for big stuff!\nIt's no place for something that small.\nKid, go ahead, take it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I grow up, I'm going to meet all kinds\nof wild POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: To go on a POKéMON-catching expedition with\nmy son one day...\nThat's my dream.[dialogue_end]
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you like BATTLE SIMs?\nYou're way behind the times!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now don't be rude!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sorry about my son.\nI must say I'm impressed that you're familiar with\nboth BATTLE SIMs and wild POKéMON, especially\nat your young age.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've decided to take my son to a POKé SPOT\nsoon.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, feel free to take that BATTLE CD.\nI decided that I would rather show my son real\nPOKéMON in the wild.[dialogue_end]
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, that BATTLE CD!\nOh, sheesh!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Ahem.\nThat BATTLE CD features PLUSLE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I was going to give it to DUKING\nbecause he has this thing for PLUSLE, but lately\nhe's been completely absorbed in studying wild\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Actually, I used that BATTLE CD\nas reference for making a PLUSLE costume.\nI'd like you to keep that a secret, though.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you like BATTLE SIMs?\nYou should take that BATTLE CD, then.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: BATTLE SIMs are fun and all,\nbut I hope you'll take in some of our\nCOLOSSEUM challenges, too.[dialogue_end]
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, kid.\nDo you like BATTLE SIMs?\nThat's excellent to hear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're too busy at ONBS, so we don't get to go\nvery often.\nIf you play, you can take that with you.\nDon't worry about it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nWe got our missing BATTLE CD back.\nYou can have it if you'd like.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're too busy here to go very often, if at all.\nSo go ahead, take it.\nThere's nothing to worry about.[dialogue_end]
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, that?\nIt's something CIPHER dropped in their haste to\nescape.\nYou're welcome to it, if you'd like.[dialogue_end]
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], are you interested\nin BATTLE CDs, too?\nThey're quite amusing, aren't they?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I beg your pardon?\nOh, no, I don't do BATTLE SIMs.\nWhat I'm interested in are the BATTLE CDs\nthemselves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The technology that went into\nthem is quite remarkable.\nOh, that's right.\nI have old analytical data on them somewhere.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, NETT.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nNETT's always like this.\nWhen something catches his attention, he\ndoesn't hear a thing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You can take that BATTLE CD.\nTake a break from your adventure for a change.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nNETT's always like this.\nWhen something catches his attention,\nhe doesn't hear a thing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Dear, can't you see that a lady is getting\nready?\nPlease don't come in any closer.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, hey!\nWe can't have you wandering around here!\nIt's not safe.\nCome on, out you go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to ONBS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: SECC and his people have been\nvery busy after you told them that CITADARK\nISLE is CIPHER's base.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, [Player], I bet\nyou're terribly busy, too.\nI hope you succeed.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHIEF...\nThe man's forgotten completely about me...\nPow...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Consider CIPHER's capers.\nThe PHENAC CITY takeover bid.\nThe taking of the S.S. LIBRA.\nCIPHER's acts have been on a massive scale.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Where does CIPHER get the\nmoney to finance its huge capers?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If we trace where they're getting\nthe money from, it may be possible to determine\nwho is the leader of CIPHER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's excellent that CIPHER's\nheadquarters have been located.\nBut the location being where it is, we need to\ndevise the means of getting there first...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you have any good ideas,\nplease share them with us.\nWe're relying on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been told by NETT to not allow anyone\nthrough.\nHe's checking the news stories.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They're recording the news show on the\nsecond floor right now.\nWhy don't you go check that out?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nI heard from PROF. KRANE about how you\nrescued a lot of POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let us do an in-depth profile on\nyou soon, okay?\nWe'll be looking forward to it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Whoops.\nI don't have the time to waste, sorry![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We broadcast TV signals all\nacross the ORRE REGION.\nI hope you'll take the time to see how we work.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're welcome to wander \nthroughout the BUILDING and observe how ONBS\noperates.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Um...\nI think they said the ROCK POKé SPOT.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The hottest thing going today has to be wild\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou've been to POKé SPOTS?\nOh, wow, you're really up on things![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MARCIA's gone off to check out CIPHER's\nSHADOW POKéMON factory.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She's a journalist through and through![dialogue_end]
The little girl joined the party.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nYou came for us?!\nThank you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please have a look at this\nSHROOMISH.\nIt's had no energy at all lately.\nWhat could be wrong with it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[Player] made SHROOMISH listen to\nthe VOICE CASE.[dialogue_end]
SHROOMISH's POKéMON TRANSLATOR became\ndetached.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Shroo...\nShroo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, the SHROOMISH cried!\nI'm so glad!\n[Player], thank you!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: This phenomenon has been seen\namong POKéMON in places like GATEON PORT\nand PHENAC, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder what is going on?\nI hope all the afflicted POKéMON get well soon...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Shrooo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bobobonsly![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you met DUKING?\nThat man's turned a little obsessive about going\naround to his POKé SPOTS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't expect to see him back here anytime\nsoon.\nGive the man a little time, then come back.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, could you go back to the ship once\nmore and bring our BONSLY back?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I saw it lurking among my potted bonsai\ntrees, it would scoot off and hide as soon as it\nnoticed me getting closer.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I had to sneak up to it without making a sound\nwhen I finally caught it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I know that we're asking a lot, but we have no\none to turn to but you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our BONSLY must be out there somewhere\nsurviving on what food it can forage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, look for it again.\nI know that we've been a terrible burden, but we\nhave no one to turn to but you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nI'm sorry, but it looks like I'll need a little more\ntime to analyze that DATA ROM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: How about you make the rounds\nof the POKé SPOTS while you wait?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: NETT is a techno wizard.\nHe'll have that DATA ROM analyzed thoroughly,\nI'm sure of it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He needs a little more time,\nthough.\nMake a tour of the POKé SPOTS and wait for him,\nall right?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeahah, lad!\nHave you perhaps caught a [var_2] or a\n[var_3]?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeahah, lad!\nHave you caught a [var_2]?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wild POKéMON returned to the ORRE REGION,\ndidn't they?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: While I was traveling, I was thinking that the\nland was getting better.\nI'm really happy to hear the POKéMON are back\nin the wild.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're still keeping at it!\nI really look forward to reporting on your latest\nexploits![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank goodness.\nIt's finally peaceful.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is AGATE VILLAGE.\nWe're famous for the RELIC STONE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You can consider this a retirement village.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Elderly TRAINERS and POKéMON lead quiet\nlives here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I like the look of determination\nin your eyes.  When TRAINERS lock eyes with\neach other, there's only one thing to do--battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fwofwo!\nThis gets my blood pumping![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how boring.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A fine battle that was!\nHighly enjoyable, indeed!\nLet us battle again sometime![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, youngster!\nWhat say we battle again?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes?\nOh, you've come calling on EAGUN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: EAGUN's house is right there.\nBut he went out earlier and hasn't returned.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He went running off shouting something\nabout someone coming or not coming.\nI can't quite remember, though.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I have to hand it to EAGUN for his youthful\nenergy, though.\nI swear, he must run faster than I can.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard this child calling for me, so I came\nrunning to see what was the matter.\nWell, I found something quite nice.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I know!\nWe should have a battle, and if you can beat me,\nI'll happily give you what I found.\nWould you like to give it a try?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah yes, a fine answer.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how disappointing.\nI had rather been looking forward to a battle\nwith you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here you are, then.\nJust as I promised, here is your prize.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure you'll find it useful.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A battle is such a good thing.\nI feel rejuvenated after every match.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you wish to have another\nbattle with me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well, isn't that flattering![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, so you won't.\nIt would be nice if you could humor an old\nwoman like me every so often.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A battle is such a good thing.\nI feel rejuvenated after every match.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gaw! Gaw![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tatata loooow![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh my, my.\nIt's quite rare to see a child visitor in our\nvillage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nAren't I a kid, too?\nI may be young in body, but old in heart![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The villagers are all retired now, but they\nwere all outstanding TRAINERS in their younger\ndays.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why I came here.\nI wanted to learn the ins and outs of battling\nfrom the people here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My older brother trained here before, and he\nbecame very skilled.\nI hate losing to him!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But when it gets right down to it, the more\nyou battle, the tougher you become.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So how about we battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's what I want to hear!\nHere goes![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww!\nThat's no fun![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got a lot to learn if I'm\nlosing to someone like you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to study a lot more\nabout battling![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to stay here until\nI become a better TRAINER.\nLet me test how good I am with you.\nReady?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you're here to see EAGUN?\nI saw him tearing around the village in a huge\nrush a little earlier.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe BELUH would know where he went.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tadadad![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, gosh!\nThere's no path out of the village this way!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa!\nDon't startle me like that!\nOr are you looking for a battle with me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're on!\nI'm feeling frustrated over getting lost, so I'll\ntake it out on you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're not looking to battle,\nleave me alone, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I came to have a look at the\nRELIC STONE, but they won't let me in.\nAnd now I can't find my way out of here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm about to cry from\nfrustration![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Moan...\nI looped back here again!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa!\nDon't you dare startle me like that again!\nOh, it's you again!\nWhat do you want? A battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: My dream is to become the\nPOKéMON CHAMPION one of these days.\nThen, after I retire, I'm going to live here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To make that dream come\ntrue, I've got to become a lot tougher.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And to get a lot tougher...\nIt takes battles!\nRight?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yahoo!\nMuch obliged, pal![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tch!\nHow do you like that?\nYou couldn't help a guy trying to make his\ndream come true?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing to a kid like you...\nMy dream of becoming the CHAMPION is nothing\nbut a pipe dream![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I won't abandon my dream of\nbecoming the CHAMPION!\nCome on, let's battle!\n
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is the entrance to the RELIC FOREST,\nwhere you'll find the RELIC STONE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But today, there will be some special battles.\nSo I can't let you into the FOREST.\nIf you're sightseeing, try another place.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, you must be the [Player] that EAGUN\nwas talking about.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard that you battle to open the hearts\nof SHADOW POKéMON.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The RELIC is through this cave.\nDon't give up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here, son.\nLet me have a look at your POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-huh! Very good!\nAll your POKéMON appear to be good.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh...\nThere seems to be at least one POKéMON that\nhasn't opened its heart to you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that why you're here?\nOur village's RELIC has the power to open up\nthe hearts of POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Some time ago, oh I guess it would be years\nnow, the RELIC was used to open the hearts of\nmany POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Busken![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My dad's getting on in age, becoming more\nand more forgetful.\nLately, he's been saying nonsense.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: "I saw a WAILORD flying up in the sky!"\nWhen he started spouting that...\nIt depressed me no end.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But it's true...\nThere really was a WAILORD flying way up high\nin the sky.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nYour face clearly shows disbelief.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nYou must think that old SENILOR must be adrift\nin dreamland![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: But it's true...\nThere really was a WAILORD flying way up high\nin the sky.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nYour face clearly shows disbelief.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nYou must think that old SENILOR must be adrift\nin dreamland![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wobbu![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The DAY-CARE LADY retired.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But not to worry.\nHer granddaughter's supposed to take over the\nDAY-CARE business.\nShe went to bring the new girl here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sometimes, it doesn't matter how strong\nPOKéMON are in a battle.\nIf the TRAINER doesn't know how to use items\nproperly, the battle could be lost.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why I think it's important to buy \na good mix of items that're\ngood for every conceivable situation.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you heard the news?\nSomeone abducted the director of a research \nlab somewhere.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Isn't it scary?\nIt was finally becoming peaceful after CIPHER\ndisappeared, but now this happens.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nFor some reason, I feel dull and listless.\nI seem to have no energy at all.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been wearing these new sandals with\nraised nubs on the insole.\nI was told it was a great invention, but does it\nactually do anything for my health?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you know SENILOR?\nHe's an old man who's been living here for many\nyears.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, SENILOR says that he saw a WAILORD\nflying high up in the sky.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that's true, it would be fantastic, I guess.\nBut if he mistook something for a flying\nWAILORD, what did he really see?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, what a darling TRAINER\nyou are!\nI'm BELUH.\nDid you want something of me?\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nEAGUN, you say.\nAh, so you've come calling to see my husband.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you perhaps\n[Player]?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, just as I thought!\nYou are [Player]!\nWe've been expecting you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh...\nUh-oh, then are you maybe...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Peddling those ridiculous\ninventions of DR. KAMINKO's?\nIf that's the case, I'll ask you to leave.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We got word about you from\nLILY, you see.\nWe understand that you want to purify SHADOW\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The instant my husband heard\nfrom LILY, why, you should have seen his\nexcitement and enthusiasm.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Shouting, "This calls for my\nservices!" or some such, he went off running\nto who knows where.\nHe hasn't come back since.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: BELUH, dear!\nI've got everything ready!\nWe're ready for our visitor from the HQ LAB\nwhenever he arrives... Oh?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello, dear.\nOur guest, [Player], has just arrived.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, so you're [Player]!\nWe've been waiting!\nI'm EAGUN!\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard everything that\nLILY had to say.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As you know, to purify\na SHADOW POKéMON, it must open its heart to\nthe TRAINER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: While there are several\napproaches, battles are the best, no doubt at all!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The place to do that here is\nin the RELIC FOREST, which is home to the\nRELIC STONE.\nI will go ahead and wait for you there![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My husband is so impatient,\nas you've just seen.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In his day, he was hailed\nas the greatest TRAINER.\nBut that's a long time ago.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The cave to the RELIC\nFOREST is down the slope beside the POKéMON\nCENTER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Good luck purifying your\nSHADOW POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll help you purify your\nSHADOW POKéMON by having a battle with you.\nAre you ready to get started?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou don't have a SHADOW POKéMON in your\nparty?\nThen, there's no point in us battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come back, and bring at least\none SHADOW POKéMON with you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll help you purify your\nSHADOW POKéMON by having a battle with you.\nAre you ready to get started?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nThen let's get with it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nWe're not going to battle?\nWell, just give me the word when you're in the\nmood to battle.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: To open up the closed heart of\na SHADOW POKéMON, entering it in battles is\neffective.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why you should make\nSHADOW POKéMON battle whenever possible.\nI hope your SHADOW POKéMON get purified\nsoon![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], aren't you?\nI heard about you from EAGUN.\nLet's battle right away!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nThere's no SHADOW POKéMON in your party?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This battle is to help\npurify SHADOW POKéMON.\nHurry up and go bring at least one.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], aren't you?\nI heard about you from EAGUN.\nLet's battle right away!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here we go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, weren't you ready to battle?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wasn't that a good battle?\nI learned something from it, too.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nYou know how a SHADOW POKéMON sometimes\nbegins behaving strangely in battle?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that happens, calling out to\nthat SHADOW POKéMON is supposed to help.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, [Player]!\nLet's get on with the purifying of SHADOW\nPOKéMON!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well.\nLet this old woman come to the aid of pitiful\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nBut you have not one SHADOW POKéMON in your\nparty.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There isn't much that I can do\nto help, then.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well.\nLet this old woman come to the aid of pitiful\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you ready to begin?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder how our battle will\nturn out?\nI'm eager to find out.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, dear.\nOff you go, then.\nGet ready quickly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My, you are impressive.\nThat POKéMON should soon open its heart to\nyou.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nI should tell you this useful bit of information.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hear that if a POKéMON has\na closed heart, it's good to keep it with you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rather than keeping it in the\nPC Storage System, you should keep it with you\nat all times.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've kept me waiting!\nI hear that you have SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, but you don't have\na single one in your party?\nWhat good is that, then?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: At times an ordinary old man!\nAt others a plain senior citizen!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But my true identity...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The legendary TRAINER!\nEAGUN beat me!\nBut only him!\nI'm CRON!\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Now, now!\nFor the sake of your SHADOW POKéMON,\nwe shall have a hot battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bring it on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What, you don't want to do\nthis?\nI'm all pumped up and ready to go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It dismays me to see that\nSHADOW POKéMON have appeared again.\nIt's a sad world we live in.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a case to hold the\nSCENTS for giving COLOGNE MASSAGES to\nPOKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm told a scented COLOGNE\nMASSAGE helps ease open the hearts of\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rub down your POKéMON\ngently when you use that COLOGNE CASE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nWhat's that you say?\nYou have no SHADOW POKéMON in your party?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Quick!\nGo get one![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your SHADOW POKéMON\nshould be ready to open its heart after the\nbattles you've waged getting here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now I shall be your\nopponent.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And here's my partner.\nThe one POKéMON that I caught as my first...\nand that has stayed with me ever since.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Go, PIKACHU!\nOff we go to our first battle in five years!\nLet's keep things tight![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My goodness.\nIt was a white-hot experience, our battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And to defeat my PIKACHU...\nThat takes real skill![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Pikka pikaaa![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, let's see how your\nSHADOW POKéMON is doing.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, this POKéMON is on the\nverge of opening its heart to you!\nYou've done a good job looking after it.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well done!\nThat POKéMON has finally returned to its former\nself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For the time being, we should\nreturn to my house.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nThis POKéMON isn't quite ready to open its heart\nto you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should travel some more\nwith it, or perhaps give it COLOGNE MASSAGES.\nAfter it's been exposed to some more of your\nkindness, bring it back here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, if you would rather\nbattle, my four friends are waiting like before.\nThey're ready to do battle as often as you wish.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nThat POKéMON isn't quite ready to open its heart\nto you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should travel some more\nwith it, or perhaps give it COLOGNE MASSAGES.\nAfter it's been exposed to some more of your\nkindness, bring it back here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, if you would rather\nbattle, my four friends are waiting like before.\nThey're ready to do battle as often as you wish.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a cause for\ncelebration!\nYou've successfully purified your first SHADOW\nPOKéMON without incident.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Still, one can't be too happy,\nnot with the knowledge of PROF. KRANE's\nabduction.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, he was a frequent\nvisitor to AGATE up to several years ago.\nHe was conducting extensive research into the\nRELIC STONE, you see.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He said that it was for\ncompleting an entirely new purifying system that\nhis friend thought up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder where the\nkidnappers have made off with PROF. KRANE.\nIt must be worrisome for you, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: About that abduction, dear...\nDidn't you need to mention what VANDER saw?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nAh, yes! That's right!\nI needed to tell you about VANDER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We have a friend by the name\nof VANDER who lives on MT. BATTLE, which is\na place of training for TRAINERS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: VANDER claims to have seen\nsinister characters out in the desert, where few\npeople dare to tread.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've kept me waiting!\nI hear that you have SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you do, but...\nFainted?\nWhat good is that, then?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah? What's that you say?\nThe SHADOW POKéMON in your party...\n...Fainted?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's shameful!\nGo heal your SHADOW POKéMON at once![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The story of shady people in\nthe desert has me concerned, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should speak with\nVANDER in person for details.\nMT. BATTLE is to the northeast of this village.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: VANDER is an AREA LEADER\non MT. BATTLE, so you should have no trouble\nfinding him.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For someone so young,\nyou've already shown yourself to be admirable.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You have the air of someone\nwho is about to accomplish great things.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, dear, I'm sorry.\nThe instincts of an old woman like me aren't\nanything you could trust.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes, [Player].\nMay I have your P★DA number?[dialogue_end]
[Player] gave the P★DA number to EAGUN.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine!\nIf I hear of anything, I will make certain to get\nin touch with you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, I heard, I heard!\nThey say SHADOW POKéMON have appeared \nagain!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You brought your SHADOW POKéMON for\npurification, didn't you?\nThat's quite impressive![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou battled EAGUN, the legendary TRAINER?\nOh, you make me so jealous!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Not only that, you actually\nbeat EAGUN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Then if I beat you, it would be\nthe same as me beating EAGUN, wouldn't it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's it!\nWe've got to have a battle!
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's what I wanted to hear![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww!\nPlease don't say that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Losing to you means I'm just\nlike EAGUN, I guess.\nI can live with that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have you heard the news?\nThey say the man who runs the POKéMON HQ\nLAB has been kidnapped!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A ship disappearing, and now a brazen\nkidnapping...\nIt's turning into a scary world.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nIt looks like your SHADOW POKéMON has opened\nits heart to you.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: According to legend, that RELIC STONE is\nsaid to have CELEBI's power of time travel.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's said that the power makes POKéMON\nrecall their fondest memories.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you catch another SHADOW POKéMON, you\nshould come back here again so you can purify\nit.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: While I was riding out this\nway, I came close to being run down by a truck.\nI almost had a heart attack, I tell you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There was a whole lot of\npeople on it, too.\nThey were dressed pretty strangely.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They went roaring off towards\nthe desert without slowing down one bit.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you have a SHADOW\nPOKéMON, you should make it battle often.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Battling is an effective way\nto help open the closed hearts of SHADOW\nPOKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I learned a lot from the battle\nwe shared.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nYou know how a SHADOW POKéMON sometimes\nbegins behaving strangely in battle?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that happens, calling out to\nthat SHADOW POKéMON is supposed to help.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, if a POKéMON's heart\nis closed, it's good to keep it with\nyou on your travels.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rather than leaving it in the\nPC Storage System, make it your constant\ncompanion.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm told a scented COLOGNE\nMASSAGE helps ease open the hearts of\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rub down your POKéMON\ngently when you use that COLOGNE CASE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's the advice of an ordinary\nold man.\nHohohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll help you purify your\nSHADOW POKéMON by having a battle with you.\nAre you ready to get started?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYour SHADOW POKéMON...\n...Fainted?\nThen, there's no point in us battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Bring at least one SHADOW\nPOKéMON that hasn't fainted with you next time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], aren't you?\nI heard about you from EAGUN.\nLet's battle right away!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nOh, no...\nFainted SHADOW POKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This battle is to help\npurify SHADOW POKéMON.\nGo heal your POKéMON and come back with at\nleast one unfainted SHADOW POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well.\nLet this old woman come to the aid of pitiful\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nIn your party...\nFainted SHADOW POKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There isn't much that I can do\nto help, then.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], welcome!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bigga biggaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nSo CIPHER returned to its old desert lab?\nAnd the boss is a cute girl?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Uh, yeah, um...\nWell, that's not important, right?\nYup.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: EAGUN let me battle him long ago.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Back then, EAGUN was truly strong.\nEveryone looked up to him.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whaaat?\nYou're saying the truck that almost flattened me\nwas CIPHER's?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Not only that, you stormed\ntheir desert base and rescued that kidnapped\nPROFESSOR?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've decided!\nMy dream is no longer trying to become the\nPOKéMON CHAMPION, but to be your disciple![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Oh!\nSo you've found PROF. KRANE safe and sound!\nThat's the important thing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And the POKéMON HQ LAB has\nfinished work on the new PURIFY SYSTEM?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That is excellent news!\nNow, [Player], it's up to you to rescue\nSHADOW POKéMON for purification there.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I sense that you have much\npotential as a TRAINER waiting to be tapped.\nI'm sure that you will find success![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm glad to hear that\nPROF. KRANE was found safe.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, my goodness, I'm\nsurprised you went off and rescued that poor\nman all by yourself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a big difference from what\nmy husband was like as a child.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, he was a timid,\nfearful boy who couldn't bear to even touch\na BUG POKéMON.\nIsn't that funny?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I thought I recognized you!\nI saw you on TV with DUKING.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I was on TV before.\nIt was a show called "POKéMON Pride."\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess it would be back when this fellow\nhere was still a little WYNAUT.\nWow, it brings back memories.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nI saw you!\nYou were in my television!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: How on earth did you\nget out?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who would have thought it?\nI never expected to see wild POKéMON appearing\nin the ORRE REGION.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wouldn't mind catching\na wild POKéMON.\nIt's been such a long time...\nI can feel that old urge![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bigaga?\nBigibigaa![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, dear.\nI saw you on television.\nThey said they found places where wild\nPOKéMON appear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After seeing that, my husband\ncan't seem to sit still.\nIt's rather silly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nCIPHER is going to strike PHENAC next?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Those crooks!\nIf I had my own POKéMON, why, I'd take CIPHER\non by myself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh no, not PHENAC!\nPHENAC is where the DAY-CARE LADY's\ngranddaughter lives!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Could that be why the DAY-CARE LADY still\nhasn't returned from there?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're serious?!\nCIPHER's got their eyes on PHENAC?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And you're intending to thwart\ntheir sinister master plan?\n...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nMy dream from now on is to cheer you on from\nthe sidelines!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me begin cheering for you\nwith a battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? Did I hear you correctly? \nCIPHER's goons are going after PHENAC?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The DAY-CARE LADY happens to be visiting\nPHENAC now!\nIs she all right?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I swear it!\nA WAILORD flew![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, [Player]!\nI hope you've been keeping well.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nCIPHER is after PHENAC?!\nWhatever for?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nI'm worried about the DAY-CARE LADY who\nwent off to visit in PHENAC.\nAnd let's not forget the townspeople.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nThe people of PHENAC need your help!\nYou must go to their aid.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bibbigaju![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My goodness gracious!\nCIPHER is attacking a town?\nHow brazen and bold of them![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa!\nPHENAC's MAYOR has gone missing?!\nIs the town going to be all right?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nCIPHER is supplanting the townspeople with their\nown members?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Grr...\nWhat has become of the town's citizens, not to\nmention the DAY-CARE LADY who went to\nvisit PHENAC?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nYou've got to save the people of PHENAC![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bibbikajuu![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Replacing the townspeople\nwith CIPHER members?\nWhat happens to the people being replaced?\nWhere do they end up?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, wow!\nYou saved PHENAC?!\nThat's stupendous!\nYou're one stupendous fellow![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The DAY-CARE LADY retired and handed the\nbusiness to her granddaughter.\nBut she says the girl has a lot to learn.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hear that the girl can't take in certain kinds\nof POKéMON, but she's just getting started in\nthe business.\nI don't think you can blame her.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're serious?!\nYou drove off CIPHER after they took over in\nPHENAC?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Great!\nFrom now on, my dream is to be friends with\na great guy like you!\nGlad to know you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's cement our friendship\nover a battle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? Did I hear you correctly?\nYou routed CIPHER from PHENAC?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why the DAY-CARE LADY has come\nback.\nThank you, thank you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, [Player]!\nWe've heard about your courageous exploits in\nPHENAC from the DAY-CARE LADY!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I didn't expect anything less!\nAfter all, you're just how I was as a\nlad of your age, [Player]!\nBravo! Bravo, indeed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bikka bikkaju![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We heard about you!\nHow you drove off that terrible CIPHER.\nMy, you're such an inspiring figure![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! You're that boy!\nThank you sincerely for everything you did in\nPHENAC.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I just took over the DAY-CARE business from\nmy grandma.\nI still have a lot to learn, but I'm trying.\nI hope you'll trust me with your POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah! It's you!\nThanks to you, I was able to get my DAY-CARE\nup and running again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My granddaughter has much to learn about\nthe business, but I hope you'll bear with her and\nbecome a good customer.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My granddaughter has much to learn about\nthe business, but I hope you'll bear with her and\nbecome a good customer.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: They showed you on TV setting PHENAC free?\nThat's incredible![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi, it's you!\nI see that you've been on TV again.\nAnd this time, it was the news!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, hmm...\nI guess people do appear somewhat plumper on\ntelevision.\nYou look skinnier in person.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, [Player]!\nYour selfless heroics in liberating PHENAC have\nbeen all over the news!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I didn't expect anything less!\nAfter all, you're just how I was as a\nlad of your age, [Player]!\nBravo! Bravo, indeed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not very often that one\ngets the chance to compare someone on\ntelevision with the real thing in person.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I would say you look\nhandsome in person and on TV.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard from BELUH that you were on the\nnews over that terrible incident in PHENAC.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I had no idea that you were involved in\nsomething that big!\nIt certainly startled me when I heard.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There was a ship in the desert? \nAww, come on now.\nSENILOR does enough dreaming out loud for\neveryone here, believe me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey, if it's not the hero who saved\nPHENAC!\nHow are you keeping?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nYou say you found the missing S.S. LIBRA out\nin the desert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And you think that maybe that's what my dad\nsaw flying?\nI get it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So the S.S. LIBRA was that flying WAILORD\nmy dad claimed to see![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What is that you say?!\nThat flying WAILORD was actually a ship?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Land sakes!\nWhen did WAILORD gain the ability to transform\ninto a ship?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What is this world coming to?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How incredible!\nThe missing S.S. LIBRA ended up in the desert!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But how on earth did it get\nthere?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's more, what has\nbecome of the POKéMON that were on the ship?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You don't mean to tell me\nthat they've all been turned into\nSHADOW POKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What has become of the\nPOKéMON that were on the ship?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You don't mean to tell me\nthat they've all been turned into\nSHADOW POKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: From now on, I don't think\nI could ever be surprised by anything I hear.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bigabiba bigga![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nThe SNAG MACHINE was stolen?\nThat is a massive disaster!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But TEAM SNAGEM?\nI'm blazed and amazed that those cretins were\nstill around![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you know about\nTEAM SNAGEM?
[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM was a gang\nof thugs that robbed TRAINERS of their\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They would then supply CIPHER\nwith the stolen POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If your aim is to get your\nSNAG MACHINE back, I urge you to be careful.\nExercise utmost caution, lad![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: They are despicable brutes!\nIf you aim to get your SNAG MACHINE back,\ngo with extreme caution![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: They took your SNAG\nMACHINE?\nOh, how could they do such a thing?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But not to worry, dear.\nI'm sure that you will be able to get it back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, yes.\nI did see the S.S. LIBRA story on the news.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When it was first shown on TV,\nI thought it was a WAILORD.\nNo wonder my old dad made that mistake![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello, [Player].\nThe S.S. LIBRA is on the news.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But what became of the\nPOKéMON?\nI hope they haven't been hurt.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How on earth did they manage\nto carry that huge ship so deep into the desert?\nIt doesn't sound possible for people.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nYou destroyed CIPHER's secret factory?\nWell done!\nBravo!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That means that there won't be more\nnew SHADOW POKéMON appearing, at least.\n...Hm?\nIs something else on your mind?[dialogue_end]
[Player] told EAGUN what had happened with\nGREEVIL.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nCIPHER's boss challenged you to go to their\nheadquarters?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine!\nI'll go, too!\nLead the way to their headquarters!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nThey're on CITADARK ISLE?\nHmm...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If memory serves, CITADARK is\nan island to the south of GATEON PORT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, I've heard that the sea\naround the island is very vicious.\nEven the people in the area have shunned it\nfrom past to present.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Is there any means of reaching\na place so forbidding?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I had my heart set on cutting\nloose with my PIKACHU like old times.\nIt's disappointing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bigga bigaa![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's nothing I can do, then.\nAll I can do is cheer for you from here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I know!\nI'll send you E-MAIL to cheer you on!\nLook forward to hearing from me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nPlease don't try to do too much.\nYou will always be in my thoughts.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boating accidents and\nsinkings are common around CITADARK ISLE.\nI understand that people go out of their way to\navoid it completely.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Perhaps CIPHER took note of\nthat and deliberately built their headquarters\nthere.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, [Player]!\nHow goes it?\nAre my E-MAILS getting through to you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, very good!\nI'll keep sending you my words of\nencouragement by E-MAIL, then![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nNow that is odd...\nAm I sending E-MAIL to the wrong address?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nPlease don't try to do too much.\nYou will always be in my thoughts.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My husband and mechanical\ndevices aren't a good fit.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whenever he sends you E-MAIL,\nhe sits down with the instruction book and refers\nto it constantly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My husband has gone off to\nthe ORRE COLOSSEUM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He left with a bounce in his\nstep, saying, "I can't let [Player] take all the\nglory."\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Like always, as soon as he\nhears the word "battle," he gets all agitated and\nantsy for a real one.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't matter how old he's\nbecome, he remains young at heart.\nIt can get tiresome, hohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nYou've got your SNAG MACHINE back!\nExcellent!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, without that SNAG\nMACHINE it's impossible to rescue\nSHADOW POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've recovered your\nSNAG MACHINE!\nGood for you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I'm glad to see\nthat you haven't been hurt, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nYou say that TEAM SNAGEM stole your SNAG\nMACHINE, but you went and took it back?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'll be...\nBig things are afoot, it seems.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Still, I'm glad to hear that\nyou've recovered your SNAG MACHINE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, without that SNAG\nMACHINE it's impossible to rescue\nSHADOW POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My goodness, dear!\nYou keep getting involved in one crisis after\nanother.\nBut please, do be careful.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now there's a ship in the desert?\nMy, that's quite startling!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here's a little something that\nmay hasten how quickly SHADOW POKéMON open\ntheir hearts to you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wobbu wob!\nWobbuffet![dialogue_end]
[Player] received BATTLE CD 14\nfrom WOBBUFFET.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh well, now that's\na surprise.\nMy WOBBUFFET has this thing for shiny things.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, that BATTLE CD was its\npersonal favorite.\nIt must have taken a real liking to you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome!\nWe've just added POKé BALLS to our choice\nselection of TRAINER merchandise![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome!\nWe've just added POKé SNACKS to our fine\nselection of POKéMON merchandise.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to tell you, I'm overjoyed to hear\nthat wild POKéMON have returned.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe EAGUN anticipated that would happen.\nI wouldn't put it past that legendary TRAINER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now you should use the\npower of the RELIC STONE to finally open that\nSHADOW POKéMON's heart completely.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, have you heard?\nThey say the director of a lab somewhere has\nbeen rescued.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't know the details, but I'm glad to hear\nhe was found unharmed.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nYou've come!\nThank you so much!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, let's not waste any time.\nLike I mentioned in my E-MAIL..\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou don't know what I'm talking about?\nOh, dear, how annoying.\nMy E-MAIL to you was cut off.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, let me explain.\nLately, a strange affliction seems to have taken\nroot among the POKéMON in AGATE VILLAGE..\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you could, [Player],\nwould you be so kind as to examine the\nPOKéMON of AGATE VILLAGE?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how delightful!\nJust a little while ago, SENILOR's son came\ncalling for advice.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But since my husband is\naway, I can't be of much help by myself.\nThat's why I'm glad you've come.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There are five POKéMON in\nAGATE VILLAGE in total.\nPlease examine them all.\nI hope I can count on your success.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, that's too bad.\nBut it can't be helped since you are very busy.\nIf you have a change of heart, please come\nvisit me again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder what on earth is\nhappening.\n[Player], I'm counting on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This fellow here would always\nlend an ear to SENILOR when no one else\nwould listen, but now it won't say a word.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: It makes me feel so lonely...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...! ...?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm? What's wrong?\n...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The frustrated look on its\nface...\nIt seems as confused as I am over why it can't\nseem to say anything.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ever since that WOBBUFFET became that way,\nmy old dad's been depressed,\ntoo.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Maybe it is that thing...\nYou see, I fitted that WOBBUFFET with a\nmachine called a POKéMON TRANSLATOR.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: An old man in the POKéMON CENTER gave it\nto me.\nBut while it went on easily enough, the device\nwon't come off.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's got me concerned...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My old dad's been forgetful for a long time,\nbut...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, even WOBBUFFET seems to have\nforgotten how to use its voice.\nI can't figure out what's going on.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our COMBUSKEN hasn't been well lately.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Its piercing cry is its distinguishing feature,\nbut lately, it's gone completely quiet and docile.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This POKéMON here would bark and call\nfor me whenever it dug something interesting up.\nBut recently, it's clammed up completely.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What could be wrong with it?\nI'm so worried, I can't even put it in battles.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This LOTAD has always been rather vacant,\nbut lately, it's been even more absentminded\nthan usual.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like to share some BERRIES with you, but\nmy TAILLOW hasn't had any energy lately.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's very strange.\nWe'd just been to the POKéMON CENTER, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Not only that, I had my TAILLOW fitted with\nsome unique machine.\nThis has me worried.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nThe POKéMON TRANSLATOR?\nYes, it is I who gave them to the good people\nof AGATE VILLAGE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nThe POKéMON wearing my machine have been\nfaring poorly?\nHmm...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This old man loves new inventions.\nEven though they're usually useless.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, child!\nThere's no need to remind me of that.\nBut this isn't good...\nPOKéMON shouldn't be affected this way...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I was given those by, uh...\nDR. KAMINKO, I think it was.\nHe comes by with peculiar inventions every so\noften.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I have no idea where he lives, or\nanything of that nature.\nHmm...\nWhat to do...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DR. KAMINKO's inventions are often just\nstrange.\nBut they also have a unique charm that you\ndon't see in other items.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's what makes the act of inventing such\na noble and romantic endeavor!\nJust once, I would love to visit the studio where\ninventions are created.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This man has a history of being stuck with\nridiculous inventions.\nEvery time he gets a dud, he shouts, "I've blown\nit!"[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...![dialogue_end]
[Player] made the COMBUSKEN listen to\nthe VOICE CASE.\c
COMBUSKEN's POKéMON TRANSLATOR became\ndetached.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Bu...\nBusken![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My COMBUSKEN cried!\nOh, fantastic!\nThank you, dear![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My COMBUSKEN has turned even more lively\nthan before.\nThank you sincerely, dear.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Busken! Busken![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...![dialogue_end]
[Player] made the POOCHYENA listen to\nthe VOICE CASE.\c
POOCHYENA's POKéMON TRANSLATOR became\ndetached.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Gaw!\nGaw gaw![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nThat was the first cry in some time!\nHave you found something for me, sweetie?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POOCHYENA has gone back to digging\nup all sorts of things for me.\nIt's bursting with energy again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It would be fantastic if it could dig up\nsomething remarkable one day.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gaw! Gaw![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...![dialogue_end]
[Player] made the TAILLOW listen to\nthe VOICE CASE.\c
TAILLOW's POKéMON TRANSLATOR became\ndetached.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Low!\nTatatata![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nIt cried! I'm sure of it!\nOh, good, good!\nGo get BERRIES like you always do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My TAILLOW has been picking\nBERRIES for me again.\nIt's overflowing with power!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Lowlowlow![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, finally it cried.\nI guess that the POKéMON TRANSLATOR or\nwhatever it was called has come off.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nYou...\nAre you just always naturally vacant?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Tadad...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nCome to think, I don't remember ever putting\nany odd machine on it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tadada.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nThat vacantness seems to be catching.\nI'm beginning to feel vacant, too.[dialogue_end]
[Player] made the WOBBUFFET listen to\nthe VOICE CASE.\c
But nothing happened.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, WOBBUFFET!\n...Nope.\nNo response at all.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All the other POKéMON have regained their\ncries, but not our WOBBUFFET...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As a result, even my old dad has clammed up\nand gone silent.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
The CRY ANALYZER started up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Still no good...\nWhat will become of our WOBBUFFET?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Neither WOBBUFFET nor my old dad will say\nanything, so the house has been ghostly quiet\nof late.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I feel terrible for the both of them.\nThey seem so sad...[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained the final method to\nthe man.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nOh...\nCould such a thing be true?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Dad...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wobb...\nWobbu?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wob...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wobbu!\nWo wobbu wobbuffet![dialogue_end]
WOBBUFFET's POKéMON TRANSLATOR became\ndetached.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wob!\nWobbu! Wobbu!\nWobbuffet![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, WOBBUFFET...\nThanks, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wob! Wob!\nWould you look at WOBBUFFET's happy face?\nI feel overjoyed, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wobbu! Wobbu![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My old dad's back to his\nchipper self again.\nThanks to you, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nI heard what you did.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Instead of just AGATE, you\nwent and checked POKéMON all over ORRE?\nIt would take you to do that, [Player]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But this whole silly mess...\nIt was that eccentric DR. KAMINKO's doing,\nwasn't it?\nDoesn't he realize what he's done?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I see that DR. KAMINKO,\nI'll be sure to give him a piece of my mind.\nOh, and this is a small token of appreciation\nfrom me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now we'll be able to live in\npeace here with our POKéMON again.\nThank you so much, dear.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you think it might be because of that\nPOKéMON TRANSLATOR machine?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That old man at the POKéMON CENTER sure\nlikes peculiar inventions.\nBut boy, this is really annoying.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So it was that weird POKéMON TRANSLATOR\nmachine causing trouble.\nI had a feeling that it might be the cause.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, you know, I haven't heard of any\ninventor by the name of KAMINKO before.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Testing peculiar inventions makes me feel so\nalive![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, now.\nThe RELIC STONE isn't that way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whaaat?\nYou're saying the truck that almost flattened me\nwas CIPHER's?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Not only that, you stormed\ntheir desert base and rescued that kidnapped\nPROFESSOR?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've decided!\nMy dream is no longer trying to become the\nPOKéMON CHAMPION, but to be your disciple!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's not waste any time here!\nLet's have a battle now!\nHere goes, master![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Y-you're indeed my master!\nYou're too strong!\nBut battle with me again, please![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Y-you're great, as always.\nIt makes it more worthwhile to cheer for you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Y-you're indeed my friend!\nYou're too strong!\nBut battle with me again, please![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Tad.[dialogue_end]
No quiz appeared!\nThis POKéMON TRANSLATOR appears to be\nbroken down.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nI heard about you from SENILOR.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He said you made his\nWOBBUFFET all better now.\nI guess that leaves only that LOTAD.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You can always find that\nLOTAD beside the waterfall.\nThere's not much left to do now.\nPlease keep at it, dear.[dialogue_end]
[Player] quietly made the POOCHYENA\nlisten to the VOICE CASE.\c
But nothing happened.\nThis cry does not appear to be that of\nPOOCHYENA.[dialogue_end]
[Player] quietly made the TAILLOW\nlisten to the VOICE CASE.\c
But nothing happened.\nThis cry does not appear to be that of\nTAILLOW.[dialogue_end]
[Player] quietly made the WOBBUFFET\nlisten to the VOICE CASE.\c
But nothing happened.\nThis cry does not appear to be that of\nWOBBUFFET.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've decided to go home, but\nnow I can't find the exit to the village.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm so frustrated I could cry![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PHENAC's going to be attacked?\nWill the DAY-CARE LADY be okay, I wonder?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She'd just gone to PHENAC to get her\ngranddaughter, the girl who's going to be taking\nover her DAY-CARE business.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It won't cry for me still...\nIs it really because of that POKéMON\nTRANSLATOR thing?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, you've met VANDER?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nCIPHER's old lab in the desert may be back in\noperation?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You intend to go to that\ndesert lab to see if PROF. KRANE was taken\nthere.\nGo with care.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, [Player].\nThis will do for today![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, sir!\nThat was a well-played battle!\n[Player], your battle skills have improved\nby an amazing amount.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I mean, it was impressive the way you handled\nthat big POKéMON with aplomb.\nYou took command of it as if it were the same\nas your EEVEE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't you think it's time that you consider\nraising other POKéMON besides your EEVEE?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm...\nNice try, [Player].\nYou came up just a little short.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you find it a little disconcerting to be\nwithout your trusty EEVEE?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Still, your aptitude for battling is very acute.\nIf you keep up your training, you will get tougher\nfor sure![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you have an incredible aptitude\nfor battling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you keep absorbing knowledge and\nexperience, you'll become an outstanding\nTRAINER.\nThere's no doubt about that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: BATTLE SIMs are virtual battle simulations\nusing machines.\nBut they don't lose a thing when it comes to\nre-creating the excitement of a battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've tested it out before.\nThe opposing POKéMON was incredibly lifelike.\nIt made me shiver even though I knew it wasn't\nreal.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's up, [Player]?\nDo you want another battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha, you've got energy to burn.\nAll right.\nLet's keep going.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sure thing.\nWe just had one. There's no need to overdo it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The operation of this BATTLE SIM SYSTEM\ndemands precision control.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, with my technique, there's utterly\nno problem!\nRest assured you're in my expert hands while\nyou're plugged in and battling![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, [Player].\nAre you done with training for now?\nYou must be tired.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But seeing you like this...\nMy, [Player], you've grown up to be a fine\nyoung lad!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], if only your father were here to\nsee how much you've grown...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nI'm sorry!\nI promised that I wouldn't mention that!\nPlease, pay it no heed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh yes, indeed.\n[Player], you have grown into such a fine\nand admirable lad.\nOh yes.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello, [Player].\nWelcome.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm writing up a summary on the basics of\nPOKéMON battles.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Like I said, it's mostly basic information.\nBut if you'd care to look, I've written my\nsummary on the whiteboard.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, the basics are important for a reason![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you, AIDAN.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way, I don't think I've seen\nJOVI since lunchtime.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], over this way.\nCome with me, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Go on, open that box and take\nwhat's inside.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: You're looking for JOVI?\nWe're supposed to be playing hide-and-seek\nright now, but isn't she around anywhere?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, maybe she's gone off to\nDR. KAMINKO's manor.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI's "it" in our game of hide-and-seek.\nI wish she'd find me soon.\nMy back is starting to hurt.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That MACHINE PART JOVI carried\nis on that big machine.\nThey put it on the middle part with the ring.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It went right in the middle.\nIt must be the most important part![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PLUPLU! MIMI!\nWhere are you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not fair!\nThey can't go on an adventure\nwithout [bubble_or_speaker]![dialogue_end]
The E-MAIL is cut off...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nIt's me, EAGUN!\nSurely you haven't forgotten who I am?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I sent you E-MAIL earlier,\n[Player].\nHave you read it?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nHave you finished training?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], this is the DIRECTOR'S OFFICE.\nDid you want to pay a visit to PROF. KRANE?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: But...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nHave you read that E-MAIL I sent you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nI've heard the BATTLE COACH singing high\npraise about you, [Player].\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard that your battling skills \nhave improved dramatically recently.\nThat's outstanding, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I sure don't think I'd stand much\nof a chance against you.\nAhahaha.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ssssnore...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Hunh?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Here!\nHere at the POKéMON HQ LAB, we undertake a\ngreat variety of research on POKéMON, from their\necosystems to battling...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh... Oh, it's you, [Player].\nYou scared me out of my wits![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You know, I'm so dedicated to my job, even\nwhen I'm asleep I constantly think about work.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hiya, [Player].\nI haven't seen you for a while.\nAre you doing well?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What I happen to be working on is a special\nmachine for catching POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's finally almost completed, my machine.\nI need to focus and work to get it done![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew!\nThis switch is okay!\nNext, to adjust this here...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Man, there's so much to do, I'm not far from\na panic attack.\nI might have to take a break!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, that's right, [Player]!\nIf you're going to take a break, don't forget to\nSAVE![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you want to hear about purification again?
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're in the midst of developing a system to\npurify SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: "Purify" is the term we use to describe the\nprocess in which a SHADOW POKéMON's closed\nheart is made to open again back to its natural\nstate.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, five years ago, criminals used\nartificial means to close the hearts of POKéMON,\nturning them into fighting machines.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We're developing this system to save such\nafflicted POKéMON.\nWe call this system the PURIFY CHAMBER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not necessary in today's peaceful times,\nbut one never knows what may happen.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If there's anything you don't understand about\nthe PURIFY CHAMBER, just ask me anytime.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player], welcome.\nOur project is at a critical junction, so we're\nvery busy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes!\nFeel free to use the PC and HEALING MACHINE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nIsn't your sister with you?\nIt's rare to see you without JOVI.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You two get along so good together.\nWhy, it makes me happy seeing you two.\nHohoho![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Have I seen JOVI anywhere?\nCome to think, I haven't seen her since lunch.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I panicked and sent the E-MAIL\nbefore I finished it, but I'm glad to hear that\nyou've received it!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, well now, that's odd...\nPerhaps I made a mistake when I sent the E-MAIL\nin a panic.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, that's not important.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I was inspired by your battle\nexploits, [Player], you see.\nIt made me want to have a battle with you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That said, [Player], there\nare countless TRAINERS that would be honored\nto battle with CIPHER's nemesis.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kyurururu![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My POKéMON and I, we're always together,\neven when we're sleeping.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you want to become friends with POKéMON,\ncompanionship is very important.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sshh, [Player].\nDon't blow my cover.\nJOVI will find me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been playing hide-and-seek with my\nKECLEON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess I've been hiding here for around two\nhours now.\nI must be a genius at hide-and-seek![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I haven't been to the KRABBY CLUB for\na while.\nIt'd be nice to catch RAZELL and DAZELL's\nshow again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A huge cargo ship just doesn't vanish into\nthin air.\nThey just have to be more careful searching.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The ship probably had engine trouble.\nIt must be adrift in the sea somewhere.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Rumor has it that there was a new POKéMON\nthat even PROF. KRANE has never seen on that\nmissing ship.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's very worrying.\nI hope the POKéMON on board are safe from\nharm...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nThis combination works, but this doesn't quite\nfit...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nI'm compiling the basic data for that big project\nof ours.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nWhat big project?\nWhy, it's the PURIFY CHAMBER, of course.\nDidn't you know?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay...\nAround this POKéMON, we place these regular\nPOKéMON like so...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The SNAG MACHINE is inside\nthat case.\nTry equipping it right away, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Stop, [Player]!\nNot that way!\nThe DIRECTOR was taken out the front![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I therefore decided to take\ncharge and organize a COLOSSEUM event.\nImpressed?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But before we talk, we must\nbattle, you and I.\nEn garde![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nThere is no need for you to hold back like\nbefore!\nThis time, go all out![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey!\n[Player]! JOVI!\nWhere are you two off to?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nI heard about you!\nSounds like you've been racking up outstanding\nscores on the BATTLE SIM SYSTEM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But instead of that virtual reality\nstuff, how about a real battle for a change?\nI'll be happy to battle with you anytime.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, that's the spirit!\nLet's get it on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay.\nIf you're ever in the mood, give me a shout.\nI'll be happy to battle with you anytime.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, that was an eye-opener!\n[Player], you've become a lot tougher\nwithout me noticing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nI'll train using the BATTLE SIM SYSTEM, too!\nThat's what I'll do.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hoo, boy.\nThe world of POKéMON is so deep.\nThe more I study them, the more I am inspired\nby the very fantasticalness of it all.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For example, you know all POKéMON have\ntypes and abilities, right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you keep those facts in mind and apply them\nto battling, you can always gain an advantage\nover your opponents.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Paiiiii![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI's been so rambunctious\nlately...\nShe's such a spirited girl.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She thinks that she can do\neverything that you can, [Player].\nEven though, of course, she's still a baby.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't think she's wandered off\ntoo far, but please find her, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's no wonder that CIPHER has\ntheir eyes on you.\nI must say I enjoyed myself tremendously!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure that the TRAINERS who\nhave gathered at the ORRE COLOSSEUM will be\ndelighted to face you.\nPlease, we'd very much like you to come.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The toughest TRAINERS in the\nland have gathered with you as the goal,\n[Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll be waiting for you at the\nORRE COLOSSEUM![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player].\nDo you know that old man?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He has this air around him.\nIt's pretty obvious that he's no ordinary guy.\nHe's too intimidating for me to talk to.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That old gent...\nHe was that famous TRAINER EAGUN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you're truly tough\nto beat even that legendary TRAINER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That old fellow has been standing there for\na good while now.\nIs he waiting for someone?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nI left a P★DA in your room, [Player].\nGo check it out.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: "P★DA" stands for POKéMON\nDIGITAL ASSISTANT.\nIt's a very useful electronic tool.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A P★DA can be used for E-MAIL,\namong other things.\nI'm sure that you'll find its many features useful.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's quite easy to use.\n[Player], I'm sure you'll have no trouble\nfiguring it out.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way...\nWhile studying SHADOW POKéMON, we made\nseveral interesting discoveries.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They relate to a condition we call the\nREVERSE MODE of SHADOW POKéMON.\nWould you like to hear about it?\n\n
[Player] obtained the P★DA![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player].\nHow do you like the P★DA?\nIt has some interesting features, so be sure to\ncheck it out.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way, after you find JOVI,\ncan I get you to help me with something?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like you to test a certain\nmachine for me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I know you're a skilled battler,\n[Player], so I think I can count on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I just watched your battle with EAGUN.\nThat was intense, I tell you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ORRE COLOSSEUM is the one place all\nTRAINERS aspire to reach.\nKeep it up, [Player]![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Big brother, there's an old man\nwith a really long beard standing outside.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When JOVI asked, he let JOVI\ntouch the beard.\nWhen JOVI tugged it, he said it hurt.\nIt must be real![dialogue_end]
It's [Player]'s room.\nBut lately, his kid sister appears to have the run\nof the place.[dialogue_end]
It's [Player]'s bed.\nTake a rest?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi, [Player].\nHave you found JOVI?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh.\nShe'd gone off that far?\nSuch a precocious girl...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I hate to bug you\nagain, but please go get JOVI.\nI'm counting on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's fun underneath CHOBIN's\nroom.\nHave you been there, big brother?\nIt's JOVI's favorite spot now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So JOVI was at DR. KAMINKO's\nplace after all.\nI guess she forgot about our game of\nhide-and-seek...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll stay hidden right here until\nJOVI remembers.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], have you seen JOVI?\nWe were playing hide-and-seek.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But JOVI's been gone a while now.\nMaybe she's playing in your room, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, [Player]?\nWeren't you with JOVI?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw JOVI with her MIMI earlier,\nso I figured you were with her, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A P★DA is a very useful device.\nI've left one in your room, [Player].\nDon't forget to pick it up.[dialogue_end]
Hey!\nThere's something on the desk![dialogue_end]
There's something on the desk.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nThe lounge is noisy, so I'm going to see what\nthe commotion is about.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The TV news just came on, so maybe\nsomething big happened.\nLet's go see, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, a cargo ship carrying POKéMON\ndisappeared without a trace.\nIs that really possible?\nI'm finding it a little hard to swallow.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wah! You startled me!\nOh, hi, it's you, [Player].\nIt's me, ADON.\c
There is an empty case between some books.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's a BATTLE CD used in BATTLE SIMs.\c
[Player] found a BATTLE CD![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player], are you interested in BATTLE\nSIMs, too?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE is crucial to this\nproject.\nWithout him, there's nothing we can do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nWhile investigating SHADOW POKéMON, I came\nacross very disturbing information.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's about the SHADOW POKéMON\nthat is impossible to purify.\nI think I've told you about that before.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It appears that the SHADOW\nLUGIA you've snagged is that SHADOW\nPOKéMON.\nIt's an outrage. It really is.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, so long as the\nSHADOW LUGIA has a heart, there must be a way\nfor it to be purified.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We've got to maximally use the\npower of the PURIFY CHAMBER and the regular\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think that's the important thing.\nI'm sure that the LUGIA will eventually open its\nheart to you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], please try your best\nto purify it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A SHADOW POKéMON will occasionally go out\nof control if its emotions run wild.\nThat's what we refer to as REVERSE MODE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When a SHADOW POKéMON is undergoing\npurification, its heart slowly opens as it gradually\nprepares to return to its natural state.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, its shadowy aura doesn't go away\nuntil purification is complete.\nThe SHADOW POKéMON sometimes snaps under\nits influence.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why a SHADOW POKéMON is more apt\nto go into REVERSE MODE the closer it is to full\npurification.\nIt's quite ironic.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When a SHADOW POKéMON is in REVERSE\nMODE, it will take damage from its own attacks,\nand it won't accept any item except a COLOGNE\nSCENT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For that reason, if a POKéMON goes into\nREVERSE MODE, make it come to its senses by\ncalling it or giving it a COLOGNE MASSAGE.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you sure?\nWell, I'm always good for information.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: One last thing, a SHADOW POKéMON can't\ncome out of REVERSE MODE on its own.\nThat's why you've got to look after it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: One last thing, a SHADOW POKéMON can't\ncome out of REVERSE MODE on its own.\nThat's why you've got to look after it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're beginning to get a much better picture\non SHADOW POKéMON.\nWe owe it all to you, [Player], seriously!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? W-what?\nI'm always just watching TV?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's not true!\nWould you like to hear about the research I've\nconducted?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The theme of my research is the standard\nmoves of SHADOW POKéMON.
[bubble_or_speaker]: First, let me summarize the characteristics\nof SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They have several sad qualities.\nThey won't evolve or level up.\nThey're not friendly.\nAnd they can only use SHADOW moves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But once purification starts, SHADOW\nPOKéMON are actually growing stronger and\nfriendlier within their closed hearts.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Check SHADOW POKéMON when they are\nbeing purified.\nYou'll see that sometimes they remember the\nstandard moves from their natural states.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When purification is complete, the experience\na SHADOW POKéMON has earned is suddenly\napplied.\nIt may learn moves or even evolve!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The standard moves that SHADOW POKéMON\nlearn during purification are quite often gentle\nand friendly in nature, I think.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that happens, it makes me think that the\nSHADOW POKéMON is regaining its natural form.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: See?\nDidn't my research help?\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to go back to\nwatching TV.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww!\nI really do conduct research, you know![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm making good progress with the data for\nthe PURIFY CHAMBER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I can just picture how happy LILY will be\nwhen this project is finally completed.\nEheheh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player].\nI've got to hand it to you--you truly came up\nhuge for us.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to you, we've also learned quite a bit\nabout SHADOW POKéMON.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me tell you about what I've discovered\nin my studies.\nIt's about SHADOW moves.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi, Mommy!\nWe're back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No, Mommy, you don't\nunderstand!\nBig brother was lost, so JOVI brought him here!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If JOVI weren't there, JOVI bets he'd\nbe crying by now saying he can't go home!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: SHADOW moves are special moves that are\nused only by SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If a regular POKéMON is hit by a SHADOW\nmove, it will sustain heavy damage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Conversely, if a SHADOW move hits a\nSHADOW POKéMON, it will not be very effective.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Also, SHADOW moves don't use any Power\nPoints (PP), so they can be used over and over\nwithout limit.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The number of SHADOW moves of a SHADOW\nPOKéMON appears to vary.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But we don't know all the details quite yet.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our research depends on how successfully\nyou snag SHADOW POKéMON, [Player].\nWe expect big things from you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll be happy to share my research findings\nwith you anytime.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nAll of us are analyzing the data that we get sent\nfrom your P★DA, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to that data, we've made many\ndiscoveries about SHADOW POKéMON.\nYou should talk to our research people for\ndetails.[dialogue_end]
On closer inspection, JOVI's attempts at\nmakeup became apparent![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I guess someone's taken it.\nI'll lend it to you when they return it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you'd like, you're welcome to take that.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nI've heard that you succeeded in purifying that\nSHADOW LUGIA!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Those CIPHER cretins said that it\ncouldn't be purified, but you've proven them\nwrong![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], it's because you\nnever shirked, and you gave it your all.\nSincerely, thank you, dear![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI must have been very tired.\nShe's fallen asleep in your bed again.\nShe's such an angel!\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's huge that you've managed\nto purify the SHADOW LUGIA, which CIPHER\nclaimed to be purification-proof.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This will be a major blow to\nCIPHER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What does JOVI have to do to get\nhim to lend JOVI those googly glasses...\nThink, JOVI, think.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What is it, big brother?\nJOVI is busy in a planning meeting.\nIf you're sleepy, you can use JOVI's bed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ZZZ!\nSSSSNORK![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], that LUGIA was\npurified because you gave it your all.\nSincerely, thank you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player], welcome back.\nWere you gone far away?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? The DIRECTOR?\nHe went downstairs just a little while ago,\nPROF. KRANE did.\nYou didn't bump into him?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi there, [Player]!\nI've been waiting for you!\nI wanted to show you the SNAG MACHINE.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, big brother!\nThe SHADOW LUGIA was really hard to purify,\nwasn't it?[dialogue_end]
[Player] handed the MACHINE PART to LILY.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Finally!\nFinally, all the SHADOW POKéMON you recovered\nfrom CIPHER have been purified!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess this won't be needed anymore...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All the effort you've put in has finally borne\nfruit.\nCongratulations, [Player]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Your efforts made all our research work\nworthwhile, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're fabulous, [Player]!\nYou've purified all the SHADOW POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nI've heard.\nYou've now purified all the SHADOW POKéMON!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's fantastic work!\nNow, POKéMON will be able to live in peace\nwithout fear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This is all your doing,\n[Player]!\nWe all owe you a huge thanks![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I should tell you, the SNAG\nMACHINE is an outrageous piece of work.\nAfter all, it's used for stealing POKéMON from\nanother TRAINER in battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But we didn't make this to\nsteal POKéMON indiscriminately from\nTRAINERS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you've heard of\nSHADOW POKéMON, haven't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They're POKéMON that have been\nturned into fighting machines after having their\nhearts closed by artificial means.\nThey're to be pitied.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We developed the SNAG MACHINE\nto take back such modified SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why this machine is needed now\nI can explain later...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, wait, [Player].\nWhere do you think you're going?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nI feel all nervous and excited.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, it fits you perfectly.\nIt looks cool, too, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll also add a new feature to your\nP★DA.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's called the SHADOW MONITOR.\nIt lets you check data on the SHADOW POKéMON\nyou've encountered.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's it, [Player]!\nThat's spot-on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's more.\nI wanted to give these to you, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nHow silly of me!\nI almost forgot to give you these.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In order to use the SNAG\nMACHINE, you need at least one POKé BALL.\nSo, I'll give you these.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aiyeeh! Aiyeeh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: From here on, it will be a lot\neasier to just show you how it works in practice\nrather than trying to describe it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's go upstairs to the BATTLE\nSIM SYSTEM room.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what's going on?!\nWho are you people?![dialogue_end]
PROF. KRANE can't be abandoned![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]...\nYou've grown so impressively...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER represents\nthe dreams of PROF. KRANE and myself...\nAnd of course your father's, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing you make use of the\nPURIFY CHAMBER so capably...\nI can't help but feel the tug of destiny.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Big brother!\nJOVI doesn't get it, but MIMI and the other\nPOKéMON are all very happy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you do something incredible?\nYou did, didn't you?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's terrible, [Player]!\nSome strange men came barging in and took\noff with the DIRECTOR![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's happening?!\nDid you hear screaming from the reception\narea?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew!\nThis switch is okay!\nNext, to adjust this here...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're kidding!\nSome shady characters stormed our HQ LAB?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: They're documents on SHADOW\nPOKéMON that PROF. KRANE and I compiled.\nPlease read them. [dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I heard a lot of noise coming from the lobby.\nIs anything the matter?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nPROF. KRANE was taken away by some strange\nmen?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's not a moment to waste!\nLet's get a move on. They must be still in\nthe area![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Really?!\nIntruders broke into our LAB?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what should I do?\nIt will be a disaster if our secret data is stolen![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Will you let go of me!\nWhere do you think you're taking me?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], the TEDDIURSA\nyou snagged probably isn't the only SHADOW\nPOKéMON that was made...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When the PURIFY CHAMBER is\ncompleted, we will be able to save many\nSHADOW POKéMON at the same time, but...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's complete it!\nWe'll finish the PURIFY CHAMBER ourselves![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Move it; we don't have any time.\nIf you don't want to get hurt, hustle yourself into\nthe car.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: LILY?\nThe DIRECTOR's not here!\nIt's hopeless.\nThere isn't any possible way to get it done.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Urgh...\nI got careless...\nI walked right into them when I rushed out...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mugyuu...[dialogue_end]
Whoa!\nHe's fainted![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fnngahh...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nWhat is it, punk?\nYou're going to play hero and try to stop us?\nI don't show mercy to anyone, not even kids.[dialogue_end]
[Player] obtained the SHADOW MONITOR\nfeature.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nThe PURIFY CHAMBER is almost ready.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I don't get it.\nThere's no need to purify POKéMON now.\nI wonder why PROF. KRANE and LILY are in such\na hurry to get the PURIFY CHAMBER finished?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nFeel free to use the PC and HEALING MACHINE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There should be other MEMOS\non SHADOW POKéMON.\nI'll see about finding them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, my friend, you be a good\nbodyguard to our princess![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The RELIC STONE in AGATE\nVILLAGE is said to be imbued with CELEBI's\nability to travel through time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That magical power must open up\nthe closed hearts of SHADOW POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nIt's my job to assemble the basic data set for\nthe PURIFY CHAMBER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Even if the CHAMBER is built, it will be\nuseless without this data![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kid!\nWhat is that machine on your arm?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Could it be...\nA SNAG MACHINE?!\nWhat the heck is that doing here?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's big news!\nCome on, move!\nI need to report this to headquarters, like now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're on the verge of finishing!\nThis isn't the time to feel sorry for\nyourself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER project got\nthis far not just because PROF. KRANE was here.\nWe got here because we all worked as a team.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Having come this far, it would\nbe wrong to stop now.\nOur pride as scientists is on the line.\nLet's finish the project as one![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Things will get very busy around\nhere!\nI'll go upstairs and check how the data\nprocessing is progressing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, [Player].\nDon't you need to chase after the DIRECTOR?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: LILY is the driving force behind the\nPURIFY CHAMBER's development.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Her whole team is very enthusiastic about\nthe project.\nI'm sure they'll come up with something quite\namazing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wasn't the DIRECTOR in?\nMaybe he's in the testing room on the ground\nfloor.\nPlease go find him.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: POKé BALLS aren't used in the\nORRE REGION, so we import them from another\nREGION.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, now we're set!\nLet's hurry over to the DIRECTOR.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waaah!\nThey took the PROFESSOR away![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't cry, JOVI.\nI'm sure PROF. KRANE will be okay.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sniff...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We've contacted the police and\nthe proper authorities about PROF. KRANE.\nThey should let us know if they discover\nanything.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I still can't believe that this is\nhappening...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE predicted that\nsomeone will again try making SHADOW\nPOKéMON.\nHis prediction was on the mark.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], we've got to purify\nthat SHADOW POKéMON you've caught\nsoon, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But the PURIFY CHAMBER won't\nbe ready for a while yet.\nWhat would be a good idea?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: They started running news about PROF.\nKRANE's abduction.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It would have been good to get exposure in\nany other way than as a victim of abduction...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sniff...\nJOVI hopes the PROFESSOR is okay...\nJOVI hopes he isn't hurt...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Will he wait until JOVI gets bigger\nand goes to rescue him?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing news like that only adds to my worries.\nI hope the DIRECTOR is safe...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It would be nice if people stepped up with\ninformation on PROF. KRANE's whereabouts\nafter seeing the news.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Shudder...\nIf those horrible men come back, they'll come\nafter me, I'm sure of it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We were so close to finishing\nthe PURIFY CHAMBER when the DIRECTOR was\ntaken away...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: No, no, no!\nThis is no time for moping!\nI've got to focus and work at getting the project\nfinished![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nHow was AGATE VILLAGE?\nDid your POKéMON's purification go okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Keep my back straight, like so, and smile,\nsmile!\nGrin!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: News crews may come here, too.\nOne needs to be properly ready.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boy, did I embarrass myself!\nRushing outside at them may've been brave,\nbut that's the only positive...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nYou want to know what purify means?
[bubble_or_speaker]: "Purify" is the term we use to describe how\na POKéMON with its heart closed is restored to\nits natural state.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Research on purification started here at the\nPOKéMON HQ LAB around five years ago,\nI guess.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It was after the "SHADOW POKéMON incident"\nwhen POKéMON with their hearts artificially shut\nwere used as fighting machines by criminals.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You don't suppose PROF. KRANE was targeted\nfor his research into purification?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay.\nI'm always here if you need information.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I get it now!\nI understand why PROF. KRANE and LILY were in\nsuch a hurry to get this project completed.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If SHADOW POKéMON are being made\nsomewhere by criminals, we have to restore them\nto their natural state using our system.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard, [Player].\nIt's so hard to believe that someone would\nabduct PROF. KRANE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, that's right!\n[Player], I heard you got a new POKéMON.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The BATTLE SIM SYSTEM simulates many\nsituations.\nWant to train on it now?
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nLet's get on with it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, you're right.\nI guess you wouldn't be in the mood for a battle\nat a time like this.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is it true that the DIRECTOR was abducted\nby thugs?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn!\n[Player], get stronger using my SYSTEM\nand teach the kidnappers a lesson they won't\nsoon forget![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's okay.\nYou don't need to hide things from me.\nI can take it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], do you remember?\nThe "SHADOW incident" five years ago.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A criminal syndicate named CIPHER plotted\nworld domination by producing SHADOW\nPOKéMON as their weapons.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fortunately, two brave young people defeated\nCIPHER, and the SHADOW POKéMON were\nrestored to their natural selves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This tale is becoming the stuff of legend\nnowadays.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how could they?!\nWho would kidnap our DIRECTOR, and why?!\nI demand answers!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh...\nI'm sorry.\nYelling at you doesn't help a thing, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Until our DIRECTOR returns, this LAB will\nlikely be overseen by LILY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: LILY has an exceptionally high sense of\nresponsibility.\nI worry that she may drive herself too hard.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're the only person that LILY can lean\non now.\nYou be sure to support her![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is it really true?\nWas our DIRECTOR taken away?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Really?!\nIt really is true?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But why would anyone want to kidnap\nPROF. KRANE?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh.\nSo someone was just trying to pull my leg.\nI feel silly for being all flustered.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, oh...\nI never imagined something huge like this would\nhappen while I snoozed.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If this is a dream, let me\nawaken now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's been one scary incident after another\nlately...\nIt's a cruel and scary world out there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you suppose maybe that the same bunch\nthat kidnapped the DIRECTOR also has\nsomething to do with that missing ship?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Who can pull off capers like that?\nCould there be anyone besides CIPHER?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If it really was CIPHER that raided the cargo\nship, then we've got big trouble!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All the POKéMON on that ship could end up\nbeing transformed into SHADOW POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: With our DIRECTOR kidnapped, the only\nthing we can do is to keep moving forward with\nour development work.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why LILY is working so hard to finish\nthe PURIFY CHAMBER as soon as possible.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nGood job!\nYour POKéMON's purification was a success!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought you could do it,\n[Player].\nAm I glad for you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Big brother, awesome!\nYou did that purify thing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But JOVI is even more, lots more,\nawesome than that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm still steamed over this.\nI wouldn't have lost to them in a POKéMON\nbattle, but those cowards jumped me without\nwarning and punched my lights out.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, by the way, did you see\nthem running off toward the southeast?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Their hideout could be\nsomewhere in the southeast![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Owowow...\nThat's one experience I don't want to repeat.\nIt must have been rough for you, too,\n[Player].\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: EAGUN sent word about you.\nIt sounds like your SHADOW POKéMON's\npurification was a total success.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Until the PURIFY CHAMBER is\ncompleted, that's how you'll need to do things.\nKeep it up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nAre you here for a battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nHow was AGATE VILLAGE?\nDid your POKéMON's purification go okay?
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's great!\nWhen the PURIFY CHAMBER is finished, we'll be\nable to save many SHADOW POKéMON at once.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hiya, [Player].\nI haven't seen you for a while.\nAre you doing well?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What I happen to be working on is a special\nmachine for catching POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou want to know if it has anything to do with\nthe PURIFY CHAMBER?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You called it.\nThis machine and the PURIFY CHAMBER are both\nthe results of the same project.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Having said that, I sincerely hope that the\nneed to use this machine never arises.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou want to know if my machine for catching\nPOKéMON has anything to do with the PURIFY\nCHAMBER?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You called it.\nThis machine and the PURIFY CHAMBER are both\nthe results of the same project.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Having said that, I sincerely hope that the\nneed to use this machine never arises.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Everyone's pulling together to\nbring the PURIFY CHAMBER to completion.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What happened to the DIRECTOR\nis worrying, but all we can do is hope that he's\nunharmed.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? You weren't successful?\nWell, there are several approaches to getting\na SHADOW POKéMON ready for purification.\nYou should try them out.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Awww, it's not fair.\nBig brother gets to go everywhere by himself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI wants to go on adventures,\ntoo.\nJOVI knows she won't lose to big brother,\nnuh-uh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When they keep running the same story over\nand over, I start getting a feeling as if the\nDIRECTOR were being kidnapped again and\nagain.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nDid you want to ask about purification?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you using the BATTLE SIM SYSTEM?\nWe'll support you with our research and\ndevelopment efforts, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sorry, [Player].\nAfter five long years, this project is finally on\nthe verge of coming together.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But for that to happen, we can't\ndo without your mother's expertise.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm so worried about the DIRECTOR, I'm finding\nit hard to concentrate on work.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But what would compel those people to make\noff with PROF. KRANE?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh... Don't panic!\nWhatever the situation, if you're going to take\na break, don't forget to SAVE![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whaaat?!\nPROF. KRANE was taken by some strange men?!\nThat's got to be trouble![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder if the DIRECTOR's okay...\nHe's a thinker, not a fighter.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Has AIDAN said anything to you\nabout the SNAG MACHINE?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I see, yes.\nWell, we've named the special machine for \ncatching POKéMON the SNAG MACHINE.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Those goons took off toward\nthe southeast that time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe their hideout is in the\nsoutheast![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, oh...\nNobody seems to know where PROF. KRANE's\nbeen taken.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's like I'm in a bad dream that\nI can't awaken from.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu...\nI'm taking you to your new lab, PROFESSOR.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What...\nMy new lab?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You people...\nWhat are you?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Blissbliss![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Plaplaa![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maimaii![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Quaaag![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Saiduur![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kek, kek.[dialogue_end]
Whoa!\nA KECLEON is hiding here![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The RELIC STONE in AGATE\nVILLAGE is said to be imbued with CELEBI's\nability to travel through time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That magical power must open up\nthe closed hearts of SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Best of luck with the purification\nof your SHADOW POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks to you, [Player],\nI was able to return safe and sound.\nSincerely, thank you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Though it was a horrible ordeal,\nI learned a few things when I was in that desert\nlab.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: First and foremost, CIPHER hasn't\ndisappeared!\nThe fact that they're still around is alarming.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Worse, they are making more\nSHADOW POKéMON again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And worst of all, they are trying\nto create the ultimate SHADOW POKéMON--one\nthat is impossible to purify.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER must be plotting world\ndomination using SHADOW POKéMON as their\nweapons again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To counter CIPHER's new\nSHADOW POKéMON conspiracy...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DIRECTOR! LILY!\nWe did it!\nThe PURIFY CHAMBER is finally completed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nWhat fantastic timing!\nIt's finally finished!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow...\nOur long-held dream...\nThe PURIFY CHAMBER is finally finished.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It stirs up emotions...\nIt's bringing up a lump in my throat...\nSigh...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Take a good look, [Player]!\nThis is the PURIFY CHAMBER!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], your father and I\ndesigned it five years ago when we were\nmotivated by the "SHADOW incident."\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If evildoers were to create\nSHADOW POKéMON again, we wanted to be able\nto save them ourselves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], your father believed\nthat passionately. \nTo honor your father's wish, I put together our\nPOKéMON HQ LAB.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], if your father were\nhere, I'm sure that he would be delighted.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But first, if you would be so kind\nas to briefly explain how the PURIFY\nCHAMBER works.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh...\nThis day has finally arrived.\nI'm on the edge of tears.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But there's no time for crying.\nThere's still work to be done!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER status is on standby.\nSystem status is good to go!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Step onto that circular plate.\nA holographic image of the POKéMON involved\nin purification will appear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, it would if there were actually some\nPOKéMON on the SETS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When you're checking the hologram, you can\nzoom to individual SETS.\nAt any selected SET, you can configure things\nas you see fit.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A control panel will appear for you to pick the\nPOKéMON you want to place on the selected SET,\nposition them, and so on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you bring some POKéMON, [Player], you\ncan place them on SETS.\nDon't worry, you'll figure it out when you\nactually try it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll also be around to provide advice if you\nneed it.\nFirst, check the hologram, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER is a facility in which\nSHADOW POKéMON undergo purification through\ncontact with regular POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Purification is conducted on what we call\na SET.\nThis is where a SHADOW POKéMON comes into\ncontact with regular POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In the center of a SET, one SHADOW\nPOKéMON is placed.\nUp to four regular POKéMON can be placed\naround the SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We have nine of those SETS here.\nThat means we can efficiently purify up to nine\nSHADOW POKéMON at the same time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There is one thing you need to be careful\nabout.\nPurification won't proceed if you place only\na single SHADOW POKéMON on a SET.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Purification can only happen if there is at\nleast one regular POKéMON on a SET with a\nSHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The number of regular POKéMON placed with\na SHADOW POKéMON, and their compatibility,\nare key points.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: First, the number of regular POKéMON.\nThe more regular POKéMON you place with a\nSHADOW POKéMON, the quicker purification is.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Next, the compatibility of POKéMON.\nCompatibility depends on the types of the\nPOKéMON involved, and the directions they face.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: By adjusting these factors, you'll likely see\ndifferences in purification speeds.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you need details, I'll be happy to explain\nlater.\nBut right now, I'd like you to check the SETS\nout.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you're looking for DATAN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw someone go outside earlier.\nMaybe that was DATAN?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, [Player].\nYou've got the honor of launching the PURIFY\nCHAMBER.\nIt's a moment to cherish.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER was your\nfather's dream.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, [Player], start the\nsystem with your own hands.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI wonders how it works.\nBig brother, hurry and make it work![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Great!\nWhen this system starts working, CIPHER's\nSHADOW POKéMON plan can be thwarted![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's been a long and winding road getting\nhere.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But now that we've finally finished, I'll forget\nall the trials and tribulations we had to endure.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nI've got a job to do![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll explain how the PURIFY CHAMBER\noperates.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What should I explain?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Snagging a SHADOW LUGIA...\nIt would take you to do it, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But this is no time for\ncomplacency.\nBe cautious until CIPHER goes down for good.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, [Player]!\nNow, all systems are go for purifying SHADOW\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Those thugs came after the DIRECTOR\nbecause he was researching purification.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They were going to misuse his research so\nthey could make SHADOW POKéMON that can't\nbe purified.\nIt's unforgivable![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, what should I do?\nMy knees are shaking.\nI feel so inspired!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please let me know if you want to use the\nPURIFY CHAMBER from now on.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER status is on standby.\nSystem status is good to go!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If there's anything you don't understand about\nits operation, I'll be happy to explain.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER was very\npretty, with things spinning around.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI wishes she could ride, too.\nWill the PROFESSOR let JOVI go on it if JOVI\nasks nicely?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The DIRECTOR came back safely,\nand the PURIFY CHAMBER was completed.\nWe can finally slow down and catch our breath.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After your father passed away,\nPROF. KRANE and I carried on with his studies.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If he were here to see this, I'm\nsure that your father would be happy and proud.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: How did you find the PURIFY\nCHAMBER?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Using this system, it's possible to purify\nmany SHADOW POKéMON at the same time.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, also, you can access the\nPURIFY CHAMBER from any PC.\nBe sure to try that feature.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, the issue is how SHADOW\nPOKéMON should be recovered from CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It looks as if you'll have to get\nbusy some more with the SNAG MACHINE,\n[Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, speaking of CIPHER... LILY,\nhave you made any progress with that DATA\nROM we brought back from CIPHER's lab?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes, I've asked DATAN to\nanalyze the contents of that DATA ROM.\nIt should be ready soon.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Big brother's tired, so JOVI\nwill go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, JOVI, it's okay!\nThis is for work![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha!\nSeeing JOVI and her boundless energy makes\nme realize I'm back home.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyway, I wonder what's on that\nDATA ROM.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, JOVI.\nThere's no stopping you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please, [Player].\nGo ask DATAN how he's doing in his office\nupstairs.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh...\nYou're going to PYRITE TOWN.\nIt's so far off in the desert...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], PROF. KRANE\nentrusted you with this job because he believes\nin you.\nBut please be careful.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, [Player]!\nI heard, I heard!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You've done amazing things!\nYou're putting even grown-ups to shame!\nI might become your fan!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If I'm ever kidnapped, promise me that you'll\ncome save me!\nGiggle![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DATAN's trying to analyze that\nDATA ROM.\nHe's very good at that sort of thing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But then again, I did see him\nyanking out his hair in handfuls.\nThe encryption on that DATA ROM must be\nawfully difficult to crack.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It boggles my mind that you went and rescued\nthe DIRECTOR all by yourself, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't think anyone's capable of beating you\nin a battle anymore in the HQ LAB, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, do you feel like training again today?
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nLet's get on with it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nI'm all set and ready whenever you are.\nCome see me whenever you like.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you want to battle some more?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha!\nThat's the spirit!\nOkay, sure enough.\nLet's get on with it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You went and marched right into the bad guys'\nmidst.\nI bet that made you even tougher in battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd say you got that way because you regularly\ntrain on the BATTLE SIM SYSTEM that I keep\ntuned.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, I know, that's half bragging.\nBut, hey, isn't it also half true?\nAhaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The original DIRECTOR of the POKéMON HQ\nLAB, in other words, your father, [Player],\nI owe a lot to.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He had an outstanding mind.\nNot just that, when it came to battling, there\nwas no one better.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], perhaps you've inherited all\nyour father's good qualities.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player], welcome back!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After what happened, I went and checked up\non the older "SHADOW POKéMON incident."\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Would you like to hear about what I've\ndiscovered so far?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Five years ago, a criminal organization named\nCIPHER used a group called TEAM SNAGEM to\nround up POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER used artificial means to close the\nhearts of the captured POKéMON and turned them\ninto vicious fighting machines.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They were what we call SHADOW POKéMON.\nCIPHER planned to take over the world by arming\ntheir TRAINERS with the SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But their plan was thwarted by a young man\nwho quit TEAM SNAGEM, and by a girl who had a\nspecial ability to identify SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This time, maybe it will be you that stops\nCIPHER, [Player].\nThat would be incredible!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Would you like to hear more?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come see me anytime if you want to hear\nmore about what I've learned.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER's then boss was named EVICE, though\nhe was acting as the mayor of a city under a\ndifferent name.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: EVICE is still safely behind bars, so I don't\nknow how CIPHER managed to come back.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Either a new boss has emerged, or EVICE\nwasn't the big boss.\nIt's got to be one of the two.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's all the information I was able to dig up.\nI hope it helped you, [Player], even if just\na little bit.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player], welcome!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you want to hear about the "SHADOW\nPOKéMON incident" from before?\nI can tell you what I've discovered.
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER's return is disturbing, but I'm glad to\nsee the DIRECTOR back safe and sound.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We all owe you a big thanks, [Player], for\nyour fantastic achievement.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If CIPHER kidnapped PROF. KRANE, did they\nalso attack that missing cargo ship?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm getting more and more worried about the\nPOKéMON that were on that missing ship.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Can you imagine?\nWhat if those cute POKéMON were all turned\ninto SHADOW POKéMON?\nWhat'll we do?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nIsn't DATAN the man who's always fooling\naround with his computer here?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This is strange.\nJOVI wonders where he went.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Big brother, did you meet DATAN?\nThat's good.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nDATAN was playing hide-and-seek?\nNext time, invite JOVI, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's like a dream how the\nDIRECTOR came back unharmed.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: KECLEON came out of the desk,\nI guess to celebrate.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The SNAG MACHINE is a special\ndevice for snagging POKéMON.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?\nDATAN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me think...\nOh, he went downstairs earlier.\nHe had this look of consternation on his face.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your mother was--and is--a doll.\nWhen she was a student, the boys stumbled all\nover each other trying to get her attention.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Two of her classmates both fell hard for her.\nThat would be your father and PROF. KRANE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In the end, your father was the one your\nmother chose.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Behind every person, there's a little bit of\nhistory.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are your POKéMON doing well?\nI've formed a combo with this baby here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I want to make it battle a lot so that it will\nevolve quickly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I knew it!\nTheir hideout was in the southeast!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So they were using that\nabandoned lab on the sly, were they?\nThat's wickedly clever of them.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nThe PURIFY CHAMBER has been completed?!\nYippee!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops!\nIt'd be terrible if CIPHER caught wind of that.\nWe'd better keep this hush-hush.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw DATAN trudging outside the LAB with\na forlorn expression on his face.\nIs there something the matter?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But for now, I'd like you to test\nour SNAG MACHINE.\nAfter all, you're the best TRAINER at this LAB.\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Waah! I'm sorry, PROFESSOR!\nI couldn't decipher it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nOh, it's you, [Player].\nYou scared me half to death!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That DATA ROM is heavily\nprotected like a bank vault.\nIt would take a seriously talented guy to break\nthrough and get at the contents.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A seriously talented guy, you say.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Awaah! PROFESSOR!\nI'm terribly sorry![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha, it can't be helped.\nAnd if it's a seriously talented guy we need,\nwell, I think I may have a solution.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who would that person be?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I'm sorry to spring\nthis on you, but can you deliver the DATA ROM\nto ONBS in PYRITE TOWN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: DATAN, hand the DATA ROM to\n[Player], please.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, right away![dialogue_end]
[Player] received the DATA ROM\nfrom DATAN.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ONBS is known as a TV network,\nbut they're much more than that.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The people that later founded\nONBS were actually instrumental in breaking\nCIPHER's conspiracy five years ago.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please deliver that DATA ROM to\nNETT at ONBS.\nHe's the right-hand man to SECC, ONBS's\nleader.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm confident that he will be\nable to get at the contents of that DATA ROM.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's quite possible that the DATA\nROM contains critical information that CIPHER\nwants to keep secret.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure that NETT at ONBS can\ncheck the contents of that DATA ROM.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: PYRITE TOWN is past AGATE\nVILLAGE.\nIt's a little far, but I need you to do this.\nTake care, though![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm really sorry, [Player].\nIt's my fault that you have to make this trip.\nIf only I managed to analyze it...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm surprised, though.\nNETT is one of the founders of ONBS, which\nis now the biggest information network in all\nthe ORRE REGION.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's amazing that our DIRECTOR\nwould know someone like that.\nHis social circle must be huge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou went off to PYRITE TOWN this time?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That place was known as a town\nof rogues and roughnecks before.\nNow it's famous as ONBS's base of operations.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If it's about the PURIFY CHAMBER, I'm the\none to ask.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you need any information?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard, [Player]!\nYou even went to CIPHER's headquarters?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've decided!\nI'm going to be the [Player] FAN CLUB's\nhonorary lifetime chairperson!\nAnd that's settled![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm checking the compatibility of regular\nPOKéMON and SHADOW POKéMON.\nI'm trying to see what combinations work well.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Depending on the combination, the\neffectiveness of purification may change.\nIf I find a good combination, I'll be sure to let\nyou know, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's quite possible that the DATA\nROM contains critical information that CIPHER\nwants to keep secret.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure that NETT at ONBS can\ncheck the contents of that DATA ROM.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE trusts you a great\ndeal.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Make sure you live up to\nthat trust![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi there, [Player]!\nDid you want to train on the BATTLE SIM\nSYSTEM today?
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nLet's get on with it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nI'm all set and ready whenever you are.\nCome see me whenever you like.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you want to battle some more?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha!\nThat's the spirit!\nOkay, sure enough.\nLet's get on with it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The BATTLE SIM SYSTEM is in peak form.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Battle on it, and get even tougher![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI hasn't come around to play\nyet today.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder what games she'll want\nto play today.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI will go on an adventure just\nlike big brother one day!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Somewhere far, far away!\nSomewhere really fantastic!\nWhere is somewhere like that?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh?\nWhere are PLUPLU and MIMI?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nWelcome back!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, how goes it?\nI doubt that I could beat you again, but how\nabout we have a battle for a change?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nLet's get this happening![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay.\nWell, if you're ever in the mood, let me know.\nI'll be happy to give you a battle.[dialogue_end]
Sound from the TV set appears to be disturbing\nthe POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, that was a wake-up call.\n[Player], there's nothing fake about your\ntoughness.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], so long as you're\naround, world peace is assured![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], your POKéMON appear to be\ngetting stronger and stronger.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's impressive.\nIt means that you're outstanding as a TRAINER,\ntoo, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player]!\nI have a hunch that I can win today!\nWhat say we battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa! I concede defeat!\n[Player], there's nothing fake about your\ntoughness.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], so long as you're\naround, galactic peace is assured![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nI saw you on "POFTY's Fast-Break Report"!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's really cool!\nWe should get out and do more fieldwork, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, [Player]!\nI heard, I heard!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You were on TV, weren't you?\nYou're so high-profile, you're practically a star!\nI might even become your fan!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What am I saying?\nI'm already your fan!\nI'm your number-one fan, I've decided![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nBoy, were we ever surprised to see you suddenly\npop up on television.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We all agreed that you look\ngood on TV.\nEveryone thought you look better than a b-list\ncelebrity.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm studying what combinations of regular\nPOKéMON and SHADOW POKéMON work best for\npurification.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you were to catch many wild POKéMON and\nput them in the PURIFY CHAMBER with the\nSHADOW POKéMON, the pace of purification\nwould really pick up.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Great, you've delivered the\nDATA ROM to NETT.\nThank you and well done!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's hope he can get some\nresults quickly.\nWe'll wait for his contact.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nHi, big brother!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, listen, big brother!\nIs it true that you were on television?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww, that's so neat! Really neat!\nJOVI wishes JOVI could be on TV, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? You're lying!\nEveryone said they saw you.\nJOVI wishes JOVI saw you, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nI saw you on "POFTY's Fast-Break Report"!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rest assured, son!\nI made sure that word got out to everyone!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you looked very cool on TV.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now that POKé SPOTS have been identified,\nyou should be able to go on catching wild\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I bet the PURIFY CHAMBER will be running\nat full capacity soon![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope the DATA ROM's\ndecryption gets finished soon.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It excites me wondering about\nwhat might be on it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], your POKéMON appear to be\ngetting stronger and stronger.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's impressive.\nIt means that you're outstanding as a TRAINER,\ntoo, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I should go to PYRITE TOWN and stroll\naround ONBS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And then maybe one of their talent scouts\nwill try to recruit me!\nThat would be a scream![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're serious?!\nCIPHER appeared in PYRITE TOWN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Man, oh man!\nThey're getting bolder and bolder![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nHow are things?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We haven't got any word back\nfrom NETT yet.[dialogue_end]
[Player] told KRANE what had happened\nat ONBS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?!\nThe DATA ROM contained detailed plans for\nthe capers involving the S.S. LIBRA and PHENAC\nCITY?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And ONBS was attacked by\nCIPHER, too.\nNo wonder we couldn't communicate with them.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, understood.\nPlease, you've got to get to PHENAC CITY as\nsoon as possible.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm counting on you,\n[Player].\nCIPHER's conspiracy can be shattered only by\nyou, [Player], and that SNAG MACHINE![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well?\nDid they manage to get the information out of\nthat DATA ROM?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE is growing very\nworried because NETT hasn't been in contact\nat all.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're going to PHENAC to save\nthe city from CIPHER, aren't you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't want you to do anything\ndangerous, but you're not one to be deterred\nonce you've set your mind to do something.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder...\nDid you get that from your father?\nOr maybe it's me you've gotten that trait from.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine.\nGo on, dear.\nI'm sure that you will be okay![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's no good to lie to me, dear.\nI can tell.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nHi, big brother!\nWelcome home!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, listen!\nDid you catch any wild POKéMON?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow! Awesome!\nThat's why you're JOVI's brother!\nYou're not like ordinary people.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww!\nThat's boring![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You say that RAZELL and DAZELL were in\nPYRITE TOWN?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm glad I didn't rush off to GATEON PORT,\nthen!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how horrid!\nIt really was CIPHER that attacked the S.S.\nLIBRA?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?!\nThe S.S. LIBRA was attacked by CIPHER?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Does that mean all the POKéMON on the\nS.S. LIBRA were turned into SHADOW POKéMON?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no, really?!\nCIPHER is going to attack PHENAC CITY?\nThere's going to be trouble!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You've got to let the people there\nknow before it's too late.\nYou'd better go there right away.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nHow many SHADOW POKéMON have you managed\nto snag?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh...\nYou've only caught that [some_pokemon_4E], and\nthat's it?\nThat's hard to believe!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, you've got the SNAG\nMACHINE.\nI wish you'd use it and snag more SHADOW\nPOKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've caught [unknown_2F]?\nThat's not really enough.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you could snag some more,\nthey'd become useful for battling, and we'd be\nable to save them through purification, too.\nKeep at it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right!\nYou've already snagged [unknown_2F]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I can just imagine how furious\nthose CIPHER goons must be.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is amazing!\nYou've already snagged [unknown_2F] SHADOW\nPOKéMON!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: At the pace you're going, it\nmight not be far off before all the SHADOW\nPOKéMON are saved.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nHi, [Player].\nHow was PHENAC?\nDid you discover anything?[dialogue_end]
[Player] showed the MAYOR'S NOTE\nto PROF. KRANE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is what's happening in\nPHENAC right now?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess there is bad trouble\nafoot.\nOne look at your face tells me that.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But it will be all right.\nYou've become an outstanding POKéMON\nTRAINER in your own right.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do what you think is right.\nIt's your courage that will save the SHADOW\nPOKéMON, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, wowee, really?!\nYou saved PHENAC CITY now?\nThat's just wow!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You keep adding to your incredible\nachievements!\nYour fame keeps growing, too!\nI bet you'll get a fan club![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've heard that you liberated\nPHENAC!\nThat's fantastic work!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This time, we did get word from\nNETT about what happened.\n[Player], you really are out of this world.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, and he was very grateful for\nyour saving MARCIA, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I am concerned about what\nCIPHER was up to in the desert.\nI think that needs to be looked into immediately.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm counting on you,\n[Player].\nCIPHER's conspiracy can be shattered only by\nyou, [Player], and that SNAG MACHINE![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player].\nIt sounds like you're doing tremendous things.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're at an age where I think\nyou'd still like to be pampered, but you're doing\nso much for the good of others.\nThank you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Your courage will save the\nSHADOW POKéMON.\nI'm proud of you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whaat?!\nYou've liberated PHENAC CITY from the clutches\nof CIPHER?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nRest assured that I will get this word out to\neveryone!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There seems to be no telling what CIPHER's\nminions will do.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I'm glad that you're with us.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow!\nSo you're saying CIPHER's members came close\nto replacing all the citizens of PHENAC?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But you sent them all packing.\nThat blows my mind, [Player]![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], lad, you're quite the marvel,\ndriving off CIPHER by yourself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I can see you becoming\na bigger public figure than your distinguished\nfather.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Big brother, you made the bad\npeople go away in that city!\nAwesome!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's JOVI's big brother!\nKeep going and get the rest of the SHADOW\nPOKéMON, big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], your heroic\ndeeds seem to be making LILY and PROF. KRANE\nvery pleased.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, this is about you,\n[Player]!\nI've known you since you were a tiny baby.\nIt also makes me happy to see you this way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The taking of the S.S. LIBRA, then that\nplot to take over PHENAC...\nCIPHER is certainly bold and barbaric.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Who knows, they might try doing something\neven bigger next.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]!\nAre you catching wild POKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to get out and do fieldwork, too...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nI heard, I heard!\nYou're becoming more incredible!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Someone will make a fan club, for sure!\nActually, I'll do it!\nI'm the first fan-club chairperson![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There was a news report on your\nliberation of PHENAC CITY.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You got lots of TV screen time!\nBut then, you were the central figure in that\ntakeover drama, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing you on the news, I got\nnervous and excited as if it were me on-screen.\nAhaha.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Seeing that news report should\nmake people realize how dangerous CIPHER\nreally is.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Because of your brave work,\nCIPHER's conspiracy is gradually becoming\nevident.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player].\nCould you bring me up to speed about the\nPOKéMON you've purified?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Purification has been completed\non just [unknown_2F] SHADOW POKéMON...\nWe still have a long way to go.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rather than just snagging\nSHADOW POKéMON, you should also consider\npurifying them a little more.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Purification has been completed\non [unknown_2F] SHADOW POKéMON...\nThat's a good pace.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You seem to have completely\nmastered the operation of the PURIFY CHAMBER.\nI'm glad that you did.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow.\nUp to now, purification has been completed on\n[unknown_2F] SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's quite a number.\nYou may be able to restore all the SHADOW\nPOKéMON back to their natural states.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Big brother, you were on TV\nagain, weren't you?\nThis time, JOVI saw you, too!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You were cool!\nJOVI wishes JOVI was on TV like that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi!\nI saw you on TV!\nAre you ready for national news?\nHohoho![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player]!\nI saw it, yup, I really did!\nI saw the news about PHENAC's liberation!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I made sure that everyone knows about that!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Everyone's been in an uproar\never since that news broadcast.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now the entire ORRE REGION\nknows how tough you are, [Player]![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nThere's a ship in the desert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, don't be silly!\nThe sea is the only place for a ship!\nEven I know that.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?\nThe S.S. LIBRA is in the middle of the desert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I see...\nSo CIPHER was after the many POKéMON that\nwere aboard that giant cargo ship.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not like the time before when\nthey used TEAM SNAGEM to get POKéMON\na little at a time.\nThis time, they're brazen about what they do.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Could this mean...\nThat they've discovered a way to create many\nSHADOW POKéMON at the same time?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome home, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...I see.\nYou've found the missing S.S. LIBRA.\nThere were many POKéMON on that ship, weren't\nthere?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], only you can save\nthose POKéMON.\nKeep your faith and keep going.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, [Player], welcome back.\nYou're quite the hero.\nEveryone says so about you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But you be sure to show your face to LILY\nevery so often.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Though she won't say it to you, she is\na mother.\nOf course she's worried about you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome back, big brother!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're too busy to play with JOVI\nvery much, but JOVI isn't feeling lonely!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI is busy because JOVI has\nmany people to play with, like ADON and CHOBIN!\nDon't worry about JOVI, big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We played house today, JOVI\nand I.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI played the daddy part, and\nI was the mommy.\nIt was a fun time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], why don't you join\nus the next time as the baby?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! [Player]!\nWhen are you going to be on TV next?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll be sure to get the word out to everyone,\nso let me know in advance!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: No, really?!\nThe S.S. LIBRA was out in the desert?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: How did anyone manage to carry that huge\nship out there?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're saying you found the S.S. LIBRA?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Speaking of which, I wonder what happened\nto that rare and new kind of POKéMON that was\naboard that ship?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, man!\nThe S.S. LIBRA was out in the desert?\nBut why out there of all places?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nMaybe CIPHER experienced trouble they didn't\nforesee?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player], welcome back!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\n[Player], is there something different about\nyou?\nOr am I just imagining it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's going on, [Player]?\nWhy did you take the SNAG MACHINE off?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What, what, whaat?!\nTEAM SNAGEM stole it?\nThat's really bad news!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd heard that TEAM SNAGEM\nhad to close up shop because they lost their\nSNAG MACHINE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But with [Player]'s SNAG\nMACHINE, they might get up to no-good again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER and TEAM SNAGEM...\nIt could be disastrous if they decide to join\nforces again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player]...\nWhoa!\nWhat happened to the SNAG MACHINE?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nTEAM SNAGEM stole it?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Pardon?\nTEAM SNAGEM appeared?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought they'd disappeared\nwith CIPHER years ago.\nThey've become active again?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Without the SNAG MACHINE, you\nwon't be able to save SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It will probably be hard, but you\nmust get it back somehow.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hi, big brother!\nWelcome back!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh-oh?\nWhat happened to the SNAG MACHINE?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI is so used to seeing you\nwith it, it's kind of weird when it's not there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're kidding!\nTEAM SNAGEM reappeared, too?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come to think of it, TEAM\nSNAGEM's boss, GONZAP, was never arrested.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's bad enough with CIPHER\nalready, but things could get even more ugly.\nIt's not a pretty picture![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER must have targeted the\nS.S. LIBRA because they wanted to get at many\nPOKéMON in one fell swoop.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's unfortunate, but we have to\nassume that the POKéMON on board have been\nturned into SHADOW POKéMON at CIPHER's\nhands.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nYou've got to work quickly!\nYou've got to save the SHADOW POKéMON using\nour PURIFY CHAMBER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player]!\nI've got a feeling that I can win today!\nHow about we have a battle?
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nLet's tie one on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It goes without saying, but if the\nSNAG MACHINE is used for criminal purposes,\nit could cause utter chaos.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: An instrument for justice can\neasily become a weapon if it's not used properly.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I feel completely relieved to\nsee that you have it again, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER has to be cornered and\nput down for good now.\nI'm counting on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa! I concede defeat!\n[Player], there's truly nothing fake about\nyour toughness.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], so long as you're\naround, peace is assured, even in the future![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! [Player]!\nYou've recovered the SNAG MACHINE!\nAm I glad to see that!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now you can go back to\nrecovering SHADOW POKéMON from the\nbad guys![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey!\nThe SNAG MACHINE!\nYou've done it!\nYou got it back!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew, that's a relief.\nI was worried that criminals would use the SNAG\nMACHINE for nefarious purposes...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I feel completely relieved to\nsee that you have it again, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER has to be cornered and\nput down for good now.\nI'm counting on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If that SNAG MACHINE didn't\ncome back, I was considering building another\none.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, it's easy enough to\nsay, but it's not so easy to actually make one.\nAhaha.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, CIPHER has to be cornered\nand put down for good.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no, really?\nThe SNAG MACHINE was stolen, but you went\nand recovered it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, you shocked me, but that's\na relief to hear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It goes without saying, but if the\nSNAG MACHINE is used for criminal purposes,\nit could cause utter chaos.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: An instrument for justice can\neasily become a weapon if it's not used properly.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I feel completely relieved to\nsee that you have it again, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER has to be cornered and\nput down for good now.\nI'm counting on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You got your SNAG MACHINE\nback.\nAnd you did it all by yourself without anyone's\nhelp.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm convinced that you can\nrescue all the SHADOW POKéMON without fail,\ndear.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome home, big brother!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nYou have the SNAG MACHINE on!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That looks the best on you, big\nbrother!\nIt's cool!\nJOVI wants one, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right?!\nThat's astounding, getting the SNAG MACHINE\nback from GONZAP.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], it makes me wonder\nhow much tougher you can become.\nIs there no stopping you?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Pardon me?!\nYou've ruined CIPHER's secret factory?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That means...\nNo more SHADOW POKéMON will be created from\nnow on!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's brilliant news!\nYou've really done it, [Player]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But there still remains the job of\nsnagging the SHADOW POKéMON left and\npurifying them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess the time has come for me\nto give you that certain something...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], on your next visit to\nthe LAB, could you meet me on the ground\nfloor?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's something that I want to\ngive you.\nDon't forget.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER's GRAND MASTER\nGREEVIL has challenged you to get him on\nCITADARK ISLE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It appears that our battle against\nCIPHER is headed for the final showdown.\nIt's not hard to imagine things becoming even\ntougher for you, dear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, [Player], I know that you\nwill win against the criminals.\nI believe in you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome back, big brother!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're too busy to play with JOVI\nvery much, but JOVI isn't feeling lonely!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI is busy because JOVI has\nmany people to play with, like ADON and CHOBIN!\nDon't worry about JOVI, big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We played pretend POKéMON\nbattles today, JOVI and I.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI played the TRAINER part,\nand I was the POKé BALL.\nIt was a fun time![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! [Player]!\nWhen are you going to be on TV next?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll be sure to get the word out to everyone,\nso let me know in advance!\nWahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When it's sunny, SOLARBEAM~♪\nWhen it's rainy, HYDRO PUMP~♪\nPOKé POKé POKéMON are so cute~♪\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Isn't that a nice song?\nThey've been playing it a lot on TV lately.\nIt's simple, so I learned it right away.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder what that rare POKéMON on the\nS.S. LIBRA looked like?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I keep obsessing over that.\nI can't concentrate on work at all![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou wrecked a SHADOW POKéMON factory?\nThat is so wicked!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmhm, I see...\nSo CIPHER's boss is on an island?\nCITADARK?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nI hate to admit it, but I don't know where that\nCITADARK ISLE is located.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nI'm glad to see you back.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's something I want to give\nyou, [Player].\nCould you come here, please?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The battle against CIPHER\nappears to have entered a decisive phase.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think the situation calls for a\nspecial solution.\n[Player], there's something here that I'd like\nyou to use.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hold on, [Player]!\nWhere are you going?[dialogue_end]
[Player] obtained a MASTER BALL![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's a MASTER BALL.\nIt's the one POKé BALL that is foolproof.\nIt has a 100% capture ratio.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should only use it if you're\nsure that is the right thing to do.\nKeep at it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa!\nAm I surprised!\nIt shocks me that there's a basement room\nin a place like this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PROF. KRANE is downstairs, dear.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my!\nPROF. KRANE gave you a MASTER BALL?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nYou're taking CIPHER on in their headquarters?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That stuns me.\n[Player], you have superhuman toughness.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But they will be desperate, too.\nDon't let down your guard![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you're finally going\noff to the ultimate battle, aren't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You've really grown in stature.\nAs your mother, it makes me feel conflicted.\nI'm happy and proud on one hand, but I'm also\na little sad.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Go and get rid of CIPHER, and\nmake it quick!\nAnd come home safely.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You what?!\nYou went to CITADARK ISLE?!\nI'm amazed you managed to locate it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That SHADOW POKéMON, XD001,\nis on that island, isn't it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no telling how tough that\nSHADOW POKéMON might be.\nBe cautious when you meet it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd hate to think so, but if they\nuse that SNAG MACHINE for criminal purposes,\nthere's going to be chaos!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: An instrument for justice can\neasily become a weapon if it's not used properly.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nYou've got to get the SNAG MACHINE back!\nThat can't be allowed to fall into the hands of\ncriminals![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha, did that startle you?\nNow, come with me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: LILY, thank you!\nThank you for pulling everyone together so\ncapably in my absence!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nLet's not waste any time!\nLet's all go have a look at the PURIFY\nCHAMBER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Step on the circular plate.\nYou'll get a holographic image of POKéMON in\nthe purification process.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To place POKéMON on the\nvarious SETS, use the control panel.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: While I was gone, everyone\nseems to have rallied around LILY and made\nthings happen.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Go get 'em, big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, [Player], we'll have\nyou lead the way.\nThe glorious history of the PURIFY CHAMBER\nwill begin with you!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], could you go\nupstairs and ask DATAN how he's doing?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm really sorry, [Player].\nIt's my fault that you had to make this trip.\nIf only I managed to analyze it...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm surprised, though.\nNETT is one of the founders of ONBS, which\nis now the biggest information network in all\nthe ORRE REGION.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's amazing that our DIRECTOR\nwould know someone like that.\nHis social circle must be huge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, [Player].\nThat MASTER BALL is extremely precious.\nThink long and hard before you use it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But once you decide to use it,\nthen do so without hesitation.\nIt won't do to let opportunity slip away.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The SNAG MACHINE is inside\nthis case.\nTry equipping it right away, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DATAN is the man in the room\nnext to the DIRECTOR's office.\nRemember?\nHe was compiling the basic data.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hahaha.\nYou don't need to be that stiffly official, LILY.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish everyone wouldn't drown\nthem with such gushing praise all the time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My son and daughter will become\nspoiled rotten.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's nothing to worry about.\nBoth [Player] and JOVI are wonderful kids.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I hate to bother you,\nbut could you go find JOVI for me?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I think you already\nknow, but several research projects are in their\ncritical phases in this LAB.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why your mother can't afford\nto take any time off right this instant.\nSo please, honey, will you go find JOVI for me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\nI'm counting on you.\nI don't think she could have wandered off too\nfar, but just in case, check outside, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, don't be so rebellious.\nPlease, will you go find JOVI?
[bubble_or_speaker]: DR. KAMINKO's manor?\nIt's a little to the south from here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come to think, JOVI was asking persistently\na few days ago about where DR. KAMINKO lives.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But would she go off to a place like that on\nher own?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: You're looking for JOVI?\nWe're supposed to be playing hide-and-seek\nright now, but isn't she around anywhere?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, maybe she's gone off to\nDR. KAMINKO's manor.\nIt's the odd-looking place southeast from here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI's "it" in our game of\nhide-and-seek.\nI wish she'd find me soon.\nMy back is starting to ache.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, JOVI!\nHaven't I told you not to wander away by\nyourself?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Right, big brother?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my, my!\nJOVI, you are such a brave and resourceful girl!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that's quite enough for today.\nBesides, ADON must be tired of waiting for you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my gosh!\nI was in the middle of hide-and-seek!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, big brother, I'll see you later!\nBye-bye![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], thanks for finding\nJOVI for me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nPROF. KRANE wanted to see you, [Player].\nGo see him right away, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The two of us, AIDAN and I, were\ndeveloping it.\nAnd now, it's finally finished.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd like to begin testing it\nimmediately.\n[Player], will you help us?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay.\nStep inside, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you can't say that.\n[Player], you're an excellent battler.\nI think you'd be perfect for the job.
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're off to GATEON PORT with JOVI?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: GATEON PORT, like the name says, is a port\ntown.\nIt's due south of the LAB.\nTake care on your trip.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This basic data should be fine\nnow.\nKeep going with it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you came at the\nright time.\nMay I get you to run an errand for me in\nGATEON PORT?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI knows the PARTS SHOP!\nIt's next door to EMILI's house!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Mommy, can JOVI go?\nJOVI wants to help everyone![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI, I appreciate your offer.\nI know you want to help.\nBut, it's an important component...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Okay.\nJOVI, you're a member of the LAB's staff, too.\nYou may go if you take [Player] with you.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Dear, would you mind going with\nJOVI?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, Mommy!\nBig brother is JOVI's assistant!\nYou have to listen to JOVI, big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Off we go to GATEON PORT![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], JOVI, both of you\nbe very careful, please.\nI'm counting on you two![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've ordered the MACHINE PART\nfrom the PARTS SHOP in GATEON PORT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], JOVI, be very\ncareful, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome back, [Player].\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: We ran the errand like you\nwanted, Mommy.\nA bad guy tried to stop us, but a nice person\nhelped us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no!\nReally?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\nWith this component, we can get down to the\nfinishing touches on the PURIFY CHAMBER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I should take this down to the\nPURIFY CHAMBER on the ground floor now...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nJOVI will take it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI, are you sure?\nDon't drop it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI can do it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], how is your\nSHADOW POKéMON doing?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Purification progresses if a\nSHADOW POKéMON spends time together with\nits TRAINER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Has the HEART GAUGE fallen\nto zero?
[bubble_or_speaker]: It has?\nWell, then it can't wait for the PURIFY CHAMBER\nto be finished, can it?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh.\nBut by the time the PURIFY CHAMBER is\ncompleted, the HEART GAUGE should be down\nto zero.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: If the HEART GAUGE has fallen\nto zero, that SHADOW POKéMON is ready to\nopen its heart.\nBut that alone isn't enough.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To complete the process, the\nPOKéMON needs to go through a purification\nceremony. It's basically a ritual for it to return \nto its natural state.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If the PURIFY CHAMBER were\nready, it could go through the ceremony there,\nbut...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It looks like we'll need a little\nmore time to get finished.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Because of that, I think your\nSHADOW POKéMON should go through the\npurification ceremony using a different process.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There is a village called AGATE.\nIn the village is the RELIC STONE which has\nthe power to restore SHADOW POKéMON to their\nnatural state.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It worries me a lot to send you\nto such a far-off place by yourself, dear.\nBut I also think it's something that only you\ncan do.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, dear?\nWill you go to AGATE VILLAGE?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\nYou know, [Player], I'm so proud of how\nyou're becoming more and more dependable.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're right.\nI don't want you getting into any dangerous\nsituations, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We should wait until the PURIFY\nCHAMBER is finished.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you want your SHADOW\nPOKéMON to go through a purification ceremony\nright away, you must go to AGATE VILLAGE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To be honest, I don't want you\ngoing off there by yourself, especially after\nhearing that someone tried to stop you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Still, I think you can do it,\n[Player].\nWould you like to go?
[bubble_or_speaker]: AGATE VILLAGE is southeast\nof here.\nIt may take you a while.\nWhen you get there, go speak with EAGUN.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I will do my best to get the PURIFY\nCHAMBER finished while you're gone.\nPlease be careful, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player].\nCould you wait just one second?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: They'll give you basic information\nabout SHADOW POKéMON.\nI'd like you to read them over at least once.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI is on an important trip\nto GATEON PORT.\nBig brother is JOVI's assistant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\n[Player] is your assistant?!\nUh... You must be confident with such a good\nassistant, JOVI.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Anyways, [Player], could\nwe ask you to hold on to that SNAG MACHINE\nand use it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There may be other SHADOW\nPOKéMON out there.\nIf you spot one, rescue it from the criminals.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll make approaches to the\nauthorities and other people to have POKé BALLS\navailable for sale at shops.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The SNAG MACHINE is actually a\nvery dangerous machine if it's not used properly.\nBy all rights, it should actually be kept under\nsecure storage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But having said that, after what\nhappened here, it may be safer if you kept it,\n[Player], rather than keeping it here.\nWe're relying on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CIPHER must have overrun\nPHENAC CITY by now...\nPromise me that you'll be extremely cautious.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm counting on you,\n[Player].\nCIPHER's conspiracy can be shattered only by\nyou, [Player], and that SNAG MACHINE![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's it for purification.\nThere are no more SHADOW POKéMON left.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You've done it, [Player].\nThank you for your valiant effort, dear![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We've ordered a special MACHINE\nPART for the PURIFY CHAMBER from the\nPARTS SHOP.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Was JOVI well behaved?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...I'll get the details later.\nWhat about the MACHINE PART?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The RELIC STONE, which is\nused for the purification ceremony, is under the\ncare of a man named EAGUN.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I will get in touch with him so\nthat he knows you're coming, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I will do my best to get the\nPURIFY CHAMBER finished while you're gone.\nPlease be careful, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I found some more MEMOS\nI wrote up with the DIRECTOR.\nI think you should have them, [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm really sorry, [Player].\nIt's my fault that you had to make this trip.\nIf only I managed to analyze it...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm surprised, though.\nNETT is one of the founders of ONBS, which\nis now the biggest information network in all\nthe ORRE REGION.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's amazing that our DIRECTOR\nwould know someone like that.\nHis social circle must be huge.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm trying to analyze the DATA ROM that\nPROF. KRANE trusted me with.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But its contents are heavily guarded by\nserious protection.\nI can't put a dent in it.\nWhat am I to do...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Certainly.\nOkay, [Player], listen closely.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PURIFY CHAMBER status is on standby.\nSystem status is good to go!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Step onto that circular plate.\nA holographic image of the POKéMON involved\nin purification will appear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, it would if there were actually some\nPOKéMON on the SETS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When you're checking the hologram, you can\nzoom to individual SETS.\nAt any selected SET, you can configure things\nas you see fit.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A control panel will appear for you to pick the\nPOKéMON you want to place on the selected SET,\nposition them, and so on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you bring some POKéMON, [Player], you\ncan place them on SETS.\nDon't worry, you'll figure it out when you\nactually try it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll also be around to provide advice if you\nneed it.\nFirst, check the hologram, please.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nWelcome back.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], there's something\nthat I'd like you to have.\nCould you come with me downstairs?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, right!\nI heard that you were on TV on a news report\nabout POKé SPOTS.\nWay to go!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd heard that wild POKéMON were\nappearing in the ORRE REGION.\nSo, yes, it's fantastic news, indeed.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nYou've snagged the DRAGONITE, which we\nbelieve to be the last SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That means you've rescued all\nthe SHADOW POKéMON that CIPHER created.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thanks for your great effort!\n[Player], I'm glad I was able to help in my\nown way.[dialogue_end]
JOVI joined the party.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bring me back something nice![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let JOVI come with you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nYou were great to destroy CIPHER's secret\nfactory.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's unlikely that more SHADOW\nPOKéMON will be created from now on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But there still remains the job of\nsnagging the SHADOW POKéMON left and\npurifying them.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, [Player].\nWould you like to hear about my findings?\nThey're on SHADOW moves.
[Player] found a P★DA![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], I think you've noticed by now,\nbut when there are four regular POKéMON\nsurrounding the SHADOW POKéMON, their type\nmatchups affect purification.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If all four regular POKéMON are of\nadvantageous types, the SET's purification\ntempo is boosted to the top speed.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Just think of the type as being "super\neffective" against the SHADOW POKéMON.\nWhen the SET's top speed is reached, I call it\na "Best Circle."\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's not all.\nIf more than one SET reaches the Best Circle\nstatus, there appears to be an added bonus.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The purification speed surpasses calculated\nscores.\nIt may be because the Best Circle SETS\nharmonize.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If that's the case, I wonder what will happen if\nall the SETS reach the Best Circle status?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, big brother!\nLook, look!\nIt's the sea! The sea!\nIt's so big![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, listen!\nThe PARTS SHOP is over there!\nHurry, big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ouchies!\nJOVI fell down![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, now!\nWhere do you think you're going?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, sorry!\nJOVI is sorry!\nIt wasn't on purpose![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've messed up the happening\nlook of ZOOK, the coolest, baddest, and most\nhappening guy around!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou there, yeah, you, punk.\nYou're with this munchkin, aren't you?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've done it now!\nDon't think you're getting away with messing\nwith the great [bubble_or_speaker]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Remember this![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Should I give chase?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: No, no.\nThat won't be necessary.\nHe won't come back.\nLeave him be.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, sir.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let us be on our way.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh...\nThank you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hohoho.\nThat hardly deserves such gratitude, my little\nlady.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nEMILI and ACRI![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: So it was you, JOVI, being\nharassed by that big, strange man.\nWere you okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yup, strong people helped us.\nBig brother was there, too, so nothing bad\nhappened.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI came here on an important\nvisit.\nBig brother is JOVI's assistant today![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you must be JOVI's brother\n[Player].\nI'm glad we finally met![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That luxury CRUISER moored behind the\nPARTS SHOP belongs to MR. VERICH.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoops, hold it, kid.\nSorry, but I can't let you go here.\nThe pier's closed so they can move that huge\nCRUISER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, sorry, but the pier can't be moved right\nnow.\nThe CRUISER's going to be leaving port soon.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, does that interest you?\nMR. VERICH gave it to me, saying he doesn't\nneed it anymore.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, you see, I don't battle.\nYou're welcome to take that, if you'd like.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sure, there are many hotheads around\nthese parts, but picking on kids like you\nis going too far.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But the guy that ran off...\nI don't remember seeing him around.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That old man is MR. VERICH.\nHe's supposed to be really wealthy!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The people with him were really strong, too!\nWow, were they ever cool![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That battle was awesome.\nBoth sides had wicked POKéMON.\nIt was wild!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh...\nI forgot what I'm supposed to get on my\nerrand...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You know already, don't you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, of course you would.\nYou're a POKéMON TRAINER. You should know.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right!\nThen, I'd better tell you.\nYou should know, though.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: This building is the POKéMON CENTER.\nThis is where you can get your POKéMON\nrestored to full health.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The building next door to that is the\nPOKéMON MART.\nThey sell all sorts of useful items.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Learning to use these two facilities properly\nmakes you a qualified TRAINER.\nIt's basic![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There hasn't been much for sailors lately.\nThey've taken to whiling their time away at the\nKRABBY CLUB.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They're all burly lunks, though.\nThey're not the sort that a cultured type like me\ncan associate with.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish those lugs would go back out to sea\nalready.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When the shipping traffic's down this much,\nthere's not much we sailing men can do except\nsit around and mope.\nIsn't that right, matey![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd say so, matey.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When everyone's scared witless of going out\nto sea, there's some guy leaving port on some\nsuperluxury CRUISER!\nThat's a surprise, matey![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It'd take someone really rich, and I don't\nmean just rich, but like stinking rich, to have\na CRUISER that gorgeous.\nDo you agree, matey?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nWhen someone's talking, you should be paying\nattention.\nIsn't that right, matey?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gaaaah![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now look here, boy. The\nKRABBY CLUB is open only to tough TRAINERS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I suppose I could let you in if\nyou can beat me in a battle.\nLet's go for it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're quite strong, I must admit.\nI sense a fantastic potential in you as a TRAINER\nof POKéMON.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The more you battle, the\nstronger your POKéMON shall grow.\nIt is up to you to put in the effort.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Also...\nThere is no rule forbidding anyone but tough\nTRAINERS from entering the KRABBY CLUB.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We have so much idle time on our\nhands, I decided to play a little prank on you!\nHahahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aye, welcome, youngster!\nNo words need be spoken, no questions need\nbe asked!\nWe shall battle, yes?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aye, good answer!\nA battle with a feisty lad is one to be savored!\nLet's go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nNo, you say?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, that's too bad.\nBut I'm a man, and quite reasonable at that.\nI'll forego this, then, aye.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Uh... Welcome!\nUh... Welcome to my POKéMON MART, and, uh...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Um... What was I supposed to say?\nOh, it doesn't matter!\nI've finally become the owner of a POKéMON\nMART!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nToo bad!\nI guess I lost that one!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I used a tough POKéMON that\nI got as a gift, but you one-upped me, lad.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What I'd like to do is get a lot\nmore tough.\nSo, a battle is welcome anytime!\nI'm up for your challenge whenever you like![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This here boat happens to be the personal\nproperty of MR. VERICH, the world's wealthiest\ntycoon.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I'm on guard duty, nothing gets by me,\nnot even a RATTATA![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The sea is wide, and it's fathoms \ndeep~♪\nSo full of POKéMON, it'll make you weep~♪\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? What's up, kid?\nWere you captivated by my singing?\nI'll have you know I placed second at the\nKRABBY CLUB's music contest!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-huh!\nI bet you did, I bet you did, indeed!\nYou know how to bring a smile to my face!\nMufufufu![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you weren't?\nThen, let me guess, you came for a POKéMON\nbattle, right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you can beat me,\nyou'll get something good![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh, no!\nWhat am I saying?\nI'm so sorry![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome!\nWe've added to our fine selection of\nmerchandise to meet all your needs in\ntoday's wild POKéMON boom!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, who would've thought it!\nMe, lose to a kid like you!\nNow, if this were singing, I'd have you beat!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I promised!\nI'll give you this, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, let's all sing for the\nWINGULL sailor~♪\nFor let it be known it's a mighty sailor~♪\nOh, there was a small WAILMER~...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, kid!\nI surely lost that battle, but I have the music\nin me~♪[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When a ship leaves the harbor,\nthey make the bridge rotate to open the way.\nThe bridge's operated using a button in the\nmiddle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The ROTATING BRIDGES appear to be out of\ncommission, though.\nYou won't be able to get across to the other\nside right now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I feel so privileged!\nI got to see MR. VERICH again today!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That cute face!\nHis adorable build!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nI feel faint, he bedazzles me so![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If POKéMON need to rest, nothing can better\nthe POKéMON CENTER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why, even seniors like me visit here to rest\non occasion![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're lucky to have POKéMON CENTERS.\nI mean, it's free!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't matter how many POKéMON you\nhave--a POKéMON CENTER restores them all for\nfree!\nIsn't that great?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's a PC for anyone to use at every\nPOKéMON CENTER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're free to use it, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I became a TRAINER at this age, so I've\nbeen coming here daily to learn more about what\ntraining involves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, wow, I see that you're already raising\nPOKéMON at your age.\nI consider that impressive.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nI'll do my best to keep up with you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been up on dry land for so long now, I'm\nlosing the feel for life on the sea.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've assembled all my supplies, and my\nPOKéMON are restored to full health.\nBut who knows when the next ship will sail?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: POTION, POTION...\nWe seafaring men know to stock up on POTIONS\nwhen in port!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Unlike dry land, there's not a POKéMON\nCENTER to be seen on the open sea.\nSo, you never want to be caught short on\nPOTIONS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I know!\nHere, let me give you a POTION.\nIt's convenient, I tell you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Even on dry land, in certain situations, that\nPOTION will be more trusty than a POKéMON\nCENTER![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: POTION, POTION...\nWe seafaring men know to stock up on POTIONS\nwhen in port!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Unlike dry land, there's not a POKéMON\nCENTER to be seen on the open sea.\nSo, you never want to be caught short on\nPOTIONS![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There are so many items, it's utterly\nbewildering.\nWhat should I get, I wonder?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, I'm buying a whole lot here.\nHow about throwing in a little bonus?\nHow about it?\nCome on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For a poisoning, use an ANTIDOTE.\nPARLYZ HEAL cures paralysis.\nAnd AWAKENING wakes up a sleeping POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes, if a POKéMON falls asleep in\na battle, you can rouse it by calling it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Usually, if no ships come to the harbor, my\nbusiness dries up.\nBut thanks to MR. VERICH, business is booming!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Every day, the man treats everyone to free\nmeals and drinks.\nThat MR. VERICH is like a bottomless sack of\nmoney![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gahahaha!\nEat! Eat up! Then eat some more!\nEat to the last drop of strength!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Who knows who the guy is, but let's hear it\nfor MR. VERICH!\nHip, hip, hooray![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeahah!\nMR. VERICH's footing the tab again today!\nYeah, yeah, yeah!\nI'm going to gorge myself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I slept in and missed my ship.\nIt turns out the ship I was supposed to be on is\nthat cargo ship that went missing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It made me sit up and notice how fate can\nturn on the littlest thing.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A while ago, I saw this obviously wealthy old\ngent and his sidekicks go upstairs to the VIP\nsection.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It seems the old guy's the talk of the town\nthese days.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, let's hear it!\nRAZELL!\nDAZELL!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa, hold up.\nYou're too young to appreciate these seats\nup close, lad![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're working now.\nIf you want an autograph, make it later.\nTralalala~♪[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tralilala~♪\nMy dancing is entrancing![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nOh, the kids from earlier.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH tends to his many important\nbusiness undertakings from GATEON PORT.\nWe do a lot of traveling from here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When we get some rare time off, we like to\nrelax and unwind leisurely.\nI'll ask that you keep it quiet and refrain from\ndisturbing us.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That elderly gentleman with the entourage in\nthe back?\nThat would be MR. VERICH, and he must be quite\nthe VIP, probably.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He's been letting everyone in town feast on\nhis money just because he'll be staying here for\na while.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Harrumph!\nWe're the veteran act of the KRABBY CLUB.\nWe've been here the longest!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our POKéMON-twosome act remains the\nworld's best for all time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We certainly won't be upstaged by upstarts\nlike the MAGICIANS on stage now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: My KRABBY couple KRABILLY and\nKRABETTY are energized for a great show!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Isn't that right? Eh?\nKRABILLY! KRABETTY![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kurrrabii...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kurabi.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you wish to see our act, then let it be on\nthe stage.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mutter...\nI'm making my debut today...\nI'm so nervous...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't relish the thought of going on stage\nafter the MAGICIANS.\nThey're the top act here, after all.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The KRABBY couple are sure calm, though.\nThey're stage veterans, and it shows.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PARTS SHOP is full of weird things and\nnifty junk.\nIt's exciting to rummage around here!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I come looking for PC parts and parts for\ntoys all the time.\nI'm a regular here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There we go!\nThat works!\nWatch me make this shop the best in all of\nthe ORRE REGION!\c
[unknown2_07_1]USAGE
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh, no!\nI'm so sorry!\nUh... POKé BALLS and POKé SNACKS!\nThe perfect companions for TRAINERS![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Greetings!\nWe've added new merchandise that's perfect for\noutstanding TRAINERS!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Finally, my merchandise selection is the best\nin all ORRE!\nBut my dream doesn't end here!\nI want the best shop in the world!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no!\nI beg your pardon!\nUh... MAX POTION, and uh... FULL RESTORE!\nWould you like some?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The shopkeeper's not around today.\nThe old man must be at DR. KAMINKO's place\nagain.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a mystery to me why he'd be friends with\nthat odd doctor who's involved in downright-\neccentric research.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh... What should I do...\nMy son says he's going to quit being a sailor,\nand he's adamant about it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ever since he got an ODDISH a while back,\nit's consumed his life.\nFrom morning to night, it's ODDISH this,\nODDISH that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've decided to give up my life on the sea for\nlife on dry land so I can raise this ODDISH.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: One day, I'll make it evolve into \na VILEPLUME.\nOr a BELLOSSOM would be great, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Whichever one I choose, I'll need a special\nitem for the evolution to happen.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oddiish![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wah, [Player]!\nHow did you know I was here?\nOh, wait a second...\c
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm thinking of writing a novel\nwith a character modeled after the much\ntalked-about MR. VERICH.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Who is the mysterious gentleman\nthat suddenly arrived in GATEON PORT?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: At times, a generous tycoon, but\nhis true identity--a swashbuckling thief!\nHow's that for a story premise?\nDoesn't it get your heart racing?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've lived in GATEON PORT for many, many\nyears, but I've never seen a CRUISER that grand\nor luxurious.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That CRUISER looks capable of sailing\nanywhere in the world.\nI would surely love to sail on it...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maggnee! Maggnee![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's an island far from the coast of\nGATEON PORT.\nIt's surrounded by vicious ocean currents,\nhowever, so no one can go near.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, everyone around these parts\nknows better than to go near that island in the\nfirst place.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The shop's old man and DR.\nKAMINKO go back a long ways, or so I hear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's strange that he would be friends with\nthat eccentric doctor and his weird research.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GATEON PORT's sea breeze\nfeels great, as it always does.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: On a day like this, a battle is\nsure to feel fantastic.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: How about it, sweetie?\nWant to have a battle against my POKéMON?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I like your answer.\nLet's see what you're made of.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, all right, that's fine, too.\nCome back if you're in the mood.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought you were just a kid,\nbut you're not half bad!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sure you're going to become\none decent TRAINER down the road.\nLet's battle again sometime.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH's assistants were really strong,\nweren't they?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder which one is stronger?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I made up my mind.\nWhen I grow up, I'm going to be rich like\nMR. VERICH.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I get that rich, I'm going to buy tons\nof toys and snacks with toys inside![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH has gone out again today.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I suppose it's just sightseeing, but I do\nwonder where he goes day in and day out.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Actually, MR. VERICH looks identical to my\nfirst crush.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That cute face!\nHis adorable build!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nOh, MR. VERICH...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It might just be my imagination playing\na trick on me, you know?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that old guy, MR. VERICH, he has this\nsense of menace about him.\nI get shivers when I see that guy.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: To tell the truth, when MR.\nVERICH is here, I turn into a bundle of nerves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: His two associates are somehow very\nmenacing, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, whoops!\nI shouldn't be telling you this!\nPlease don't tell anyone I've been saying things\nlike this![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mutter...\nMy stage debut was a success, but I'm not\nthere as a performer yet.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I need to refine my act some more.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sorry we were out.\nA MACHINE PART, you said, right?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I get it!\n[Player], you came to catch the MAGICIANS\nwithout adult supervision, didn't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Yup, just like me!\nYou look pretty straitlaced, but you know how\nto find your fun![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here it is, here it is.\nThis is it.\nHere you go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a rare item, that MACHINE\nPART.\nIt took a while to get the order in.\nHow's your DIRECTOR, PROF. KRANE, doing?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: RAZELL!\nDAZELL!\nOh, yeah! Tweet!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I won't tell your parents, so don't\nrat me out to my grandpa, okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DR. KAMINKO seems to be in\na bit of a slump right now.\nI've not gone to see him lately.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It won't be long before he starts\ncoming up with his entertaining inventions,\nI'm sure of it.\nI'll just be patient.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Are you feeling okay?\nYour POKéMON are fine, too.\nYou're going to be just fine![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The more you battle, the\nstronger your POKéMON shall grow.\nIt is up to you to put in the effort.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I, I, I!\nWant you! Want you!\nOh yeah! I'm feeling it!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, Boss!\nThe way you gyrate is the greatest!\nShake, shake, shake!\nShake it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What, you again?\nWe're in a state of denial.\nBuzz off and leave us be, all right?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're all happy that the MAGICIANS duo\ncame back to the KRABBY CLUB, but who is that\nweirdo between them?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I envy that guy...\nI mean, look at him!\nFlanked by the MAGICIANS![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who is this person?\nHis infectious dance style makes me want to\ndance harder![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tralilalilalala...\nThis guy's dancing has an edge, too!\nI can't be upstaged in our performance![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Those girls are the top-billed duo of the\nKRABBY CLUB.\nThey call themselves the MAGICIANS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They can sing, they can dance, and they do\na decent magic act, too.\nThey're a triple threat, and we idolize them!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, aye!\nYou're the greatest, MAGICIANS![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm [bubble_or_speaker].\nHi, JOVI's big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, bye-bye, JOVI![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That elderly gentleman's name is\nMR. VERICH.\nHe comes here by boat with his two assistants\noccasionally.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's something mysterious\nabout him, don't you think?\nHe's supposed to be fabulously wealthy.\nRumors like that give me shivers!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm hoping to become a novelist.\nWhenever I come across anything mysterious,\nI try to imagine a story around it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyways, be careful in this town.\nThere are lots of rough customers about.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH and his people left for\nsomewhere on his luxury CRUISER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Does he travel around the world on it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew...\nOh? Now, you're a rare child.\nMost people would take the elevator.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Youngster, are you doing this for exercise?\nHohohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I look down from the top of the\nLIGHTHOUSE, I get frightened as if I'm being\nsucked down.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that sensation of falling...\nIt grows on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You see the island in the distance out at\nsea?\nIt's always obscured by clouds.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If only those clouds weren't there, we would\nget gorgeous sunsets at dusk.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yup.\nSee you, EMILI![dialogue_end]
[Player] obtained the [some_item_2D].[dialogue_end]
Ride the ROBO KYOGRE?
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you'd like, how about you help me while\nsome time away?\nI've got a tale to tell that you may find\ninteresting.
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Sheesh.\nGrandpa still hasn't come home.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Guess he's not worried that his\ndoting grandson could end up on the streets if\nhe doesn't tend to his shop![dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had been happening\nto PERR.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nThe HQ LAB's DIRECTOR was abducted by\nsome goons with SHADOW POKéMON?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been through something like\nthat before, but who would've thought it'd\nhappen again?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nIt's JOVI's big brother!\nHi!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're alone today?\nPlease bring JOVI next time![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The distinguished and enigmatic\ngentleman MR. VERICH who suddenly arrived in\nGATEON...\nWhat is the identity of this mystery man?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello, [Player].\nI'm sorry, I was thinking about my story.\nI didn't notice you at all.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, don't be so closed-minded.\nI'd like you to hear this tale.\nI'm bored out of my wits.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Gnnnnn!\nSorry doesn't begin to cut it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: And it looks to me like you're\na TRAINER.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You look like you'll be a million\ntimes more fun than some munchkin![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's quite enough of that.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH, perhaps I should...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll stomp you flat with my\nSHADOW POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: POKéMON aren't meant to be used in such\na manner.\nChoose your place and time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nAnd who do you think you are?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So now you're going to play\nthe man and stop me?\nThis gets better by the minute!\nLet's see you try![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We did only what had to be\ndone. Nothing more.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou say that you are raising an EEVEE?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What a fortuitous coincidence!\nThis must have been meant to happen!\nWell, let me commemorate this occasion by\ngiving you one of the five items.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no need to be shy about it.\nGo ahead!\nChoose one![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no need to be shy about it.\nGo ahead and choose one.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That [some_item_2D] will make an EEVEE\nevolve into the POKéMON [some_pokemon_4E].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's easy to make your EEVEE evolve with\nthat [some_item_2D].\nAll you have to do is use it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Would you like to have the [some_item_2D]?\n
[bubble_or_speaker]: That [some_item_2D] will make an EEVEE\nevolve into the POKéMON [some_pokemon_4E].\nBut it's not all that simple.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: First, you need to keep that [some_item_2D]\nwith you all the time.\nDon't put it away in the PC, and don't throw\nit out!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You also need to keep your EEVEE\nwith you.\nIf your EEVEE's friendliness is sufficiently high,\nit will evolve when it levels up.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Remember, you have to have that\n[some_item_2D] with you, and your EEVEE has\nto be friendly enough to you when it levels\nup for it to evolve.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, would you like to have the [some_item_2D]?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine.\nYou can have the [some_item_2D].\nJust like your EEVEE, it's invaluable![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you need help from the shop, I think\nsomeone's fixing the ROTATING BRIDGES\noutside.\nWhy not go see him if you're in a hurry?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you see him, can you tell him to get back\nto the shop soon?[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]When [Player] has the [some_item_2D]\nand the [some_pokemon_4E] is sufficiently friendly,\nit will evolve upon leveling up.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, how are you doing?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's have a look at that [some_pokemon_4E]\nyou're with.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It simply adores you!\nIt couldn't possibly get to like you more.\nThis is wonderful![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It seems to like you very much.\nYour [some_pokemon_4E] seems to be very happy that\nit's with you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It likes you quite a bit.\nIt wants to be pampered by you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GATEON PORT's sea breeze feels great, as\nit always does.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sure, there are many hotheads and\nroughnecks here, but it's a good town.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish I could be a TRAINER soon!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I want to be a TRAINER that makes everyone\nstop and go, "Wow!"[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've decided to retire from selling herbal\nmedicine.\nIt's become too hard for me to gather the\ningredients, you see.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not an easy task working one's way\nthrough tall grass, searching among rocks,\nand so on.\nIt's too physically taxing for me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Munch...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, is that all?\nThat was merely putting a fool in his place.\nDon't worry about it.[dialogue_end]
The controls are unresponsive...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I was younger, I sailed all the world's\nseas as a navigator.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our world is huge!\nAnd this huge world is filled with an incredible\nprofusion of POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of all the POKéMON in our world, the one that\nI found to be most interesting is EEVEE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, EEVEE is a unique POKéMON.\nIt can evolve into five different kinds of\nPOKéMON, you see.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: While I sailed, I studied EEVEE quite\nexhaustively.\nAs a result, I obtained five items that are the\nkeys to EEVEE's evolution.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A rookie performer got up on the stage after\nthe MAGICIANS, but he was tense and nervous.\nHe didn't relax during his performance at all.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd say he was completely intimidated by the\npopularity of the MAGICIANS.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you've left your EEVEE in the PC Storage\nSystem, go get it right away.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll share one of the items that makes EEVEE\nevolve as my thanks for your listening to my tale.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI, when can we play again?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Umm...\nBig brother can't run errands by himself without\nJOVI, so JOVI might not be able to play for\na while.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you were raising an EEVEE, but you've\nset it free?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's a heartbreaking thing to do.\nStill, I need to thank you for hearing my tale.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll give you one of the five items that\nan EEVEE needs for evolution.\nWho knows, it may come in handy one day.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no need to be shy about it.\nGo ahead and choose one.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope JOVI's big brother will be\nable to run errands by himself soon.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine.\nYou can have the [some_item_2D].\nI'm sure it will come in handy one day.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope the LAB DIRECTOR's\nfound.\nI'll be rooting for you, so don't give up.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, did you want something here?\nThe shopkeeper's out right now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He said something about having to go out to\nDR. KAMIN...uh...what was it now?\nWell, to that doctor's manor is where he went.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He said his grandson PERR will be back from\nrepairing the ROTATING BRIDGES,\nso I'm supposed to mind the shop until then.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I don't know where anything is or how to\nring up a sale or anything.\nI have no clue what to do!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I suppose it doesn't matter, though.\nIt's really quiet here.\nI'm getting awfully bored, really.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Since I last saw you, I've been\ninvestigating MR. VERICH's background.\nBut the man's too much of a mystery.\nI can't write a novel modeled after him.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's okay to be mysterious, but\nhe's far too murky.\nSigh... I thought I could write an interesting\nnovel this time...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: And look what you've done!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The MAGICIANS duo has left the KRABBY\nCLUB for bigger opportunities.\nI'm still in shock...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I mean, a POKéMON-couple act...\nThat's hardly exciting or uplifting...\nOh, moan...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: RAZELL!\nDAZELL!\nCome back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That KRABBY-couple act hasn't changed in\nthe least bit over the years.\nFrankly, it's worn out and boring.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no sense of progress, never mind\nevolution, as a performance.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Harrumph!\nOur POKéMON-couple performance is at peak\nform, as always![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There we have it, folks!\nMore bubbly foam than usual!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: So, how did you like it?\nI see that our fabulous performance has left you\nspeechless![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The MAGICIANS duo caught the eye of\nsomeone from the TV network.\nThey'll be making their TV debut soon.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm going to work harder and succeed like\nthem![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, here you are.\nOver this way.\nLook toward the pier.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: That is the ROBO KYOGRE!\nDoesn't its blue form thrill you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's all ready to go.\nYou can leave whenever you're ready.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What am I to do?\nWe're due to go up on stage soon, but KRABILLY\nand KRABETTY seem to have lost their voices![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's up?\nDo you need more parts?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had been happening\nto PERR.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that right!\nYou rescued the HQ LAB's DIRECTOR!\nThat's great to hear.\nThat case had me worried.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But you're something else.\nI can't imagine sneaking into CIPHER's lab by\nmy lonesome.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It just goes to show you, you\ncan't judge people by how they look.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You met that DR. KAMINKO\nbefore, didn't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a mystery to me, but he and\nmy grandpa seem to get along famously.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That DR. KAMINKO--all he does\nis make weird inventions.\nBut Grandpa says the man is gifted.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my!\nPROF. KRANE was rescued?\nI'm very glad to hear that.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: EMILI and I saw news about his\nabduction on television.\nIt was quite frightening.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nSomeone rescued PROF. KRANE?\nThat's awesome!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI must be very happy, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The more I investigate MR.\nVERICH, the more blind alleys I run into.\nHe's completely shrouded in secrecy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: With so little to go on, I can't\nwrite a novel modeled on his character.\nI might need to find a different main character.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When can JOVI come again?\nI want to play with her again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo, [Player]!\nI heard from BITT.\nYou want to cross the desert, do you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You want to be able to cross the\ndesert on your SCOOTER, right?\nAll you need is a conversion kit.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But Grandpa's gone out again\nand hasn't come back, just like before...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Grandpa's the only one who\nknows about all the parts we carry...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're amazing!\nWell, I always thought you were amazing,\nbut I didn't know how amazing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Here you are before my eyes,\nbut you're also on the TV news.\nIt's a funny little feeling.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, I've figured it out!\nYou want your SCOOTER modified so you can\nlay a smackdown on CIPHER, right?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Of all times, Grandpa would be\nout of the shop.\nIt's a headache.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He's over at DR. KAMINKO's\nmanor again.\nYou'd be better off going to see him in person.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The show that was on TV just now was wild!\nIt was like an action movie!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? The news?\nI wasn't paying attention to the news.\nEhehe.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? Huh? Huh?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-wasn't that you that was just on the\nnews?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Oh, on closer inspection, I guess\nyou're not.\nThere sure are people that look alike out in\nthe big world![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! JOVI's big brother!\nI saw you on the news!\nIt's awesome!\nI think you're really cool![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw you!\nOn the news earlier!\nIt was very exciting!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A boy TRAINER stands against a\ngiant criminal organization to protect world\npeace!\n...That is so cool!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Rather than MR. VERICH, I think\nI could write a more entertaining novel with you\nas the main character.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Giggle...\nThe TV news earlier really motivated me.\nI'm going to write up a storm![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my, my.\nI haven't seen you for a while.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I understand that you were quite\nthe hero in PHENAC CITY.\nVery impressive of you.\nHohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The CRUISER's setting sail soon.\nNothing gets by me, not even a RATTATA![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew, what a job that was.\nI'm finally done!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've converted it into a hover-type\nSCOOTER, so it will be perfect for the desert!\nGo on, try it out right away![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your SCOOTER's become\nseriously awesome.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It'll be fine in any desert now!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that ROBO KYOGRE we got\nfrom DR. KAMINKO...\nIs it going to be useful, do you think?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I think it's just going to be junk\nlike usual.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PARTS SHOP is full of weird things and\nnifty junk.\nIt's exciting to rummage around here!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I come looking for PC parts and parts for\ntoys all the time.\nI'm a regular here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The shopkeeper and DR.\nKAMINKO apparently go back a long time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a mystery to me why he'd be friends with\nthat odd doctor who's involved in downright\neccentric research.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I reckon it's about time I got\naround to assembling the ROBO KYOGRE that\nKAMINKO gave me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: KAMINKO said it was no good,\nbut, oh no, it's a fine robo POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But only as a vehicle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I finish it, I'll give you\na ride.\nYou be sure to look forward to that.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That ROBO KYOGRE Grandpa\nbrought home from DR. KAMINKO's...\nI wonder if it will be useful?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll bet it's a piece of junk, as per\nusual.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nHow is the HOVER BIKE running?\nAre you finding it useful?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: W-what's that you say?\nThe S.S. LIBRA was out in the desert?\nThe same S.S. LIBRA that vanished?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hoo...\nThe shock of hearing that almost knocked me\noff my feet.\nAre the POKéMON safe?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, yes, mustn't forget!\nI have to tell you about the ROBO KYOGRE I got\nfrom KAMINKO.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It will become a fine robo\nPOKéMON as a vehicle.\nIt's a challenge that I relish.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I finish it, I'll give you\na ride.\nYou be sure to look forward to that.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're kidding!\nThe S.S. LIBRA was found?!\nThat's big news!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, so CIPHER are the culprits?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wherever they go, they're the arch\nenemies of POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player]!\nYou read my E-MAIL?\nI've been waiting for this!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After seeing you on TV, you've\nbeen on my mind, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've come to realize that there's\nnothing to do but write a novel\nstarring you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, please let me interview you.\nLet's begin right away.[dialogue_end]
[Player] agreed to an interview.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...I see, [Player], it was you that saved\nPROF. KRANE, the DIRECTOR of the POKéMON\nHQ LAB?
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you were on TV for\nthe PHENAC news story.\nBut you've been on TV before?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, goodness!\nThe S.S. LIBRA was attacked because CIPHER\nwanted to get at the POKéMON on board?
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Wow! That's beyond incredible!\n[Player], you must be an amazingly talented\nTRAINER despite your appearance!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Just interviewing you has excited\nme to the edge of my seat!\nYour tale is so thrilling, harrowing, and\nexhilarating!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I owe you a huge thanks for\nagreeing to this interview.\nThank you so much![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm getting the feeling that I can\nwrite an epic masterpiece, and it's all owed\nto you!\nWatch me write it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Interviewing you made me finally\nrealize what was missing from my writing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Reality and inspiration!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Those two ingredients were\nmissing from my writing.\nThat's why everything I wrote was never very\nentertaining.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], thanks to you, my\ncreative energy is growing!\nI'm going to write a best seller![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who would've thought the S.S. LIBRA'd be\nfound in the desert.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Am I ever glad I slept in that morning and\nmissed the S.S. LIBRA.\nI love the sea, but I can't stand the desert.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The newscaster lady on TV looks so pretty\nall the time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? The news?\nI don't pay attention to the news.\nEhehe.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: They said on the news that the S.S. LIBRA\nwas discovered in the desert.\nIt's like magic how it ended up there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, look, look.\nThey have the news story on the S.S. LIBRA.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not a pretty picture.\nWhat became of the POKéMON on board worries\nme.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes!\nSpeaking of POKéMON, I must tell you about\nthe robo POKéMON that KAMINKO gave me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: KAMINKO said it was no good,\nbut, oh no, it will make a fine robo POKéMON as\na vehicle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I finish it, I'll give you\na ride.\nYou be sure to look forward to that.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, look, look.\nThey have the news story on the S.S. LIBRA.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's not a pretty picture.\nWhat became of the POKéMON on board worries\nme.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I saw the news about how the\nS.S. LIBRA was found in the desert, too.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's going on in this world?\nThere shouldn't be a ship in the desert...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, JOVI's big brother!\nDid you see the news about the S.S. LIBRA?\nI'm worried about the POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We were watching the news about\nthe S.S. LIBRA.\nIt's a big mystery, isn't it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe I should make the novel\nI'm writing into a whodunit?\nNot to be precious about it, but I think that's\na wonderful idea![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH and his people left on the\nluxury CRUISER they'd moored here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm curious as to where they went every\nday while they were here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What is that boat?\nThe one that looks like a KYOGRE.\nIt looks like it goes fast!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I think it will be too scary for me--it\nmight make me have an accident.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH has gone away...\nHe left me with a gaping void where my heart\nonce fluttered...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, what am I to live for now?\nThere's no purpose to this life without him!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH!\nPlease, come back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH hasn't come around lately.\nWhat's wrong, I wonder?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A well-heeled customer like him doesn't just\ngrow on trees![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gahahaha!\nEat! Eat up! Then eat some more!\nEat to the last drop of strength!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Who cares if that MR. VERICH is gone?\nI still have to eat![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It makes me wonder what MR. VERICH was\nall about.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What?! CIPHER's boss?!\nY-you're pulling my leg.\nAhaha...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, I saw that news about the S.S. LIBRA\nsomehow washing up in the desert.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All over ORRE, there've been strange\ngoings-on.\nWhat is up with the place?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The mooches that hang out in the KRABBY\nCLUB are in an uproar, saying that MR. VERICH\nhasn't been around lately.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Where'd they come from, and where'd they\ngo?\nA mystifying bunch they were.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The MAGICIANS duo came back to the\nKRABBY CLUB.\nI'm so happy, I could cry!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Today, I'm going to feast, and on my own\nmoney, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yeah!\nThe MAGICIANS are as fine as ever![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sure, we've been on TV, but\nthat doesn't mean we've forgotten the KRABBY\nCLUB.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We should never forget our\nroots![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Tralilalilalala~♪\nMy dancing's got the edge again today!\nI'm so ultimate![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MR. VERICH hasn't visited in some time now.\nThat's hurt our business, definitely.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And that taut sense of tension that his group\nexuded...\nIt's a kind of thrill that can grow on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Harrumph!\nOur POKéMON-twosome act remains the world's\nbest for all time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They'll have to pry us off the KRABBY\nCLUB stage at the very end![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're on top of the world just like every\nother day.\nIt's almost frightening how good I feel.\nIt feels like I can live another hundred years![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Since the MAGICIANS came back, the\ncustomers haven't been heckling the performers\nas much.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a good thing, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nI'm in a slump...\nIt's deep and it's bad.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I go from extremes where I can\nwrite...and then I can't write at all.\nI run into writer's block all the time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nMaybe I should change the main character of\nthe novel I'm writing?\nHow's this?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The proudly solitary mad scientist\nof the eerie manor!\nHis name is DR. KAMINKO!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Do you think that will work?\nBut that man seems to be full of mystery, too...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Mommy's always like that.\nEMILI hasn't read any of Mommy's stories to\nthe very end.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Mommy is a genius at writing\nstories that don't have endings.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Recently, I saw a strange machine floating\ndown at the pier.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I do believe it belongs to MAKAN at the\nPARTS SHOP, but it's downright peculiar.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CITADARK ISLE is off the coast in the vicinity\nof GATEON PORT.\nThe ISLE is surrounded by fast-running currents.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: An ordinary ship would be swept off course\nin no time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Lately, the clouds cloaking CITADARK ISLE\nhave been roiling even more than usual.\nI hope it's not a sign of something bad.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Lately, I can't wait for the news to come on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The newscaster lady is so pretty!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? The news?\nI don't pay attention to the news.\nEhehe.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The PARTS SHOP's twosome were clanking\naway from morning to night making something\noutside their place.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm not really sure what it was.\nI guess it was some sort of a vehicle, but it sure\nwas shaped strangely.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo! [Player]!\nBig news!\nReal big news!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That ROBO KYOGRE we've been\ntelling you about is finally done!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Once Grandpa got down to it and\ngot serious with it, he put together something\nkind of amazing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Come over here, guy!\nYou have to listen to my grandpa![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I tell you, it's great.\nLook, I'm even giddy![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, now, you don't need to get\nso up close and personal with me.\nGo around to the other side of the counter.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Like PERR said, we've finally\nassembled the ROBO KYOGRE!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's truly a work of marvel...\nHm? What's wrong?\nIs anything the matter?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had been happening\nto MAKAN and PERR.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, I'll be!\nCIPHER's headquarters is on CITADARK ISLE?\nAnd you intend to go there?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CITADARK ISLE, huh?\nWhen it's on a place like that, it's no wonder\nnobody's found CIPHER's base.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The currents around the ISLE are\nswift, and the weather is always storming.\nThe place can't be approached by sea or by air.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: PERR.\nThat was certainly true before.\nBut now, however...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I get it, Grandpa!\nThe ROBO KYOGRE, right?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Precisely, PERR!\nOur ROBO KYOGRE will be able to reach the\nISLE!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, we must prepare to\nlaunch the ROBO KYOGRE for [Player]!\nCome, PERR![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yes, sir![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The people of this shop always leave the\nplace unattended.\nAre they okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're going to ride that odd thing they have\nout front?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you think that's wise?\nIt might sink like a stone![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Perhaps the ROBO KYOGRE was\nalways meant for you to ride from the start.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's all ready to go.\nYou can leave whenever you're ready.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no telling what you'll run\ninto on CITADARK ISLE.\nYou be careful.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If the going gets rough, you\nscoot back right away, okay?\nDon't try to overdo things.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yeah.\nI think the POKéMON MART has added new\nmerchandise.\nStock up on supplies before you go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey!\nHow'd it go?\nDid you make it across to CITADARK ISLE?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good to hear!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Didn't expect to see the ROBO\nKYOGRE become useful this way!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I bet DR. KAMINKO'd be amazed\nto hear it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?!\nDid it have a breakdown or something?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou went out on that weird boat after all?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And you went out to CITADARK ISLE on it?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Y-you can't be serious!\nYou shouldn't toy with your life like that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, so you did make it over to\nCITADARK ISLE!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Just as I thought, that machine\nwas no ordinary thing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If only KAMINKO would use his\ntalent in less peculiar ways, he would be a fine\ninventor, but...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm working up a plot that\nrevolves around DR. KAMINKO, but the material\nisn't quite up to snuff.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've discovered that he's been\ninventing odd things for a long time, but that's\nas far as I got...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nMaybe the plot had a little more vitality to it\nwhen MR. VERICH was the main character.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Or perhaps I should start fresh\nwith an entirely new main character.\nFor example...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Introducing MIROR B., the red\nand white TRAINER who wanders the land!\nHm...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's growing friendly toward you.\nIt seems to believe in you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It doesn't seem to be used to you yet.\nYou should treat it kindly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nIt's not friendly toward you.\nThe look in its eyes is frightening.\nYou should treat it more kindly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nThis is awful.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It detests you to a degree I hardly ever see.\nAre you sure you'll be okay?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nThis one has closed its heart, and is wary of\neverything around it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When you have a POKéMON like this, you\nshould really shower it with your love and make\nit experience fun things.\nThat will help ease its heart back open.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Kurabii...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kura kurabii...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whew...\nThat settles that!\nAll fixed!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...You want to talk to me?\n...Yeah, the PARTS SHOP is ours.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nYou need a MACHINE PART.\nWhere's Grandpa?\n...He's gone off to DR. KAMINKO's...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Arrrgh!\nWhen my grandpa gets excited over some\nmechanical thing, he's off like a shot, never mind\nthe shop or his grandson, me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll find that MACHINE PART you\nneed.\nCan I get you to come to our shop?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Man, Grandpa should be so lucky\nto have a caring grandson like me looking after\nhim.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm glad the BRIDGES have been fixed.\nIf they're stuck, no ship can get in or out of\nthe harbor.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The BRIDGES move when you step on the\nbutton in the middle section.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The shopkeeper wasn't thinking straight when\nhe got that clueless newbie to look after the\nshop.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now me, a regular customer, would be able\nto serve customers a lot better.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What is that up there?\nAtop of the LIGHTHOUSE, it looks like there's\na gigantic POKé BALL moving about.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've got to snap out of this!\nI must be seeing things.\nThat's what I get for not getting enough sleep.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, youngster, beware.\nThere's a peculiar character loitering at the top\nof the LIGHTHOUSE.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's peculiar about him?\nWell, he has a huge round head, for one thing.\nAnd his build is all stringy and gangly, but his\nmotions are all floppy and snaky.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What kind of diet do you have to be on to get\na build like that?\nThat's what I'd like to know.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There's an odd bunch of goons upstairs that\nhave kind of taken over the place.\nI can't go up there because they're intimidating.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's rather upsetting.\nI wish they'd go away soon.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: L-lad!\nW-who are those people?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They've startled me so much, I've become\nrooted to the spot![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What? What?\nNot you again!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our boss is busy dancing!\nYou can see that, can't you?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, Boss!\nThe way you gyrate is the greatest!\nShake, shake, shake!\nShake it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nYou brat!\nYou'd show up here?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why do you always mess with our\nplans to get all the POKéMON in the world?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: No thanks to you, we've lost\nmore POKéMON than we've caught![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ludi ludi colocolo.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ludi colocolo.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ludi colo ludi colo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ludi ludi colo![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I, I, I!\nWant you! Want you!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?!\nStop the music!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me wind down the music and\ntake a look!\nOh, you are!\nYou are that super-annoying brat!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's all your fault that my\nSHADOW POKéMON is the last of the kind!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But you did worse!\nYou messed up my dance for celebrating the\nfuture of TEAM MIROR!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Today of all days, you're not\ngoing to get away!\nNo, you'll never, never get away!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the music play![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fuhohoho!\nYou've come back again?\nYou super-annoying brat, you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My dance to celebrate our future\nis reaching a climax.\nI can't let you meddle now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how dare you!\nI say, how dare you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That SHADOW DRAGONITE was\nCIPHER'S very last SHADOW POKéMON!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's only one thing to do now!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's go!\nEscape![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?!\nBoss![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait for us![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? What is this?\nIn my perfectly coiffed afro do, I found this little\ndevice.[dialogue_end]
Bzzownt!\cNothing appears on the MIROR RADAR anymore.\nIt appears to have broken.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Lad, you were splendid!\nBut that odd fellow with the gigantic head...\nWho was that?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: At first, I thought he had a VOLTORB resting\non his shoulders.\nBut it turned out to be his hair...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It just goes to show there are strange people\nabout in the world.\nEven a POKéMON would be startled![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how dare you!\nI say, how dare you!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, I still have the SHADOW\nDRAGONITE with me!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All I need is a little rest.\nWhen I feel chipper again, I'll show you who's\nthe star with my elegant dance steps![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our boss MIROR B.'s dancing\nreally is the greatest, but...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Is the future really going to be\nbright for TEAM MIROR?\nSigh...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The boss is a man among men who\nlives to make all the world's POKéMON his!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He's not going to let a little thing\nlike losing to you bother him![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, not you again!\nDon't mess up our boss's dance performance!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our bright future together\ndepends on how it goes![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our boss is aiming for the world!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's no way that he'd lose to\nsome kid like you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, youngster, beware!\nThere are odd people still loitering at the top of\nthe LIGHTHOUSE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Since I last saw you, that weird bunch hasn't\nleft the top floor once.\nI can't go up there because they're intimidating.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's rather upsetting.\nI wish they'd go away soon.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: L-lad!\nWhen is that funny-headed man going to stop\nthat dancing of his?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's so startling, I've grown rooted to the\nspot![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait, wait!\nA strange man with a head like a POKé BALL\nwent running off!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I get it now!\nHe was up on the LIGHTHOUSE, wasn't he?\nI'm so glad that I wasn't seeing things![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou drove off that round-headed, gangly, snaky\nguy?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, isn't that good of you!\nYou've made it safe to walk these streets again.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello, lad.\nAre you taking a stroll in the LIGHTHOUSE, too?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The stairs here are excellent workouts for our\nold legs.\nHohohoho.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought it got quiet upstairs.\nSo those bizarre guys are gone, huh?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm glad to hear that.\nPeople will be able to visit the LIGHTHOUSE\nagain.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I look down from the top of the\nLIGHTHOUSE, I get that sensation of falling.\nIt grows on you, that feeling.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But the other night, I dreamt that I was at the\nLIGHTHOUSE, then I fell out of bed.\nI'm lucky it was just a dream![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: L-lad!\nYou're a ferocious battler!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm so awed, I've grown rooted to the spot![dialogue_end]
The CRY ANALYZER started up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nToo bad!\nI guess I lost that one!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That machine you have on your\narm, it's quite the getup!\nThe way the lights pulse and all, it's mighty\nimpressive, whatever it is!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I thought for a second there that\nyou'd taken my POKéMON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You know, lad, ever since\nI battled with you, I've been missing a POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's an important, precious even,\nPOKéMON I'd gotten as a gift.\nDo you have any idea what became of it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you, Mr. Cool Man.\nJOVI thanks you for saving JOVI earlier.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're busy here.\nOne thanks from you is plenty.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It wouldn't do if you got harassed\nby another fool.\nGo on home already.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're so lucky, big brother!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI wants something, too![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you want to speak to someone from the\nshop, there's one repairing the bridge outside.\nThat's who you should speak to.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish someone from the shop would come\nback soon.\nIt's not easy tending to a shop like this.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Bridge repair?\nThat bridge over the sea?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That bridge moves when you\nstep on a button in the middle.[dialogue_end]
But there was no response.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Kurrrabbiii![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: What was that all about?\nI joined that organization because they said\nthey'd give me a strong POKéMON--something\nthat's not like the usual ones.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, what was so tough about\nthat?\nI was conned![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The organization that I joined?\nI can't remember what they were called.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They said they didn't have\nenough supplies, so they wouldn't even give me\na uniform.\nMaybe they're poor.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you see the news?\nCIPHER's been brazen about what they do this\ntime around.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But I wonder...\nWhere'd they take all the POKéMON that were on\nthe S.S. LIBRA?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi!\nWe've been traveling around the ORRE REGION.\nWe've been jogging the whole time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Why don't you come run with us?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When we ran out to ECLO CANYON, we found\nthe building that was TEAM SNAGEM's HIDEOUT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'd heard that they broke up long ago, but I\ngot this feeling that there were people out there.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Maybe it was the ghosts of TEAM SNAGEM?\nAiyeeeeh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Little guy, I've seen your face somewhere\nbefore.\nAre you maybe a famous POKéMON TRAINER?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fu...\nI can tell.\nYour eyes have the look of someone good.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I bet your POKéMON are outstanding, too,\nlittle guy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If the opportunity ever arises, I'd like to have\na battle with you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fu...\nThough I doubt you could beat me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yo!\nWait! Wait up![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, my name's WILLIE.\nI remember who you are now, kid.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: You're the kid that sent CIPHER\npacking in PHENAC, aren't you?\nYou were on TV.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, listen.\nLet's have a battle, you and me.
[bubble_or_speaker]: What are you saying?\nYou're joshing, right?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeahah!\nThat's the spirit!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, all right.\nOver here, this way![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeeeeeeaaaah!\nI'm burning now!\nI'm on fire!\nIt's full-throttle time!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Vrum! Vrooom!\nLet's roll![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But, yeah, you're tough.\nReal tough, kid.\nYou stomped us good.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So long as you're around,\nORRE's future is safe![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey, it's you!\nJust the kid I wanted to see!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, I had the urge to have\nanother POKéMON battle with you.\nIt was like an itch I couldn't scratch!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, come on.\nLet's battle.\nI'm not losing this time![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But, yeah, you're tough.\nReal tough, kid.\nYou stomped us good.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi there, kid!\nToo bad about our last battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But you weren't going all out in\nthat last battle of ours.\nI could tell your heart wasn't in it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's have another battle!\nThis time, let's battle for real![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm HORDEL.\nAre you maybe [Player]?\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Am I glad to see you!\nI was terrified that CIPHER would find me and\ndrag me away if I stayed much longer.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You see, I fled from CIPHER's\nKEY LAIR way in the north.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nYou know that place?\nWow, you people at ONBS sure get information\nquickly.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The KEY LAIR is a factory.\nIt was made to mass-produce SHADOW\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I discovered that, I was\nhorrified.\nI came to hate my job, so I escaped.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When I fled, I managed to spirit\naway just one SHADOW POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But even then, there were\nalready many SHADOW POKéMON.\nI'm sure that they've produced even more since\nthen.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: While I was with CIPHER, there\nwere rumors about a boy who snags SHADOW\nPOKéMON and purifies them.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Might that person be you?\nIf so, I have a giant favor to ask of you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Would you purify the SHADOW\nTOGEPI that I fled from CIPHER with?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I see...\nThen I have no choice.\nI'll just have to raise it myself.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I want to return it to its natural\nstate as soon as possible, but I'm not good at\nbattling...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you so much!\nPlease take good care of it!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...I wish I could say that, but\nyour party is full.\nI can't pass this guy over to you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm sorry, but please make room\nin your party, then come back for it.[dialogue_end]
[Player] accepted HORDEL's SHADOW\nTOGEPI.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, there you go.\nPlease purify my little guy for me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I rescued a SHADOW TOGEPI\nwhen I fled from CIPHER.\nCan I please get you to purify it for me?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello.\nHow is my SHADOW TOGEPI doing?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Besides my little guy, there were\nmany POKéMON that had been turned into\nSHADOW POKéMON at CIPHER's KEY LAIR.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In my desperation to flee, I wasn't\nable to save other POKéMON...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It still gnaws at my conscience,\nwondering what became of the other POKéMON.\nIf only there were some way of saving them![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! The [some_pokemon_4E] in your\nparty is my [some_pokemon_4E], isn't it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You've finished its purification!\nOh, thank you!\nI'm so glad you're back to normal,\n[some_pokemon_4E]!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, may I have my [some_pokemon_4E]\nback?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm willing to trade you the\nELEKID I've been raising in return.\nWould that be okay?
[bubble_or_speaker]: I understand...\nI guess you would get attached to it after seeing\nit through its purification.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Though I feel a twinge of jealousy,\nplease take good care of my [some_pokemon_4E]\nfor me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you will!?\nGreat!\nLet's trade right away![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Great, our trade's done.\nPlease treat my ELEKID with kindness, the way\nyou did with my [some_pokemon_4E].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Even though that ELEKID is\ncute, it doesn't measure up against my\n[some_pokemon_4E] at all.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you so much for\npurifying it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hello, [Player].\nHow's my old [some_pokemon_4E]?\nIs it doing well?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've been thinking things over...\nWill you please trade your [some_pokemon_4E] for\nmy ELEKID?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Though I feel a twinge of jealousy,\nplease take good care of my [some_pokemon_4E]\nfor me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, [Player].\nHow have you been?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I beg your pardon?\nYou wrecked CIPHER's KEY LAIR, [Player]?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], are you perhaps\nreally tough as a TRAINER?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, so modest, too!\nBut the moment I laid my eyes on you, I sensed\nthat you were different.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess very talented people do\nhave a different atmosphere about them.\nIt's very impressive to see in someone so young\nas you![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, to think that my\n[some_pokemon_4E] was purified by someone as great\nas you...\nWhat an honor.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'll have to get you to autograph\nmy [some_pokemon_4E]'s back sometime![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, to have a fantastic\nTRAINER like you purify my POKéMON,\n[Player]...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My [some_pokemon_4E] is sure lucky.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Please treat my ELEKID with\nkindness, the way you did with my\n[some_pokemon_4E].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! The [some_pokemon_4E] in your\nparty is my [some_pokemon_4E], isn't it?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your [some_pokemon_4E] seems to be\nholding the item [some_item_2D].\nWill you trade it to me anyway?
[bubble_or_speaker]: By the way, are you searching for\nTEAM SNAGEM's HIDEOUT?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I passed it while fleeing from\nCIPHER's KEY LAIR.\nIt was in a desolate spot.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM must be a hardy\nbunch to put up with a building that far gone to\nrack and ruin.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm!\nAre you a new recruit seeking to join TEAM\nSNAGEM?\nOr just an intruder?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let me battle you and see![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You know what you're doing with\nyour POKéMON.\nI hate to admit it, but you've wiped me out.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We could use your toughness.\nCome, join TEAM SNAGEM!\nWe're always on the lookout for outstanding\ntalent![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nKid, didn't I see you before?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I get it now!\nYou were on the S.S. LIBRA when I went to\nget the SNAG MACHINE!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, I got it now.\nI won't have to agonize over this!\nYou're the kid from back there. I got it now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm with TEAM SNAGEM!\nBut I don't have a SNAG MACHINE, so I've never\nsnagged anything yet!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Do you understand how pathetic\nthat makes me feel?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When I joined up, the SNAG\nMACHINE was already gone![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waah! [Player]!\nDarn it!\nYou came to get the SNAG MACHINE back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I've already taken the SNAG\nMACHINE to the boss!\nGONZAP's mighty tough![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sheesh...\nThis wall hasn't been repaired for a long time...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It can't be helped because we\nhaven't made much money lately.\nThis just stinks...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?!\nWhile I was feeling sorry for myself, an intruder\nappeared![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You wait...\nWe'll get our spot in the sun back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you join up right now, you'll\nnot only get the day's wages, but also a\ncommuting allowance, and even a box lunch.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Depending on your qualifications,\nyou can even receive up to 20% more paid\nholidays!\nYou won't find terms this good... Huh?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Why, you...\nYou can't butt into a job interview!\nThis is what you'll get![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Nope, no way!\nI'm not letting anyone tougher than me join\nTEAM SNAGEM![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I came out because they promised to pay me\nthe day's wages and buy my lunch.\nWhat is this place all about, anyway?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM is on a membership\nrecruiting drive.\nWe need more people for taking the fight to\nCIPHER's HIDEOUT!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll hire anybody, even kids,\nif they're strong.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Excellent!\nYou've made the grade!\nWe'll battle no longer![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?!\nYou're raiding TEAM SNAGEM's HIDEOUT?!\nThat takes guts![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Back in the old days, just saying\nthe TEAM SNAGEM name made even crying kids\nshut up instantly.\nNow, we can't even beat a kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey, WAKIN!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But, uh...\nIt's not because the MACHINE's small, it's\nbecause your arm is so thick, GONZAP...[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Shut your yap!\nBring me something so useless as this...\nHuh?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who is that kid there?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hey! You!\nYou're that kid!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He must've come for the SNAG\nMACHINE!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Good work getting out here.\nBut we're not about to let you have it\nback.\nGive up now, kid![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heh, you're not as tough as the\nrumors say you are.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For a TRAINER at your level, there\nwas no need to put anything to sleep.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If we snag all the SHADOW\nPOKéMON from them using this SNAG MACHINE,\nCIPHER will collapse.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When that happens, TEAM\nSNAGEM will step up and take over!\nSo, how about it?\nWill you join us?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gwahahaha!\nDon't lie, because you're obviously no good\nat it!\nYour lips are twitching!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: All you really want to do is get\nthis SNAG MACHINE back, don't you?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine!\nYou'll have your SNAG MACHINE back, but only\nif you can beat me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right.\nYou mean to get this SNAG MACHINE back, no\nmatter what.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine!\nYou'll have your SNAG MACHINE back, but only\nif you can beat me![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What do you think you're doing\nhanging around like that?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Before you really tick off GONZAP,\nyou'd better get lost fast, I'm telling you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey.\nYou're weak in battle, but you do have guts.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Right now, we need this SNAG\nMACHINE more than we need your guts.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're going to be a pest, this\nis what you'll get![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If we had your expertise and the\nSNAG MACHINE, we'd have no trouble crushing\nCIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, fine!\nA promise is a promise!\nHere, take your SNAG MACHINE back.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nAre you serious, GONZAP?\nAfter all the trouble we went through to get it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Weren't we going to use that to\nteach CIPHER a lesson for dumping us?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This kid's fighting to bring\nCIPHER down, right?\nHim and us, we're both after the same thing.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Here, kid, take it.\nYou can have your SNAG MACHINE back.[dialogue_end]
[Player] got the SNAG MACHINE back![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That thing didn't fit my arm\nanyway.\nGwahahaha!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yeah!\nI may as well give you this, too!\nIt just goes to show how I can be generous![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a gift from me.\nThere's a chest in a corner on the ground floor.\nThat's the KEY for it.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, kid.\nGet going!\nCIPHER's secret factory is to the north.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We'll all be looking forward to\nyour crushing CIPHER!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's when TEAM SNAGEM will\nagain be in control!\nGwahahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You'd better appreciate GONZAP's\ngenerosity.\nYou repay him by sticking it to CIPHER!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We should be the only gang in\nORRE.\nThere's no room for two![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nSo the SNAG MACHINE ends up with you again...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn...\nAfter all the trouble we went through to get it,\ntoo.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You beat GONZAP in a battle?\nYeah, sure, tell me about it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GONZAP and WAKIN have gone\nout, and they haven't been back yet.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They didn't abandon us, did they?\n...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha!\nTh-they wouldn't do anything like that!\nLong live GONZAP![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You're [Player], aren't you?\nI met you on the S.S. LIBRA!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahahahaha!\nI won't forget about you again--don't you worry\nabout that![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nWhat are you doing here?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Didn't you meet up with GONZAP\nand WAKIN?\nThey went to help you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Are those two lost somewhere?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We're not doing job interviews\nanymore.\nTEAM SNAGEM's going to be run by a small\ncadre of elites![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is a good place.\nWhatever happens, they always give me a box\nlunch every day.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GONZAP and WAKIN came back\nfinally.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They sure had us worried, but\nnow things are back to normal.\nHehehe.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That SNAG MACHINE is sweet.\nI wish we'd kept it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GONZAP and WAKIN helped you?\nIs that right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sheesh.\nGONZAP has this weird sense of nobility and\nchivalry.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I guess you've earned his\nadmiration, whether it's welcome or not.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Heheh!\nMy GLOOM was useful, hey?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you have trouble sleeping, it'll\nhave you snoring in no time!\nHeheh![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, it's the kid!\nHow'd things turn out?\nThe look on your face tells me it went well,\nthough.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Good work!\nIf I had underlings like you, TEAM SNAGEM\nwould be set for life!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But you wait!\nOne of these days, I'll rebuild TEAM SNAGEM\nto its former glory!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When that happens, you'll be our\nsworn enemy!\nDon't be surprised when it happens!\nGaahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You know, we haven't snagged\nanything in a long time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, I was thinking, we should get\na new name.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What would be a good name for\nus, I wonder?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Before, our very name would\nscare even crying kids into silence.\nNow we're fading into obscurity...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's fantastic that GONZAP came\nback to us.\nBut we still can't snag anything.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This empty feeling...\nYou wouldn't understand it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nWhat is this stain on the wall...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Today might be my lucky day.\nGONZAP came back and everything.\nWe might finally get lucky![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GONZAP finally came back, but\nthen he took off again.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This time, WAKIN went, too.\nWhere'd they go this time?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GONZAP is still out.\nOh...\nWhen are we ever going to snag anything again?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This hollow feeling...\nYou wouldn't understand it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: GONZAP has gone off somewhere.\nI think it was to ORRE COLOSSEUM with some\ntrusty minions.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I want to go out, too!\nI'm sick of counting stains on the walls![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nAre there fewer members than before?\nI must be tired or something.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That SNAG MACHINE you say you went and\ngot, what's up with it?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's too honking small!\nHow am I supposed to fit this on my arm?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, hey, not bad!\nPretty impressive, if I may say so!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, kid.\nWhy don't you join us, and we'll smash CIPHER\ntogether.\c
It's locked.[dialogue_end]
[Player] used GONZAP'S KEY.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait!\nWho goes there?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You must be a burglar!\nCHOBIN will put you straight!\nDon't you move!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is the name!\nAnd CHOBIN is the number-one assistant to\nDR. KAMINKO!\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is the only assistant,\nso CHOBIN has to be the number-one assistant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?!\nCHOBIN beat you, but you came back!\nThat's gutsy, at least!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However!\nCHOBIN will teach you that some things will be\nimpossible no matter how often you try![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You've made CHOBIN angry now!\nEven though CHOBIN lost, you're still not going\npast CHOBIN!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nCloser observation reveals that the subject is\na child.\nErgo, the subject is not a burglar!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha!\nCHOBIN wishes you spoke up right away.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're [Player]?\nCHOBIN apologizes for jumping to the wrong\nconclusion.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You took your time coming.\nCHOBIN was beginning to worry that you\nwouldn't come.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, this way, please!\nFollow CHOBIN![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN lost!\nOh, this is devastating to CHOBIN!\nCHOBIN demands a rematch!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Anyway, let CHOBIN acquaint you\nwith just some of DR. KAMINKO's greatest\ninventions.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the VCR roll![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN was trying to teach this\nburglar a lesson...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, yes!\nThat's it!\nROBO TRAINERS!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: No, wait...\nThere's something wrong with that idea...\nHmm...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, CHOBIN needs your help!\nDo something about that little girl, please.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She keeps taking things from the\nmanor and hiding them under this floor.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, the things she takes\nare not needed, so that in itself is not a problem\nfor CHOBIN.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that space is open to below,\nso it could be dangerous if anything were to fall.\nCHOBIN asks if you would say something to her.
[bubble_or_speaker]: However, CHOBIN realizes\nperhaps she is not likely to listen to you anyway.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: That is true.\nShe does not appear to be a girl who will listen\nand obey anyone's instructions.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nMay CHOBIN ask if you would inspect the\nCRANE ROOM on occasion from now on?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, you're a lifesaver!\nCHOBIN is no friend of high places.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you find anything, CHOBIN\nwon't know if you took it, so take it.\nBut don't take CHOBIN's treasures!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, [Player], CHOBIN is\ncounting on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, please!\nIf there is anything there, CHOBIN won't know if\nyou took it, so take it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is no friend of high\nplaces!\nUh... Does that girl know, maybe?\nIs that why she does it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The room downstairs... You went\ndown there?\nCHOBIN's treasure--which is hidden in the chest\nin the rear--you didn't touch it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nOnly sheets of white paper were in it?\nThat cannot be!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Those were blueprints for\nCHOBIN's inventions over the years.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What is CHOBIN to do?\nCHOBIN cannot remember all the inventions that\nhave been attempted!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh...\nThat paper must have been it!\nDR. KAMINKO's invention--the paper that makes\nink fade over time...[dialogue_end]
It's filled with stacks of white paper.[dialogue_end]
It's filled with stacks of white paper.\nThere is writing on them.\nTry reading something?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Plupluh![dialogue_end]
It's JOVI'S PLUSLE!\nIt's cavorting playfully.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Maimaii![dialogue_end]
It's JOVI's MINUN.\nIt seems happy to see [Player].[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, CHOBIN needs your help!\nDo something about that little girl, please.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She keeps taking things from the\nmanor and hiding them under CHOBIN's room.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Of course, the things she takes\nare not needed, so that in itself is not a problem\nfor CHOBIN.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that space is open to below,\nso it could be dangerous if anything were to fall.\nCHOBIN asks if you would say something to her.
[bubble_or_speaker]: The BATTLE CDs in this manor?\nWhat do you gain by asking me that?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't enjoying admitting it one\nbit, but they are quite well made.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...I have no interest in such\nthings!\nI acquired them purely for research.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: They should still be lying around\nhere and there.\nIf they are what you desire, you're welcome to\nthe whole lot.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MIMI![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MIMI!\nLet's go home with big brother![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you come from the POKéMON\nHQ LAB?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My name's MAKAN.\nI run the PARTS SHOP in GATEON PORT.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: How is the LAB's DIRECTOR?\nPROF. KRANE, yes?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, yes.\nIf you'd be so kind, please tell the PROFESSOR\nthat the MACHINE PART he needed is ready,\nand that he should come get it anytime.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: However, CHOBIN realizes\nperhaps she is not likely to listen to you anyway.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my, even this young lady\ncame from the POKéMON HQ LAB?\nTake care on your way home.[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: You there!\nYou, child!\nThat area is off-limits![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nIncidentally, child, how long have you been\nhere?\nHmm...?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That is true.\nShe does not appear to be a girl who will listen\nand obey anyone's instructions.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You must be another burglar!\nCHOBIN will put you straight!\nDon't you move!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is the name!\nAnd CHOBIN is the number-one assistant to\nDR. KAMINKO!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is still the only assistant,\nso CHOBIN has to be the number-one assistant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?!\nCHOBIN beat you, but you came back!\nThat's gutsy, at least!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However!\nCHOBIN will teach you that some things will be\nimpossible no matter how often you try![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nOh, you're that boy from before?!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN wishes you spoke up\nright away.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is that so.\nBut you being here in person now, do have\na look at DR. KAMINKO's inventions.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You may say anything, but DR.\nKAMINKO's inventions are number one in the\nwhole wide world!\nCHOBIN is full of admiration![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu...\nWhen this robo is completed, I shall become\nthe world's most powerful man!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu...\nWaahahaha!\nHuh?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who are you?!\nHow long have you been there?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I... I...\nI'm in the middle of highly important research.\nI'm quite busy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I ask\nthat you refrain from disturbing me.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: [Player], you are that girl's\nolder brother?\nSometimes, she comes here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: She wanders around everywhere.\nCHOBIN finds it hard keeping an eye on her so\nthat she does not bother the DOCTOR.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes!\n[Player], you will have a look at DR.\nKAMINKO's inventions?\nYou will, yes?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, this way, please!\nFollow CHOBIN![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahaha!\nIncredible, is it not?\nThere is much more than that, too.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The DOCTOR's inventions, which\nare fantastic, can be seen on this monitor.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN gives you permission to\nuse this anytime you like.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?!\nWho goes there?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nOn close inspection, it's you again.\nCHOBIN wishes you spoke up right away.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The DOCTOR is currently busy.\nHe is developing a secret robo that is strictly\na secret to everyone.\nBut CHOBIN is not busy.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is, in fact, bored.\nAhahaha.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nCHOBIN will now show you the inventions of the\ninestimable DR. KAMINKO.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: DR. KAMINKO's inventions, it\nneeds to be said, are number one in the world!\nCHOBIN is full of admiration!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh?\nWhy does CHOBIN know that they are number\none worldwide?\nThat needs explaining?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In the whole wide world, no one\nbut DR. KAMINKO would invent such inventions!\nTherefore, they are number one in the world\nwithout question!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our DR. KAMINKO, who is verily\ngreat, is inventing in that room there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-oh!\nThat girl is at DR. KAMINKO's side again!\nCHOBIN hopes she is causing no disturbance.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no, mustn't go in there.\nThat's where corporate secrets are kept.\nEntry is very much prohibited.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN's treasure is secretly\nkept there, too.\nBut that is also a corporate secret.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait!\nWho goes there?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You must be yet another burglar!\nWhy are there so many burglars?\nCHOBIN will put you straight!\nDon't you move!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN am I!\nAnd CHOBIN is the number-one assistant to\nDR. KAMINKO!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is still the only assistant,\nso CHOBIN has to be the number-one assistant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?!\nCHOBIN beat you, but you came back!\nThat's gutsy, at least!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However!\nCHOBIN will teach you that some things will be\nimpossible no matter how often you try![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN!\nWhat is the meaning of all your shouting?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh!\nDR. KAMINKO!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Burglar?\nA burglar, you say?\nNo mercy need be given to a burglar!\nLet the just-completed "it" handle him![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DOCTOR, you don't mean...\nIt?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I said it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN understands!\nIt, it is![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You wait!\nYou are going to get it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fufufu...\nSoon, yes, very soon, you will see what we\nhave in store for you!\nIf you wish to flee, let it be now!
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hahah!\nSo, you quail at my invention!\nThen begone, and quick![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah...\nSo, your intention is to burgle, no matter what!\nA harsh lesson needs to be taught![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine!\nLet us begin!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Tweet!\nThough the rumble of thunder fills the air,\nthe weather remains free of clouds!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let thunder tear the skies and\nrend the earth!\nThe time has come for the ultimate ROBO\nPOKéMON to finally reveal itself![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Come hither, ROBO GROUDON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ROBO GROUDON, go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gawoooh!\nThis is who you battle!\nYou've been warned![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, not deterred by defeat?\nYou wish for another bout with my ROBO\nGROUDON?\nYou are one determined burglar!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But my ROBO GROUDON, which\nI've created, is the toughest ever!\nGo, CHOBIN![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Gawooh!\nCHOBIN will school you again and again![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: But, but...\nHow could this be?\nMy ROBO GROUDON go down in defeat?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh? Oh!\nOn closer inspection...\nIt's [Player]!\nA while it's been![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wh-what?!\nOur alleged burglar is merely CHOBIN's\nacquaintance?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...And a child, no less!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Bah!\nEnough!\nEnough of this nonsense!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Given the ROBO GROUDON's\nutter failure, the half-built ROBO KYOGRE\ndoesn't inspire confidence.\nI doubt it will ever be useful.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN!\nSee to it that the ROBO KYOGRE is disposed of\nas scrap by MAKAN at the PARTS SHOP.\nUnderstood?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hah?\nWe're dropping development of the ROBO\nKYOGRE?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's finished, over and done with,\nkaput!\nThe whole ROBO POKéMON Plan is canceled![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: DOCTOR, wait!\nPlease, CHOBIN would like to keep the ROBO\nGROUDON at least.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nI have no interest in any robo I've scrapped.\nAs you wish.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nAfter all we did to bring it so close to\ncompletion...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN wants to know what\nbrought you here today.\n...CHOBIN sees, you wanted to see the PARTS\nSHOP man.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: MAKAN is in the manor.\nCHOBIN suggests you go in and have a look.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In the meantime, CHOBIN must\nput away the ROBO GROUDON...\c
[Player] taught CHOBIN the P★DA number.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN will modify the ROBO\nGROUDON.\nCHOBIN would like a rematch when the work is\ndone.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: MAKAN should be in the manor.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nWherein lay the weakness of my ROBO\nPOKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, eureka!\nNext time, I shall make a real POKéMON drive it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: No, wait.\nSomething about that plan sounds extraneous...\nHmm...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: You, child!\nThat area is strictly prohibited...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, never mind.\nThe basement R&D ROOM is no longer home to\nany secrets.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You may come and go as you\nwish, but try not to disturb MAKAN inside.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmhm...\nSo this is the ROBO KYOGRE that KAMINKO had\nunder development.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: He called it useless scrap and\ndemanded that I haul it away.\nBut, you know, this is quite a well-engineered\nmachine.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa!\nYou've given me quite the start!\nAnd who might you be?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: And yet another burglar!\nCHOBIN will put you straight!\nDon't you move!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is the name!\nAnd CHOBIN is the number-one assistant to\nDR. KAMINKO!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is forever the only\nassistant, so CHOBIN has to be the number-one\nassistant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nOh, it's you, [Player].\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Is it possible that you came for\na battle with my ROBO GROUDON?\nCHOBIN sadly must announce that the\nmodification work is not yet done.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN suggests you curb your\nenthusiasm.\nAn E-MAIL will be sent when ROBO GROUDON is\nready, so wait for that eagerly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN will send an E-MAIL when\nthe ROBO GROUDON's modification is finished.\nCHOBIN would like to battle at that time.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nI have grown weary of tricking others with\npeculiar inventions...\nThe ROBO POKéMON were no good...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nI need a new purpose in life...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Umm...\nThe new ROBO GROUDON is supreme!\nThere, all done!\nSend!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nOh, it's you, [Player].\nSince when were you there?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, how about that.\nCHOBIN didn't need to send an E-MAIL.\nBut, that's fine.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN has successfully\nupgraded the ROBO GROUDON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What modification has been\nmade is a secret, though.\nLet's begin![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahahah!\nThe upgrade has snatched victory!\nCHOBIN is the victor!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN considers you the loser\nfrom now on![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: So strange...\nCHOBIN had upgraded the driver's seat with\na reclining back...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Was that not enough?\nNot enough to snatch victory?\nCHOBIN is in utter shock![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah!\n[Player]!\nCHOBIN welcomes your most timely arrival.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN, this time has fitted the\nROBO GROUDON with a power-up component!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Now!\nCHOBIN wishes to know if a battle with the newly\npowered up ROBO GROUDON is what you desire.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahahah!\nCHOBIN will thoroughly acquaint you with the\ngreatness that is the ROBO GROUDON![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahahah!\nYou were frightened off by the amazingly\npowered up ROBO GROUDON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN's hypothesis has been\nproven!\nROBO POKéMON are absolutely the toughest,\nno question.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The DOCTOR must be informed![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ahahah!\nAmazing, isn't it, my ROBO GROUDON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The latest modification is a\nfantastic success!\nNo more defeats are in CHOBIN's horizon![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN loses!\nEven after adding an air conditioner for the\nultimate in atmospheric comfort![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is willing to accept your\nevery challenge for battle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN and the ROBO GROUDON\nwill grow more powerful by gaining experience![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN has exhausted personal\nfunds.\nModifications can no longer be afforded.\nCHOBIN will battle on guts alone from now on.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Waah!\nWhat are you doing there?!\nHow long have you been there?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hmm...\nI have grown weary of tricking others with\npeculiar inventions...\nThe ROBO POKéMON were no good...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Sigh...\nI need a new purpose in life...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN went off on a battle\nquest saying he will demonstrate the power of\nROBO POKéMON to the world.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that's not necessary.\nAfter all, the ROBO POKéMON are the ultimate.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: After all, one is playing a key\nrole in bringing CIPHER down.\nFuhahahahah![dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Big brother!\nWhat are you doing here?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! JOVI gets it!\nBig brother, you got lost, didn't you?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hehehe, JOVI thought so!\nBig brother, you look dependable, but then you\nmake silly mistakes!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-uh-uh!\nThere's no hiding stuff from JOVI!\nBecause JOVI knows!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: This big house is DR. KAMINKO's.\nDR. KAMINKO's job is to make incredible\ninventions.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There's a whole bunch of neat\nmachines like they have at the POKéMON\nHQ LAB.\nYou should come in too, big brother.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, big brother!\nThis is a funny drawing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a really detailed drawing of a\nreally weird machine![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...Huh?\nAre you going home already, big brother?\nBut you just got here!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh... JOVI gets it!\nJOVI has to show you how to go home, right?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nThat's what JOVI will do!\nJOVI will take you home!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nLet's move out!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI will visit again, DOCTOR!\nBye-bye![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: We will!\nJOVI will come for another visit![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's how DR. KAMINKO is all\nthe time.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN said that a genius has\ndifferent sensibilities from ordinary people.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Does "sensibilities" mean you're\nkind of absentminded and in a fog?\nDon't people say PROF. KRANE is a genius?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI will take big brother home\ntoday, so JOVI has to go, too!\nBye-bye!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Next time JOVI comes, please let\nJOVI try those googly glasses!\nPromise![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN cannot possibly make\nthat sort of a promise.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: She is your sister?\nDo something about her, please.\nShe never listens to what CHOBIN says, ever.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When she is here, CHOBIN's work\ngoes off-kilter.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Googly, googly glasses!\nIf JOVI puts them on, will everything look all\ngoogly?\nIt sounds exciting![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, silly CHOBIN!\nWhat are you looking at?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Today, JOVI is very busy.\nJOVI has a very important job with JOVI's\nassistant, big brother.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The DOCTOR's inventions, which\nare quite fantastic, CHOBIN here has compiled\nand edited.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The video can be viewed anytime\non the monitor in the entrance.\nStop by and look.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well?\nYou may say anything, but DR. KAMINKO's\ninventions are number one in the whole wide\nworld![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I don't know.\nWhat JOVI likes best is CHOBIN's googly\nglasses.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Th-these are strictly off-limits.\nCHOBIN cannot function without them.\nExtremely, absolutely not.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww!\nThat's so boring.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The DOCTOR's inventions, which\nare quite fantastic, can be viewed anytime on\nthe monitor in the entrance.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Instead of DR. KAMINKO, what\nJOVI likes best are CHOBIN's googly glasses.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello there.\n[Player], was it?\nYou've come calling with your young sister\nagain?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wrong!\nToday, we are going to GATEON PORT on a very\nimportant job.\nBig brother is JOVI's assistant![dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what had been happening\nto MAKAN.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What was that?!\nThe HQ LAB's DIRECTOR was abducted?\nThat's terrible...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Their modus operandi...\nIt feels similar to that incident five years ago.\nIt may be CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But one can't conclusively say\nthat.\nBefore we get to thinking, you need your\nMACHINE PART.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's waiting for you at my shop in\nGATEON PORT.\nHave a word with my grandson PERR.\nHe should know.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Your MACHINE PART is waiting\nfor you at my shop in GATEON PORT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Have a word with my grandson\nPERR.\nHe'll fetch it up right away for you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Whoa!\nYou've given me quite the start!\nOh, it's you, lad.\nWhat's up today?\c
[Player] explained what had been happening\nto MAKAN.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm...\nCIPHER is back, then.\nI thought they'd folded five years ago, but\nthey've returned.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, you want me to modify your\nSCOOTER for desert-crossing performance?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, you certainly are bold for\neven considering to face CIPHER alone.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Fine, let's do it.\nI'll modify your SCOOTER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Good deeds shouldn't wait.\nI'll arrange to haul this ROBO KYOGRE back to\nmy shop right away.\nI'll see you there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The girl isn't here today?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Good!\nCHOBIN can't work if CHOBIN is without these\nspectacles.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The DOCTOR's inventions can be\nseen on the monitor.\nDo take a look![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hm?\nWhat's that you say?!\nThe ROBO KYOGRE is proving useful in the fight\nagainst CIPHER?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Wa... Wahaha!\nWell, of course!\nThe ROBO KYOGRE's power is mighty!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I predicted that this would be the\noutcome, so I secretly gave it to MAKAN.\nWaha...\nWahahaha![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wrong!\nToday, we went to GATEON PORT on a very\nimportant job.\nBig brother is JOVI's assistant![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What was that?!\nThe HQ LAB's DIRECTOR was abducted?\nThat's terrible...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Their modus operandi...\nIt feels similar to that incident five years ago.\nIt may be CIPHER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But one can't conclusively say\nthat.\nBefore we get to thinking, your MACHINE PART\nneeds to go.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Quickly, deliver that MACHINE\nPART to the POKéMON HQ LAB.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, good.\nI see you've collected your MACHINE PART.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Did you come from the POKéMON\nHQ LAB?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: My name's MAKAN.\nI run the PARTS SHOP in GATEON PORT.\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: How is the LAB's DIRECTOR?\nPROF. KRANE, yes?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Quickly, deliver that MACHINE\nPART to the POKéMON HQ LAB.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes.\nMay CHOBIN ask if you would inspect the\nCRANE ROOM on occasion from now on.
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wow, you're a lifesaver!\nCHOBIN is no friend of high places.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you find anything, CHOBIN\nwon't know if you took it, so take it.\nBut don't take CHOBIN's treasures!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, [Player], CHOBIN is\ncounting on you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, please!\nIf there is anything there, CHOBIN won't know if\nyou took it, so take it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is no friend of high\nplaces!\nUh... Does that girl know, maybe?\nIs that why she does it?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What is it? What is it?\nE-MAIL from the PROFESSOR?\nHe wants you to come home quickly?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: JOVI is worried about letting you\ngo by yourself, big brother.\nSo JOVI will go home, too!\nLet's go right now![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hi, DOCTOR!\nWhat kind of funny machine are you making this\ntime?\nJOVI wants to know.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN is impressed!\nIt would take a genius of DR. KAMINKO's caliber\nto invent a singing robot!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, [Player], look here!\nIt's the DOCTOR's new invention!\nThe singing robot!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nThe real thing?\nThat can't be real![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN feels privileged for seeing\nan unexpected facet of the DOCTOR's character.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, yes!\n[Player], CHOBIN would like your P★DA\nnumber, if you will be so kind.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: The POKéMON TRANSLATOR?\nHow odd, child.\nIt surprises me that you would know something\nso old.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There are only 13 in the world.\nThat was the greatest achievement in my early\nyears.\n...Or, it should have been.[dialogue_end]
JOVI joined the party.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nBut why would that machine...\nAnyways, this could be rather problematical.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It won't come off unless a VOICE\nCASE is used.\nHmm...\nAch, it can't be helped.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That VOICE CASE holds a\nPOKéMON's cry.\nOf what POKéMON, I don't know.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What you must do is play that cry\nat the POKéMON that cries in the same way.\nThat should disengage the TRANSLATOR.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you wish to hear the cry,\ntell me.\nI shall play it for you anytime.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I will find others for you.\nCome back after a time.\nThat will do.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I will play the cry contained in\nthat VOICE CASE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ah, so the POKéMON was cured.\nThat is good to hear.\nIncidentally, I've found another VOICE CASE.\nTake it with you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?\nThe VOICE CASE failed to work?\nBah, it must be defective!\nIt must be trashed! Trashed, I say![dialogue_end]
DR. KAMINKO took VOICE CASE 4 away from\n[Player] and threw it away![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Is something the matter?[dialogue_end]
[Player] told DR. KAMINKO about MEGG's\nE-MAIL.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What?\nThe same problem showed up in PYRITE?\nWhat kind of POKéMON is affected this time?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: SHROOMISH, you say?\nIt just so happens that I have the VOICE CASE\ncontaining SHROOMISH's cry right here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I listened to it a little while ago,\nso that is it without question.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, quickly!\nOff you go to save that POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now what?!\nThe POKéMON TRANSLATOR may have been\nused in GATEON PORT and PHENAC?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But why now, of all things?\nI'm positive that I'd locked the units away in\nthe basement...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: It must have been CHOBIN!\nThe ninny...\nOf all things to do...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: The POKéMON TRANSLATORS are\nindividually protected with secret passwords.\nI've forgotten what they were, however.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Take this CRY ANALYZER and\nsay something to the affected POKéMON.\nA quiz will appear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The answer is the secret\npassword.\nAs such, if the quiz is answered correctly,\nthe TRANSLATOR will detach.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, listen.\nYou must go and detach all the POKéMON\nTRANSLATORS that are scattered throughout\nthe ORRE REGION.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nThere is a POKéMON TRANSLATOR that is not\naffected by a VOICE CASE and won't display\na quiz?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It seems unlikely, but it may be\ndefective...\nThere is but one other way for detaching that\nTRANSLATOR...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Speak to it with a POKéMON's\nvoice.\nIf it opens its heart to you, the TRANSLATOR\nshould detach immediately.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But that hardly seems possible.\nThis is vexing...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nYou've returned with all thirteen POKéMON\nTRANSLATORS?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The last one was supposedly\ndefective and defied removal.\nHow on earth was that detached?[dialogue_end]
[Player] explained how SENILOR removed\nthe last TRANSLATOR to DR. KAMINKO.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: M-my goodness!\nThere was a human being that could detach\nthat blasted machine using that method...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: ...\nThat machine is an abject failure that I had\ninvented in my naive youth.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Back then, I felt that there was\nnothing that I could not achieve.\nHowever...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I was mistaken thinking that\nforcibly translating the cries of POKéMON will let\nus understand what lies in the hearts of\nPOKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It was arrogant of me.\nWorse, there was no need for it.\nThere are people who can communicate with\nPOKéMON on a heart-to-heart basis.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: But all that is in the past.\nSomething that is best forgotten!\nAfter all, to this day, I remain the authority on\ninventing!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now, if you'll excuse me, for I am\nquite busy.\nI must get on with my latest inventions![dialogue_end]
[Player] explained what was happening in\nAGATE VILLAGE to DR. KAMINKO.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: CHOBIN, come here!\nCHOBI...\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh... Never mind.\nChild, you're involved now.\nYou go detach the\nPOKéMON TRANSLATOR units.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that?\nYou have no more VOICE CASES?\nI have none, either.\nVery well, take this instead.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What's that you say?\nThere is a POKéMON TRANSLATOR that is not\naffected by a VOICE CASE and won't display\na quiz?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It seems unlikely, but it may be\ndefective...\nVery well, I shall investigate why.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Listen, child.\nIn the meantime, go forth and detach the\nTRANSLATORS from other POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, people!\nIt's time for POFTY's Fast-Break Report!\nWe bring you news while it's breaking!\c[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Today, we're visiting DUKING,\nthe discoverer of POKé SPOTS where wild\nPOKéMON appear.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: DUKING, so is this the POKé SPOT\nthat you discovered?[dialogue_end]
[maybe_speaker_ID_toggle][bubble_or_speaker]: Hello, DUKING here!\nYeah, that's absolutely right!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For fifteen long and torturous\nyears I toiled, snatching sleep only grudgingly,\nto find this POKé SPOT![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fifteen years?!\nIs that true?![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Yeah, uh...\nOne shouldn't let details get in the way of the\nstory, isn't that right, BETTY?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's POFTY![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right!\nLet me explain how one goes about attracting\nwild POKéMON to a POKé SPOT.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well...\nSeeing as you're here, wouldn't it be better if\nI got someone to demonstrate?\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! You there!\nYes, you, kid!\nYou'll be perfect.\nCome over here, mate![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Psst! POFTY, trouble!\nBad trouble!\nYour makeup's running from your sweat![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you should consider\nyourself lucky!\nDUKING himself will show you how in person![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, wait, mate.\nNot over there.\nI need you over this way, between me and\nBETTY, right?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's POFTY![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, my friend.\nLet me show how you attract wild POKéMON\nto a POKé SPOT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: First, and above all else, you\nneed these: DUKING brand POKé SNACKS.\nHere, I'll give you some.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, my friend.\nLay those POKé SNACKS out on that plate there.\nGo on now.[dialogue_end]
How many POKé SNACKS will you place?
[Player] placed [unknown_2F]\nPOKé SNACKS on the POKé SPOT.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Very good, mate.\nThat's how you do it!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When you've laid out the POKé\nSNACKS, leave the area.\nEventually, a wild POKéMON will come along, just\nyou wait.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The more POKé SNACKS you lay\nout, the longer a POKéMON will stay to eat,\nmaking it that much easier to catch.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This is also important.\nMy specially made SPOT MONITOR.\nThis, I'm sure you'll agree, is truly something\nawesome![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: All right, now you're set!\nNow, when a wild POKéMON appears at any POKé\nSPOT, your SPOT MONITOR will respond and alert\nyou.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I've found three POKé SPOTS\nin all.\nThere's one to the west of this one here.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: After laying out the POKé\nSNACKS, get away from the POKé SPOT and wait\nfor a wild POKéMON to come along.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: While you're waiting, it wouldn't\nhurt to check other POKé SPOTS.\nA wild POKéMON will appear sometime.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When one does show up, your\nSPOT MONITOR will alert you.\nThen, all you have to do is get back to the right\nPOKé SPOT.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, right.\nYou can also check how many POKé SNACKS are\nleft on the SPOT MONITOR.\nLearn to use it, my friend![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you are so lucky!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To get a private lesson from\nDUKING himself, I mean.\nIt makes me a little envious!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh! Goodness!\nIs the camera still rolling?!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: [bubble_or_speaker]'s Fast-Break\nReport!\nOur guest today was DUKING.\nSee you again next time![dialogue_end]

There are basically two types of battles.\nBattles against POKéMON TRAINERS, and battles\nagainst wild POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Battles against POKéMON TRAINERS
TRAINER battles can take a variety of forms.\nStandard battles are conducted with TRAINERS\nyou meet while traveling.\cThere are also event-type battles that are\nconducted at facilities such as the COLOSSEUMS\nin the ORRE REGION.\cThere are also BATTLE SIMs conducted using\nBATTLE SIM SYSTEMS.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]How do I win a battle?
A POKéMON loses HP if it is hurt in a battle.\nIt faints if it loses all its HP, and becomes\nincapable of battling.\cYou win by making all your opponent's POKéMON\nfaint.\cThe reverse is also true.\nIf all your POKéMON faint, you lose.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]The battle screen
Information about the opponent's POKéMON is\ndisplayed on panels on the upper right of the\nscreen, while your information is on the\nupper left.\cEach panel shows the respective POKéMON's HP\nand status.\cAt the lower part of the screen, the battle menu\nis displayed.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Using POKéMON moves
When a battle starts, select "FIGHT" in the battle\nmenu.\nThis opens the move menu which lists the moves\nthe POKéMON knows.\cWhen a move is selected, its Power Points (PP)\nare shown at the right.\nThe PP indicates how many more times the\nselected move can be used.\cIf a move's PP is "0," that move can't be used.\nBeware of that.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Switching the battling POKéMON
In the battle menu, select "POKéMON" to display\nall the POKéMON that are in your party.\cOn the left are the two POKéMON in battle.\cOn the right-hand side, your party POKéMON not\nin battle (if any) are displayed.\cSelecting a POKéMON displays a menu.\nUse the "SHIFT" command in the menu to switch\nthe selected POKéMON with another one.\cShift your POKéMON in and out of battle\ndepending on type matchups and the situation.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Using items in battle
Select "ITEM" in the battle menu to use an item\nyou have.\cSome items may not be used in battles, however.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Calling a POKéMON in battle
Select "CALL" in the battle menu to call out to\nthe chosen POKéMON.\cThe called POKéMON's attack accuracy rises.\nA call will also awaken a sleeping POKéMON.\cThe "CALL" command appears to have other\nspecial effects.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]EXP. Points
Your POKéMON that are in battle gain EXP. Points\n(Experience Points) whenever an opponent's\nPOKéMON faints.\cHowever, your POKéMON will not obtain\nEXP. Points in certain COLOSSEUM BATTLES and\nBATTLE SIMs.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Rewards for winning
If you defeat a POKéMON TRAINER in a battle\nduring your travels, you will be rewarded with\nmoney.\cYou may also receive other rewards in certain\nCOLOSSEUM BATTLES and BATTLE SIMs such as\nTECHNICAL MACHINES (TM) and POKé COUPONS.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Leveling up
When a POKéMON earns a certain amount of\nEXP. Points, it will level up.\cUpon leveling up, the POKéMON's stats--such\nas HP, ATTACK, DEFENSE, and so on--will\nbe improved.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Learning a new move
When a POKéMON levels up, it may learn a new\nmove.\cHowever, if the POKéMON already knows the\nmaximum four moves, one of the existing moves\nmust be forgotten for the new move to be\nlearned.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Evolution
Upon leveling up, POKéMON may learn new\nmoves.\nSome will even evolve.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Status problems and healing
When attacked in battle, POKéMON may suffer\na status problem such as a burn, paralysis,\nor even faint.\cIf such a problem arises, POKéMON can be\nhealed using the appropriate items.\nThey may also be healed at POKéMON CENTERS,\nHEALING MACHINES, and so on.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]Types of moves
There are many kinds of moves.\nBesides those that inflict damage, there are\nsome that provide protection, and some that\ncause status problems.\cTry to learn the effects of moves and use them\nto your advantage.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]What makes a move super effective?
If an attack move's type matches up favorably\nagainst the defending POKéMON's type, it will\nbecome super effective and cause extra damage.\cChoose your move types to suit the target's type\nfor the best effect.\nThis is an important point for battling effectively.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]What makes a move not very effective?
Depending on the attack move's type\nand the target's type, some moves may\nnot be very effective, or even\ncompletely ineffective.\cChoose your move types to suit the\ntarget's type for the best effect.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]POKéMON-leveling tip
Any POKéMON that takes part in a winning battle\nearns EXP. Points.\nIt's possible to have a weak POKéMON earn\nEXP. Points safely.\cPlace it at the top of the POKéMON list, then\nshift it out as soon as a battle starts.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]SINGLE and DOUBLE BATTLES
In a SINGLE BATTLE, POKéMON are sent into\nbattle one at a time.\nIn a DOUBLE BATTLE, POKéMON are sent into\nbattle two at a time.\cAmong the POKéMON moves, there are some that\naffect two POKéMON on either side, or even all\nPOKéMON in battle.\cLearn about how moves work in DOUBLE BATTLES\nespecially to ensure you may battle effectively.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]POKéMON-catching tips
POKéMON become easier to catch when their HP\nis low.\cThey become even easier to catch if they have\na status problem such as being asleep or\nparalyzed.\cThe type of POKé BALL used may also affect how\neasily POKéMON can be caught.\cTry to match the POKé BALL types to suit the\ntargeted POKéMON.[dialogue_end]

FATEEN: I see the people of PHENAC held\nprisoner.\nThey are enclosed, and their only way out has\nbeen sealed.\cFATEEN: A key.\nYou will need a key to let them out.\nBut easily found it will not be.\nWithout diligence, it will avoid discovery.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Sand.\nSand is all I see and nothing more.\nFrom this, I can divine nothing.\cFATEEN: Perhaps this is the sort of occasion\none calls upon the modern methods of ONBS.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: A giant chunk of iron I see.\nImmense it is, and broad.\nIt is much too big for me to see from one end\nto the other.\cFATEEN: Oh, what have we here?\nI see a small POKéMON cowering in terror inside\nthe iron shell.\cFATEEN: Perhaps you can do something for that\nfrightened POKéMON.\nWill you do that?[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: I sense many eyes watching your every\nmovement.\n...This is not a good sign.\cFATEEN: I see hostility in these eyes.\nThey appear to be waiting patiently for you to\nget careless and alone.\cFATEEN: This is something you can't avoid--it\ncatches up to you one day.\nAll one can do is be ready for the inevitable.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: What you seek...\nIts return will not come soon.\cFATEEN: Do not let this crush you.\nThis is an occasion in which you are being put\nto the test.\cFATEEN: If you overcome this trial, you will\ngrow in power and stature, of that I am certain.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: What you have lost...\nIts recovery is close at hand.\nIt is far to the northeast.\cFATEEN: The one who holds it appears not to\nbe a thoroughly bad sort.\nThere appears to be a good reason on their part\nto hold what you seek.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: I sense anger like flames.\nYour enemy appears to be consumed with\nunwavering rage over you.\cFATEEN: There is so much anger...\nYour enemy is extraordinary.\nThis person must be very powerful.\cFATEEN: Your enemy appears to know you\npersonally.\nPerhaps you have an idea who it may be?[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: A monumental occurrence appears\nto be coming with you at its center.\cFATEEN: You need a ship.\nMake way to a port.\nAll is ready for your arrival.\cFATEEN: What you are about to face...\nIt seems too much for one to bear.\nIt is far beyond me.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: I see you alone making way to\nCITADARK ISLE.\cFATEEN: I see you on a most peculiar vessel\nthat looks like a POKéMON.\nIt seems exhilarating.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: A giant POKéMON I see...\nIt is CIPHER's trump card.\n...Oh, no, this is not good...\cFATEEN: Its heart is tightly shut.\nIt only obeys its master's orders.\cFATEEN: But what this POKéMON really wants...\nIts heart is not in this.\nIt's seeking help.\cFATEEN: Yes, it is under the enemy's control,\nbut you need to understand that it is also\na victim.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: I see the POKéMON you captured.\nIts heart is tightly shut.\cFATEEN: The poor thing...\nImagine what it had to endure before its heart\nretreated into that hard shell.\cFATEEN: Let it be given the time to mingle with\nmany POKéMON.\nWith patience, I'm certain it will open its heart\neventually.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: I see many POKéMON with their hearts\ncold and closed.\nThey still appear to be in ORRE.\cFATEEN: It seems that you are the one capable\nof saving them.\nDo so.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Atop a lighthouse...\n...An immense round thing...\n...\cFATEEN: I can't do this.\nI can't see much more than that.\nThis is something beyond even my sight![dialogue_end]
FATEEN: Those POKéMON with their hearts\nclosed...\nAll of them seem to have gathered to you.\cFATEEN: It doesn't take my power to see that\nit was no easy matter to catch them all.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]
FATEEN: It is a cause to celebrate.\nNo POKéMON remain in ORRE with their hearts\nclosed.\cFATEEN: All that remains is CIPHER's head on\nCITADARK ISLE.\nBut this one will be tenacious.\cFATEEN: Watch that you do not succumb\nto his will.\nFwofwofwo.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: In total, there are nine SETS in the PURIFY\nCHAMBER.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: One SHADOW POKéMON can be placed in the\ncenter of each SET.\nThe SHADOW POKéMON is referred to as the\nVISITOR.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Up to four regular POKéMON can be placed\naround the VISITOR.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Depending on the number and kinds of regular\nPOKéMON, and how they are positioned, the\npace of purification will be affected.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should try different combinations and see\nfor yourself what works best.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The speed at which a SHADOW\nPOKéMON is purified is referred to as "FLOW."\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In order to heighten FLOW, it's necessary to\nboost the TEMPO of the SET.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: One other thing: the direction in which the\nVISITOR in the center is facing is also important.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For the best FLOW, the SHADOW POKéMON\nshould be facing a regular POKéMON type\nagainst which its attacks would be \n"super effective."[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The type matchups among the regular\nPOKéMON surrounding the SHADOW POKéMON\ndetermine the "TEMPO" of that SET.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A SET with high TEMPO is the key to\npurifying SHADOW POKéMON efficiently.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: To make a SET with good TEMPO, the\nimportant thing is to place as many regular\nPOKéMON as possible.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As mentioned, type matchups among the\nregular POKéMON are also important.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The regular POKéMON should form a ring\nin which each POKéMON has a type advantage to\nthe one next to it in one direction.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: A different POKéMON has been brought from\nthe PC Storage System.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This POKéMON can exchange places with the\nPOKéMON placed on the SET.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The newly selected POKéMON can also be\nplaced on a different spot on the SET.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Repeat this process and optimize the SET for\npurification.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Depending on how the POKéMON are placed\non the SET, the TEMPO of purification--indicated\nat the left of the screen--changes.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The cursor will be moved so that you may see\nhow much of a difference can be made in the\nTEMPO.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It should be obvious that placing this\nPOKéMON on the right side provides better\nTEMPO for purification than if it were on\nthe left.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In such a way, the type matchups of\nPOKéMON affect the TEMPO.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The levels of matchups are indicated using\nthe thickness and colors of the lines joining the\nPOKéMON.\nThe thicker and lighter a blue, the better.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Try placing your POKéMON to find the best\nmatchups possible.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: On one SET, up to four regular POKéMON may\nbe placed.\nLet's place the fourth POKéMON on this SET.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It should be obvious that it is best to have as\nmany regular POKéMON as possible on each SET.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: As you can see, the TEMPO for this SET is at\nthe highest level.\nThis is referred to as a "BEST CIRCLE."\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Next, let's place a SHADOW POKéMON in this\nBEST CIRCLE.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A SHADOW POKéMON can only be placed in\nthe center of a SET.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's place one now.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When the SHADOW POKéMON is placed, the\npurification FLOW is indicated.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: FLOW indicates the speed of purification.\nThe higher the FLOW, the faster the purification.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: FLOW is dependent on the SET's TEMPO and\nthe direction in which the SHADOW POKéMON is\nfacing.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Try changing the SHADOW\nPOKéMON's direction.\nIf its type matches up favorably, the line between\nthe POKéMON will thicken and change in color.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: To change the SHADOW POKéMON's\ndirection, choose "ROTATE" on the menu.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If the cursor is yellow, however, the menu will\nnot open.\nPress the X Button and make the cursor white to\nopen the menu.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When the SHADOW POKéMON's direction is\nchanged, the matchup line shifts accordingly.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The key point to remember is that the\nPOKéMON should be grouped and placed for the\nbest type matchups.\nPlease experiment for the best results.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Before I finish, I should tell you that you will\nbe automatically informed if a SHADOW POKéMON\nin the PURIFY CHAMBER is ready for the\npurification ceremony.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: When you receive that word,\n[Player], please return here and open the\nPOKéMON's heart for good.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That concludes my guided tour of the\nPURIFICATION CHAMBER's edit screen.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I hope everything is clear to you.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: TEAM SNAGEM's HIDEOUT\nis around here somewhere.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: It's a big, weird house\nsoutheast of here.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I think this POKé SPOT\nwas the destination.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: That's right.\nAround there.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you go way off to the\nnortheast, there's a POKé SPOT that's\nhard to find since it's inside a cave.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, Boss!\nMIROR B., sir!\nThat uppity brat we met before!\nHe's over there![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, my boys, isn't that pathetic?\nSurely, you two aren't spooked by this little boy?\nHow very, very bad is that?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You're [Player], is that it?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't want to disappoint you or\nanything, but I don't have mercy for anyone in\nour way.\nNot even little children!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the music play![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, I took you for granted!\nJust a boy, I thought to myself!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You two![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: This is where we all say, "Let's go,\nescape!"[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh dear, not you again.\nLet me guess, you're my fan?\nI can understand that, but I really can't abide \na stalker!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, if you really insist, I would be\nhappy to give you my autograph in exchange for\nall your POKéMON.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, you!\nI'm quite offended that you would beat me.\nWhat kind of a fan are you, anyway?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This time, I'll overlook it.\nBut I won't let you off if it ever happens again!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay!\nLet's go!\nEscape![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What do you think you're doing\nhere?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If our boss comes along, there're\ngoing to be consequences, right?\nSo you move right along and get lost.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Who?\nOur boss, MIROR B.?\nHe's not here yet.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The boss goes off on his own to do\nhis own thing without us.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And so, we end up sitting around\nwaiting with sweet nothing to do.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Fuhohoho!\nWe meet yet again!\nWhat perfect timing!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Perhaps we're tied by some bond\nI don't know about.\nBut you still cause me so much distress!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: For me to get all the POKéMON in\nthe world, you're an impudent impediment!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: And so...\nLet the music start![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how dare you!\nI say, how dare you!\nDon't you dare think that this is where it ends!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Next time, I'll put things right\nand lay down my elegant steps!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let's go!\nEscape![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, no! You again!\nYour timing is terrible as ever!\nWhy show up now of all times?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Our boss MIROR B. is performing\na dance to summon POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I'm saying this for everyone's\nsake, get out of here quietly.\nLike, real quiet.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh-uh-uh!\nMusic, stop![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Trouble!\nYou've been spotted![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Sniff, sniff...\nUh-huh!\nI smell the alluring aroma of POKéMON, oh yes,\nI do!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: My summoning dance has\nbrought some POKéMON here!\nFuhohohoh!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: I can tell you've got some very\ncute POKéMON with you.\nWell, they'll all soon be mine!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the music play![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Aww, no!\nWhy'd you have to win?!\nNow our boss is going to be in the worst mood!\nWay to go![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, how dare you!\nBut you're hugely mistaken if you really think\nthat this is where it ends!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: One of these days, I'll put things\nright and lay down my elegant steps!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Until then...\nLet's go!\nEscape![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, moan...\nI'm starving...\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You know how there're always\nsome POKé SNACKS left over there?\n...I wonder if they're okay for people to eat.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: ...What?\nI only asked.\nI'm not about to really eat any![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Ever since we dropped the MIROR\nRADAR, it's not been easy keeping tabs on\nour boss's whereabouts.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: This better be the place we're\nreally supposed to meet him.\nWe're in deep trouble if we've got it wrong.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, my!\nYour timing is impeccable!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You two!\nI'll give you a little demonstration on what makes\nmy steps so elegant.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Let the music start![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Stop the music!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You silly boy!\nIn this situation, you should know that you need\nto match rhythms with me!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's all your fault that you've\nthrown my timing out of whack!\nOh, you annoying child!\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: You two!\nLet's go!\nEscape!\nDon't fall behind![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Stop the music!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Well, well, well!\nIf it isn't the ultra-uncool boy who always,\nalways, always messes up my plans![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boss!\nUse your world's-best dance steps and punish\nthe pest![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, what a swell idea!\nLet's try that right away!\nLet the music start![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Humph!\nMy groove was just a little off today.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't even think that you've\nbested me yet, you silly boy!\nFuhohohoh!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Okay, you two!\nLet's go!\nEscape![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: I wish our boss, MIROR B., would \nget here already.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I wonder what he has in mind?\nI mean, why would he call us out to this dank\nand gloomy place anyway?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Boss!\nMIROR B., sir!\nIf you're here, can you come out of hiding?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: What the...?\nNot you again!\nWhy do you keep after us like this?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Uh...\nAre we maybe like celebrities?[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our boss, MIROR B., dances the\ndays and nights away.\nHe won't quit until he gets all the POKéMON in\nthe world.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Huh?\nWhat does dancing have to do with POKéMON?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That doesn't matter!\nWhat I'm trying to say is that our objective is to\nget every POKéMON in the world![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Oh, Boss!\nPlease, someone let him win this challenge!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Rather than roughing it outside\nyet again, I'd really love to sleep in a bed for\na change...[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Our boss, MIROR B., is over at the\nCOLOSSEUM.\nHe says he's going to gut it out until he wins\na challenge.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: I don't know, though.\nI have a feeling he'll give up and come out\nsoon.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The boss is at the COLOSSEUM.\nWhy?\nBecause loads of POKéMON gather here.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Hehehe.\nIt makes it easier for us to do our jobs.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Wait a second...\nAre you thinking about making a COLOSSEUM\nchallenge?\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Don't do it.\nIt's not worth your time.\nOur MIROR B. is in there now.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you want to win a challenge,\nnext time'd be better.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A place this glittery and bright...\nIt doesn't feel right for a guy like me.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: It's the right place for our boss,\nMIROR B.\nHe's right at home in a glitzy place like this.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Darn it!\nThe POKéMON on BATTLE CDs aren't real!\c[bubble_or_speaker]: We couldn't swipe them if we\ntried![dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: Welcome to BATTLE BINGO!\nHow may I serve you today?
[bubble_or_speaker]: Thank you.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: These CARDS are available for play right\nnow.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]What is BATTLE BINGO?
[bubble_or_speaker]: BATTLE BINGO is a strategy game that is\nplayed on a BINGO CARD with 16 PANELS\narranged in a 4-by-4 grid.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The 16 PANELS are turned over and exposed\none by one.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Flip over PANELS to form a vertical,\nhorizontal, or diagonal line to score a BINGO.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Keep forming BINGO lines until all PANELS are\nflipped over or you run out of moves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If all PANELS are flipped over, 10 BINGO lines\nwill be completed, and you win the game.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]How do I play?
[bubble_or_speaker]: At the start of a game, you will have one\nPOKéMON and two MASTER BALLS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Your POKéMON will also have ENTRY\nPOINTS (EP).\nTo flip over a PANEL, 1 EP is required.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If all your POKéMON use up their EP, no more\nPANELS can be flipped over.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: At that point, it's game over for you.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]How do I choose PANELS?
[bubble_or_speaker]: On the first turn, you may select any 1 of the\n16 PANELS and flip it over.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The next PANEL that can be flipped must be\nnext to an already-flipped-over PANEL.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Think ahead and plan the sequence for\nflipping PANELS.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]What happens when a PANEL is flipped?
[bubble_or_speaker]: There are two kinds of PANELS.\nOne kind is marked with a POKéMON type and\nthe other with a question mark.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you try to flip a PANEL marked with a\nPOKéMON type, a hidden POKéMON will appear.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You must battle this POKéMON with the\nPOKéMON you entered in the game.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The battle will be a strictly one-on-one match\nwith no switching of POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you win the battle or catch the opposing\nPOKéMON with a MASTER BALL, the contested\nPANEL can be flipped over.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If the opposing POKéMON is caught, you may\nchoose it as your own for PANEL battles from\nthe next PANEL on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The "?" PANELS can be opened just by using\n1 EP.\nThey hide EP and MASTER BALLS for the\nplayer's use.[dialogue_end]
[unknown2_07_1]What happens when I get a BINGO?
[bubble_or_speaker]: If you complete a line of flipped-over\nPANELS, you score a BINGO.\nYou are awarded a single EP for each BINGO\nline.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you quit the game before the end, you are\ngiven POKé COUPONS matched to the number of\nBINGO lines you made.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you complete the CARD, you are awarded\na bonus for leftover EP and MASTER BALLS in\naddition to the regular prize.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If all your POKéMON run out of EP, it's game\nover since you will no longer be able to flip\nPANELS.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In that case, you will not be given any POKé\nCOUPONS that you may have earned in\nthat game.\nPlease be aware of that.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: If a POKéMON gets a burn, it steadily loses \nHP during the battle.\nIt's best to heal it as soon as possible.[dialogue_end]

[bubble_or_speaker]: ELECTRIC-type POKéMON are strong against\nWATER-type POKéMON, but are weak against\nGROUND-type POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Think about what a GROUND-type POKéMON\nwould be weak against.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The MAGNEMITE is an ELECTRIC type, so it's\nstrong against the WATER-type GOLDEEN, but\nweak against the GROUND-type SANDSHREW.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, the GRASS-type TANGELA is strong\nagainst the GROUND type, so it was able to\ndefeat the SANDSHREW.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Learn how POKéMON and move types match\nup to gain the upper hand in battle.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: In a DOUBLE BATTLE, a move that hits both\nof your opponent's POKéMON is very useful.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: But, be careful.\nThere are some moves that also hit the POKéMON\nin your party, too.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: SURF is a move that hits both of the \nopponent's POKéMON in a DOUBLE BATTLE.\nEARTHQUAKE, on the other hand, is an attack\nthat hits all POKéMON except the one using it.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Some moves even hit the POKéMON that used\nit in the first place.\nThat's why you need to be careful when using\ncertain moves.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A POKéMON of a single type may have a type\nweakness, but a dual-type POKéMON may not \nhave that same type weakness.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: On the other hand, a dual-type POKéMON may\nhave even more type disadvantages than \na single-type POKéMON.\nKnowing the difference is the key to victory.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For example, a WOOPER is a dual-type\nPOKéMON that is of the WATER and GROUND\ntypes.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If it is attacked by an ELECTRIC-type move,\nwhich is strong against WATER-type POKéMON,\nthe fact that it is also a GROUND type makes\nthat attack completely ineffective.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: On the other hand, a GRASS-type attack,\nwhich is strong against both the WATER and\nGROUND types, would be devastating against\na WOOPER.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: If the opposing POKéMON has a type \nadvantage over yours, one tactic is to switch it\nout of the battle and switch in a POKéMON held\nin reserve.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: You should have POKéMON of different types\nso that you can flexibly respond to whatever\ntype of POKéMON the opponent deploys.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When a PIDGEY and a PIKACHU battle, the \nFLYING-type PIDGEY is at a clear disadvantage\nbecause of its type.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: In this situation, the PIDGEY should be\nswitched out and replaced by the GROUND-type\nGEODUDE, which has a type advantage.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Many kinds of abilities provide an edge in\nbattle.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: That's why you absolutely have to confirm\nwhat abilities your POKéMON have.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The ability LEVITATE completely protects\nthe POKéMON from being hit by any GROUND-\ntype attack.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: So, a POKéMON that's weak to GROUND-type\nattacks won't take any damage if it has the\nLEVITATE ability.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A POKéMON can hold one item and use it\nduring a battle to restore HP, raise stats, \nand so on.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The holding POKéMON will use the item\nautomatically when needed, so it is very\nconvenient.\nNot all items can be used by POKéMON, however.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The SITRUS BERRY held by the TAILLOW\nautomatically restores 30 HP if the POKéMON's\nHP drops to half or less.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There are many other kinds of items that can\nbe used by POKéMON during battle.\nMake your POKéMON hold them and check what\nhappens.\c
[bubble_or_speaker]: Certain moves cause status problems, such\nas confusion or a burn, in targets.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: If you're facing a tough POKéMON that's hard\nto knock out, try using a move that enfeebles it\nwith a status problem.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For example, CONFUSE RAY causes\nconfusion.\nWILL-O-WISP causes a burn.\nThese moves will give you an advantage.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: There are other enfeebling moves that cause\nstatus problems.\nBe sure you learn about them.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: There are moves that can boost the stats of\nyour POKéMON.\nThere are also moves that lower the stats of the\nopposing POKéMON.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Try using moves that affect POKéMON stats\non a tough opponent.\nYou may get an easy victory out of it![dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: By changing the stats of POKéMON in battle,\nyou can really change the amount of damage\ninflicted and taken.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Stat-changing moves are very useful when\nyou're up against tough opponents.\nYou should learn how they can help you.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: The weather can affect the power and/or the\nbehavior of certain moves.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: A move that is somewhat tricky to use can\nbecome extremely powerful if the weather\ncondition is changed in its favor.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: For example, the move SOLARBEAM normally\nrequires a turn to charge up before firing on the\nsecond turn.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: However, if the move SUNNY DAY has been\nused, SOLARBEAM can fire every turn.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: Learn how certain moves work together to\ncreate powerful combinations.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: A DOUBLE BATTLE combo is one that\ninvolves both the POKéMON in battle, obviously.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: By having two POKéMON work as a duo, even\ntough opponents can be defeated.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: When one POKéMON uses the move HELPING\nHAND, its partner's attack move is made even\nmore powerful.\c[bubble_or_speaker]: The HELPING HAND combo is one of the most\nbasic DOUBLE BATTLE combos.\nYou definitely should know it.[dialogue_end]
[bubble_or_speaker]: Now you're all set for a real battle![dialogue_end]
