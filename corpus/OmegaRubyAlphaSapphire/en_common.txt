Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight.\nThere is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun’s rays,\nthe seed grows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight,\nIvysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong.\nIf it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight,\nit’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on Venusaur’s back. The flower is said\nto take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight.\nThe flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication\nof its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander\nis enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged,\nthe flame burns fiercely.
Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp\nclaws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive.\nIn this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with\na bluish white color.
Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents.\nIt breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything.\nHowever, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent\nweaker than itself.
Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection.\nThe shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its\nsurface help minimize resistance in water,\nenabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail\nbecomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages.\nThe scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s\ntoughness as a battler.
Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell.\nThe water spouts are very accurate.\nThey can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy\nto strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.
Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves\nbigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna,\nthis Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this Pokémon’s body is as hard as an\niron slab. Metapod does not move very much.\nIt stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for\nevolution inside the hard shell.
Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey\nfrom flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey\nfrom flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable\nof distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it\ndislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree.\nHowever, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares\nfor its coming evolution.\nThis is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach\nits nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack\nin a furious swarm.
Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction.\nIt is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest,\nhowever far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.
Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This\nPokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory\nis violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe\nwith its sharp claws.
This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully\nglossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the\nstriking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling\nthem to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.
Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep,\nit constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not\npicky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.
Raticate’s sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them\nground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may\neven chew on the walls of houses.
Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over\nhalf a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all\naround, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.
Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak.\nThey are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or\nwater. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.
Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this\nposition allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any\ndirection with a glare from its upraised head.
This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things\nwith its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok\nwraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace\nis impossible.
This Pokémon has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks.\nThese appear to become electrically charged during the night\nwhile Pikachu sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity\nwhen it is dozy after waking up.
This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over\nits body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness.\nRaichu plants its tail in the ground to discharge electricity.
Sandshrew has a very dry hide that is extremely tough.\nThe Pokémon can roll into a ball that repels any attack.\nAt night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep.
Sandslash can roll up its body as if it were a ball covered\nwith large spikes. In battle, this Pokémon will try to make\nthe foe flinch by jabbing it with its spines. It then leaps at\nthe stunned foe to tear wildly with its sharp claws.
Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison.\nThey are thought to have developed as protection for\nthis small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases\na horrible toxin from its horn.
When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep\ntheir barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other.\nThis Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated\nfrom the others.
Nidoqueen’s body is encased in extremely hard scales.\nIt is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This\nPokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.
Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks\nto them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even\nthe slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice.
Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses\na hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once,\nand it challenges the foe with all its might.
Nidoking’s thick tail packs enormously destructive power.\nWith one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once\nthis Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.
On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon\ncome out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy\nreturn to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep\nnestled up against each other.
Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using\nits wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water.\nIt is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.
Inside Vulpix’s body burns a flame that never goes out.\nDuring the daytime, when the temperatures rise, this\nPokémon releases flames from its mouth to prevent its\nbody from growing too hot.
Legend has it that Ninetales came into being when\nnine wizards possessing sacred powers merged into one.\nThis Pokémon is highly intelligent—it can understand\nhuman speech.
When this Pokémon sings, it never pauses to breathe.\nIf it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily\nfall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life.
Wigglytuff’s body is very flexible. By inhaling deeply,\nthis Pokémon can inflate itself seemingly without end.\nOnce inflated, Wigglytuff bounces along lightly like a balloon.
Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become\nunhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under\nthe eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.
Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks\nthe victim’s blood. It becomes active on inky dark\nmoonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon.
Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself.\nDuring the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon’s feet\nare thought to change shape and become similar to the roots\nof trees.
From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely\nhorrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the\nnoxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey.
Vileplume has the world’s largest petals. They are used to\nattract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the\nprey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them.
Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called\ntochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this\nBug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine\nfor extending life.
Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain\nnutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested\ntree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.
Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair\nthat covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large\neyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.
Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes\nactive at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather\naround streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.
Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple—\nwherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled\nfor planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing\ndelicious vegetables.
Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body.\nAs a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two\ntriplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak\nabout without making any incriminating footsteps. For some\nreason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.
Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness.\nThe whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the\nPokémon’s surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed\nby the whiskers.
If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can’t remember\nhaving done so. It apparently can’t form a memory of such\nan event because it goes into an altered state that is much\nlike deep sleep.
Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims\neffortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues\npeople from wrecked ships floundering in high seas.
When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns\nrough, it’s a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However,\nbecause it goes into a towering rage almost instantly,\nit is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation\nis boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger.\nHowever, it also becomes much less intelligent at the\nsame time.
Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything,\nthis Pokémon won’t forget the scent, no matter what. It uses\nits advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of\nother living things.
Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable\nof running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The\nfire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon’s body is its source\nof power.
Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the\nPokémon’s spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its\nthinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp\nfangs bounce right off it.
The surface of Poliwhirl’s body is always wet and slick with\na slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily\nslip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.
Poliwrath’s highly developed, brawny muscles never grow\nfatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong,\nthis Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean\nwithout effort.
Abra needs to sleep for eighteen hours a day. If it doesn’t,\nthis Pokémon loses its ability to use telekinetic powers. If it is\nattacked, Abra escapes using Teleport while it is still sleeping.
Kadabra holds a silver spoon in its hand. The spoon is used\nto amplify the alpha waves in its brain. Without the spoon, the\nPokémon is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its\ntelekinetic powers.
Alakazam’s brain continually grows, infinitely multiplying\nbrain cells. This amazing brain gives this Pokémon an\nastoundingly high IQ of 5,000. It has a thorough memory\nof everything that has occurred in the world.

Their poison is strong enough to eat through\nthe hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately\nat anything that enters their territory.
They knock down flying prey by firing\ncompressed water from their massive\nclaws like shooting a pistol.
Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of\nwater powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls.
They make their home in deserts. They can\ngenerate their energy from basking in the sun,\nso eating food is not a requirement.
They flare their frills and generate energy.\nA single Heliolisk can generate sufficient\nelectricity to power a skyscraper.
This Pokémon was restored from a fossil.\nIf something happens that it doesn’t like,\nit throws a tantrum and runs wild.
Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred\nthick metal plates as if they were paper, it was\ninvincible in the ancient world it once inhabited.
This ancient Pokémon was restored\nfrom part of its body that had been\nfrozen in ice for over 100 million years.
The diamond-shaped crystals on its body\nexpel air as cold as -240 degrees Fahrenheit,\nsurrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice.
It sends a soothing aura from its\nribbonlike feelers to calm fights.
Although its body is small, its proficient\nfighting skills enable it to keep up with\nbig bruisers like Machamp and Hariyama.
Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and\nreceiving electrical waves, it can communicate\nwith others over vast distances.
Born from the temperatures and pressures\ndeep underground, it fires beams from the\nstone in its head.
The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon,\nit lives in damp, shady places, so its\nbody doesn’t dry out.
It drives away opponents by excreting a\nsticky liquid that can dissolve anything.\nIts eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything.
This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon\nwill hug its beloved Trainer, leaving\nthat Trainer covered in sticky slime.
These key collectors threaten any attackers\nby fiercely jingling their keys at them.
These Pokémon are created when\nspirits possess rotten tree stumps.\nThey prefer to live in abandoned forests.
It can control trees at will. It will trap people\nwho harm the forest, so they can never leave.
The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit\ntrapped in this world. As the sun sets,\nit becomes restless and active.
Singing in eerie voices, they wander\ntown streets on the night of the new moon.\nAnyone who hears their song is cursed.

Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel.\nIts cumbersome frame crushes anything that\nstands in its way.
They live in pitch-black caves. Their enormous ears\ncan emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz.
They fly around on moonless nights\nand attack careless prey. Nothing can\nbeat them in a battle in the dark.
Legends say it can share eternal life.\nIt slept for a thousand years in the form\nof a tree before its revival.
When this legendary Pokémon’s wings and\ntail feathers spread wide and glow red,\nit absorbs the life force of living creatures.
When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into\ndisarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.
A sudden transformation of Carbink,\nits pink, glimmering body is said to be\nthe loveliest sight in the whole world.
In its true form, it possess a huge amount of power.\nLegends of its avarice tell how it once carried off\nan entire castle to gain the treasure hidden within.

Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nAfter Kricketot evolved, it became\nstronger as Kricketune.\c\nWe also got other Pokémon, so we could\ngo farther and farther from home.\c\nBut where is my beloved Gym Leader?\nWhere is that city he said he’s from?\c\nI do have the Town Map, but maps\nbaffle me.\c\nIt doesn’t matter, though.\nIf we keep moving, we’ll get somewhere.\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode six!\c\n“How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms\nCan’t Be Found Everywhere!”\c\nThe more lost you are, the less useful\na map becomes! You know it’s true!\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nOur journey was long, and it was hard.\nBut no one wants to hear that!\c\nSo, I finally found my Gym Leader.\nBut he has an incurable disease!\c\nHe begged me, out of the blue, with his\nlast wish.\c\nHe asked for my Pokémon!\nBut my Kricketune’s my partner!\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode seven!\c\n“My Trail of Footprints Shortened\nthe Distance Between Us!”\c\nEvery time I see Kricketune’s face, I\nam reminded of our time together...\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nMy beloved Gym Leader, whom I\nfought so hard to meet, was a fraud!\c\nHow dare he con this pure maiden!\nHow dare he toy with my emotions!\c\nBut whose fault was it?\nWas it mine for being taken in?\c\nAll I know is that my tears overflow,\nand despair is my world...\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode eight!\c\n“Kricketune and I! Our Bond Is True!”\c\nThat Gym Leader’s eating a Giga Impact\nfor playing me for a fool!\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nHaving defeated the fake Gym Leader,\nKricketune and I stood in a daze.\c\nWe were spent. Drained by a romance\nthat ended in a nightmare.\c\nIt was then that my childhood friend, the\nformer Bug Catcher, arrived.\c\nHe did more than that.\nHe confessed his love to me!\c\n“I wanted to become an Elite Four\nmember, so I quit as a Gym Leader.\c\nBut then that faker appeared.\nYou took care of him, though!”\c\nWait, ex-Bug Catcher! What?\nWhat are you saying?!\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” final episode!\c\n“Do it, Kricketune! Silver Wind over\nSinnoh Skies!”\c\nYou were laughing at me for falling for\nthat fraud, weren’t you?\c\n...

If you have Pokémon with you, then\nyou’re an official Pokémon Trainer!\r\nYou can’t say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost...\nI should have trained mine more...
Listen, you. If you’re strong, you\nshould have told me from the start!
Ever since I lost to you, I’ve\ntrained my Pokémon like crazy.\r\nYou can’t say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost...\nIs my training method not right?
If you’re going to get stronger, I’ll\nget stronger, too.
I got stronger, too, thanks to you!\nTake this as a sign of my gratitude!
Haha! Our eyes met!\nI’ll take you on with my Bug Pokémon!
Ow! Down and out!
If you lock eyes with a Trainer,\nyou have to challenge! It’s a rule!
I caught a whole bunch of Pokémon!\c\nGo, go, go!\nMy Bug Pokémon team!
I have all these Pokémon, but I\ncouldn’t win...
I caught a bunch of Pokémon.\nNow I’m out of Poké Balls.
I’m going to keep winning and aim\nto be the best Trainer.\c\nHelp me further my career!
I ended up furthering your career...
To keep winning my way up, I see that\nI have to catch more Pokémon.
Did you feel the tug of our soul-\nsoothing fragrance?
You weren’t led astray by our aroma...
Aromatherapy can heal your mind and body.
I’m Amy, and this is my twin sister, Liv!\nWe’re gonna fight you together!
The two of us fight together as one!
Amy: We lost...\nLiv: We lost, Sis...
Taking on two opponents really makes you think!
My sister and I are the perfect team,\nbut we still lost!
What?! You only have one Pokémon!\nYou can’t battle us like that!
If you want to battle us,\nyou need two Pokémon!\c\nYou’ll be no match for us otherwise!
Gah! My fishing line’s all snarled up!\nI’m getting frustrated!\r\nThat’s it! Battle me!
Gah! Lost it!\nI’m even more annoyed now!
Gah, I’m still boiling mad...\nGrrrrr...
Why keep it a secret?\nI’m the Water-Pokémon expert!\c\nHuh?\nYou don’t know me?
I thought I wasn’t too bad, if I may\nsay so, but I guess not... Bleah...
I got so into fishing that\nI forgot I had to raise my Pokémon...
If we were fishing, you wouldn’t stand\na chance against me.\r\nSo, bring on your Pokémon!
If we were fishing, I would’ve won...
I think I’ll try my luck at landing\na big one at Meteor Falls.\c\nThere has to be something in there.\nI just know it.
Leaving footprints in the sand is\nso fun!
Waah! I got sand in my runners!\nThey’re all gritty!
I want to leave my footprints in the sand\neverywhere, but they disappear quickly...
Should I...\nOr shouldn’t I?\c\nOK, sure, I will battle!
Maybe I shouldn’t have battled...
If you’re faced with a decision and you\nlet someone else choose for you,\r\nyou will regret it—however things turn out.
Come on, battle with me!
Ohh...\nI thought I could win...
I made the decision to battle, so I\ncan accept this loss in grace.\c\nI am still upset about losing, though!
I’m disappointed, but I have to thank\nyou for that battle! Here, take this!
We learn all sorts of things at the\nTrainers’ School.\c\nI want to test things out for real!
I slacked off in school...\nThat’s why I lost.
I’ll have to redo some courses at the\nTrainers’ School.\r\nIf I don’t, Roxanne will be steamed.
I’ve been studying seriously at the\nTrainers’ School.\r\nI won’t lose like I did last time.
Hunh?\nI studied diligently.
I’ll have to redo some courses at the\nTrainers’ School.\r\nIf I don’t, Roxanne will be steamed.
I’ll give you this, so don’t tell\nRoxanne that I lost, OK?
I study at school, and I study on the\nway home, too!
I’m in shock—I lost?
Awww, I’ll never become an elegant\nTrainer like Roxanne this way!
I studied a whole lot since I saw you.\nYou must see my achievements!
I’m in shock! I lost again?
Have you beaten Roxanne?\nThen I won’t be able to beat you now.
I’m quite shocked, but also motivated.\nIf you’d like, please use this.
[~ 77]
Y-you’re crazy strong!
[~ 79]
Whoa! Stay away from me! Get away!
I was knocked out. Out like a light!
Huh? You aren’t with that girl who\nuses Dragon types?! Oh man...\r\nI feel silly for being scared.
If you can’t beat me, you won’t stand\na chance against Roxanne!
Wow! You’ve got some potential!
Roxanne is several times stronger than me.\c\nYou’d better be on your guard!
My Pokémon and I rule!\nCheck us out!
Ouch! A scrape!\nI have to put on a bandage!
Bandages are signs of toughness!\nI’ve got another one!
My Bug Pokémon are tough!\nLet’s battle!
I lost!\nI thought I had you!
Bug Pokémon evolve quickly,\nso they get strong quickly, too.
Let me teach you how strong my\nadorable Pokémon is!
You’re a notch above me...
Pokémon that possess cuteness and\npower, that’s ideal, I think.
Whew! I was worried that a kid was\ndrowning when I saw you.\c\nYou seem to be OK, so what do you\nsay to a battle?
Glub... Glub...
You’re so strong for your age!\nHow wonderful!\c\nWhen you get a little older, why don’t\nyou try being a lifeguard with me?
Swimming the deep blue sea...\nIt’s the greatest feeling!
I lost...\nNow I’m feeling blue...
Why is the sea blue?\c\nI learned about that at the museum in\nSlateport, but I totally forgot.
My body feels lighter in the water.\nIt’s like I’ve gotten slimmer!
I’m floating...
Your body weight is reduced to just\none tenth in the water.\c\nThat would make me...\nWhoops! I’m not telling you my weight!
The blue, blue sky...\nThe vast sea...\r\nIt’s so peaceful...
I lost while I was lounging!
I want to be told I’m relaxing to be\nwith. Giggle.
Hahaha! I’m a lousy runner, but in\nthe water you can’t catch me!
I give up!
I wouldn’t lose in a swim race...
The sea is my backyard. I’m not going\nto take it easy because you’re a kid!
Did you take it easy on me by any\nchance?
Drifting along with the waves...\nI love it! Why don’t you give it a try?
Which do you prefer, fishing in the\nsea or a stream?
Like in deep-sea fishing, I lost\nspectacularly!
Fishing is the greatest, whether it’s\nin the sea or in a stream.\r\nYou agree with me, right?
I caught a bunch of Pokémon by fishing.\nI’ll show you an impressive battle!
I lost spectacularly again!
Win or lose, Pokémon are the greatest!\nYou agree with me, right?
Time for a lavish banquet!
What do people do if they need to go\ntake a break?\c\nWhat if my rod hooks a big one while\nI’m in the washroom? I just can’t leave...
I lost because I’m trying to not go\nto the washroom...
Oh, no! I’ve got this feeling I’ll hook\na big one!
My electric soul, it’ll shatter your\ndreams whole, whoa-yeah!
That was plugged in, amped up,\noverdriven electric, man!
Pokémon and rock, it’s all about heart,\nwhoa yeah!
I trained under Wattson!\nThere ain’t no way I’d lose easily!
Unplugged and turned off...
Wattson, our Gym Leader, has been\naround for a long, long time.\c\nHe was battling even before your\ndaddy was born, that tough coot.
Yawn...\c\nI must have drifted off to sleep while\nI was drifting in the waves.
Ahaha, I lost...\nI’ll take a snooze, I think...
Floating and being rocked by the waves—\nit’s like sleeping in a plush, comfy bed.
The sea is like my backyard.\nLet’s battle!
I lost on my home field...\nI’m in shock!
I swim the seas with a heart full of\ndreams...\c\nIt’s a song!\nAnyways, I’m gonna swim some more!
Swimming in the vast, deep sea, my\nPokémon has grown a lot stronger!
What a shock!\c\nMy Pokémon has gotten stronger, but\nI stayed weak as a Trainer!
What you learn in battle makes you a\nstronger Trainer.\r\nThe waves taught me that.
I lost, so I guess I have no choice!\nI’ll go ahead and give this to you!
Do you know a little town called\nDewford?
I hate this!
A weird saying is getting really\ntrendy at Dewford Hall.
Did you want to battle me?\nSure, I’ll go up against you!
I was no match for you.
I think you’re going to keep getting\nbetter. I’ll go for it, too!
My dream is to swim the world’s seven\nseas!
I won’t be able to swim the seven seas\nlike this...
Playing with marine Pokémon is one of\nthe pleasures of swimming!
Ahoy, there! Are you going out to\nSea Mauville, too?
I might not make it...
Sea Mauville is like a hidden tourist spot around here.
My liar of a boyfriend told me that\nI look great in a bikini...
Oh, boo!
Even if it’s a lie, I love being told\nI look great...\r\nWe girls are so complex...
I love the sea!\nI forget all my worries when I swim!
When I lose a battle, I get all\nstressed out!
Work off your stress by swimming!\nIt’s so healthy!
Hiyah! Look at my chiseled abs!\nThis is what you call “cut”!
Aiyah!\nFlubbed out!
Hiyah!\c\nMy sculpted abs have nothing to do\nwith Pokémon battles!
Are you properly protected against\nthe sun?
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
My cheeks are the most prone to burning!
I’ve laid anchor in ports around the\nworld, but Slateport’s the best.
You’re the best!
In the best port was the best\nTrainer...
Urrrrppp...\nBattle? With me?
Urp... Ooooooohhhhhh...\nUrrrrpppp...
I’m usually stronger than this!\nI’m just seasick as a dog!\c\nI am a Sailor, though...
Doesn’t a beach umbrella look like\na giant flower?
Mommy!
If you look at the beach from the sky,\nit looks like a big flower garden!
I’m not losing to you again!\nThat’s why I have my inner tube!
Mommy!
When I have an inner tube, me and my\nPokémon’s cuteness goes way up!
I won’t give you my tube,\nbut I’ll give you this!
Whoa! Watch it!\nI guess you’re not used to Bike racing.
Whoa!\nMy brakes failed!
Flat tires and brake problems can\ncause serious injury!\r\nInspect your Bike for problems!
Yo, you!\nCan you keep up with my speed?
Crash and burn!
Speed alone won’t let me win Pokémon battles.\nI need to reconsider this...

Could I see your Pokémon?\nJust one look, please?
I wanted to complete my collection.
When I see a Pokémon that I don’t know,\nmy passion as a collector is ignited!
Hi, have you caught any new Pokémon?\c\nCould I see your Pokémon?\nJust one look, please?
Your Pokémon...\nI envy you.
I long to make all rare Pokémon mine!
I lost, so it can’t be helped. I’ll give you this\nfrom my collection that I’m so proud of.
Hey!\nDon’t sneak up behind me when I’m fishing!
I lost!\nDrat!
Fishing is all about concentration.\nYou have to focus on the bobber.
I’m Amy!\nThis is my sister, Liv!\r\nWe battle together!
The two of us fight together as one!
Amy: I’m disappointed...\nWe weren’t able to win...\r\nLiv: We lost again, Sis...
Taking on two opponents really makes you think!
My sister and I are the perfect team...\nHow could we lose again?
What?! You have only one Pokémon!\nYou can’t battle us like that!
If you want to battle us,\nyou need two Pokémon!\c\nYou’ll be no match for us otherwise!
Might is right!\nCome on!
Not enough power...
Your skill overcame my strength!\nYour technique is commendable!
You’re a Pokémon Trainer.\nNo need for words. We battle now.
...
It was I who challenged you, and yet\nI lost. I am deeply shamed...
I contemplate Pokémon 24 hours a day.\nHow could you possibly beat me?
I lose.\nI will concede defeat.
Urggh...\nYou’re a Pokémon fanatic, aren’t you?\c\nYou must contemplate Pokémon 24 hours\na day, right?
There’s no need for Brawly to be\ninvolved!\c\nI’ll crush you!
But... How?\nHow could I lose so easily?
I’m not going to waste this loss.\nI’ll use it to motivate me to train!\c\nOne day, I’ll become a Gym Leader...\c\nNo, I’ll become the Pokémon League\nChampion!
Don’t you dare brush me off!\nIt’s not my fault if you cry!
Waaaaaaah!\nI lost!
A long time ago at Dewford Gym,\nit was always dark inside.\c\nWe trained our minds by\npracticing in the dark!

[~ 239]

My passionate love for my\nBike has brought me here!
Your Bike is lovely, too...
I absolutely love my Bike, but\nI’m not coordinated enough to ride it...\c\nI can’t ride, so I’m just sneakily watching\nall the people riding their Bikes.
I’ve finally made it to Mt. Chimney.\nI want to make my Pokémon battle!
The way you battle...\nIt’s just like a Mt. Chimney eruption!
Like I said, I’ve finally made it to\nMt. Chimney. It would be a shame if\r\nI only do a little sightseeing...\c\nI want to get in some battles and buy\nLava Cookies as souvenirs.
[~ 269]
Huh? Did I really lose?
[~ 271]
Hahahaha!\nHow about we have a battle?\r\nYou and me! Hahahaha!
I lost!\nHahahaha!
This isn’t fun at all, but for some reason \nI c-can’t stop laughing! Hahahaha!
My legs are solid from pounding up\nand down the mountains.\c\nThey’re not going to buckle easily,\nfriend!
Ouch! My legs cramped up!
Try hiking, and I mean really pounding, on these mountain\ntrails with a heavy pack weighing dozens of pounds.\c\nThat, my friend, will get your body in serious shape.
I’ve been keeping fit by hiking.\nPower, I have in spades!
I got trumped in power?
I hear there are some seriously tough\nTrainers on top of Mt. Chimney.\c\nI intend to get up there and give them\na challenge!
All right, take this.\nHikers have big enough hearts to praise the winner.
I’m strong.\nI won’t cry if I lose.
Waaaah!
I’m not crying because I miss my mommy!\nSniffle...
When you’re out on a picnic, why, you\nsimply have to sing!\r\nCome on, sing with me!
Oh, you’re so strong!
It doesn’t matter if you’re good or bad\nat singing or Pokémon battles.\c\nIf you have the most fun, you win!
Owowowowow!\nYikes, it’s hot!
I’m blinded by sweat in my eyes...
A hot bath promotes circulation.\c\nIt’s effective for healing pain in\nyour joints.
[~ 291]
[~ 292]
[~ 293]
I’m trying to relieve my stress.\nDon’t come along and stress me out!
I hope Flannery burns you good!
Haaah... Whew...\c\nIf you spend too much time in\nthe bath, it tuckers you out...
[~ 297]
[~ 298]
[~ 299]
You must be getting tired by now.\nYou’d like to rest in a hot bath, eh?\c\nBut you should know that maintaining\nyour willpower is an important ability\r\nfor all Trainers.
Play with fire, get burned...
Your skill is real...\nBut our Leader Flannery is strong.\c\nIf you don’t watch yourself, she’ll\nburn you up!
Can you guess why it’s so cool\naround here?
Peeuuw!\nThat stinks!
The volcanic ash blocks the sun, so it\ndoesn’t get very warm.\c\nThat’s good for me—I can’t stand heat!
The volcano’s eruption is proof that\nthe world is alive.
You’re some kind of strong!
Ouch! Owww! I can’t see!\nI got ashes in my eyelashes!\c\nGet it? Ashes rhymes with lashes?\c\nOK, that was bad, sorry...

I’ll make sure you’ve\nbeen raising your Pokémon right.
Yes, you’re raising your Pokémon right.
If you feed Pokéblocks to Pokémon, the unique\naspects of their character will be enhanced.
I’ll make sure you’re still\nraising your Pokémon right.
You’re raising your Pokémon wonderfully.
Pokémon seem to like different kinds\nof Pokéblocks, depending on their nature.
For you, who has raised your Pokémon so well!
Yo-de-lay-i-hoo!\c\n...\c\nYou have to shout “yo-de-lay-i-hoo,” too,\nsince it doesn’t echo here!
Yo-de-lay-i-hoo!
When I was a wee tyke, I believed there\nwas someone copying me and shouting\r\nback, “Yo-de-lay-i-hoo!”
If you’re not prepared, you shouldn’t\nbe up in the mountains!
The mountains are unforgiving...
In the winter, mountains turn deadly\nwith blizzards and avalanches.
Camping’s fun! You can fish, roast\nmarshmallows, and tell spooky stories!\c\nBut the best of all are the Pokémon\nbattles!
Way too strong!
I’m happy enough just going\ncamping with my Pokémon.
I need to exercise after a meal.\nLet’s have a match!
Oh, no!
I just had a tasty meal.\nI’m getting drowsy...
Ufufufufufu...\nWant to battle against my Pokémon?
M-my Pokémon...
A big body that’s all lumpy and hard,\nenormous horns, and vicious fangs...\c\nUfufufufu...\nI wish I had a Pokémon like that...
Ufufufufufu...\nCome on, battle my Pokémon...
I feel so lucky getting to see your\nPokémon...
Ufufufufufu...\c\nWhen I see Pokémon battling, I get all\nshivery and shaky...
Ufufufufufu...\nYou want this? You want this, right?
Hmm... You seem rather capable.\nLet me keep you company!
You’re much stronger than\nI imagined!
There is no such thing as a born genius.\nIt all depends on effort!\r\nThat is what I believe...
Hmm... As always, your agility speaks for itself.\nCome, keep me company!
As strong as ever!
All it takes is effort!\c\nI lost because I haven’t put in enough\neffort!
I, the defeated, shall\nsend you, the victor, this.
My!\c\nMachop!\c\nDemand a battle!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
My Machop crew!\c\nSo long as they seek power, I will\ngrow strong with them!
My strongest skill is busting bricks\nwith my forehead!
Ugwaaaah!\nMy head is busted!
I’ve been teaching my Pokémon karate.\c\nLooks like it will be a lot better than I am!\nThat’s exciting!
After you beat me, we trained hard to\nimprove our skills.\r\nCome on, give us a rematch!
Ugwaaah!\nWe lost again!
My Pokémon will grow stronger!\nI’ll redouble my training!
I-I have no choice!\nI’ll give you this fair and square!
This beach is my secret training spot!\nDon’t come butting in!
I haven’t trained enough!
The sand acts as a cushion to reduce\nimpact and prevent injury.\r\nThis is the perfect place to train.
OK, let’s get this battle going!
I can battle, but my Pokémon...
Even when I lose, I still get some\nenjoyment out of it.\r\nIt must be that I love Pokémon.
Gracias for the bueno battle!\nHere you go! This is my way of saying gracias!
I have a rare Pokémon!\nWould you like me to show you?
You...\nYou want my Pokémon, don’t you?
I have this rare Pokémon.\nIt’s enough to keep me satisfied.
The aroma of flowers has a magical\npower. It cleanses us, body and soul.
Oh, dear me.\nI seem to have lost.
Flowers, Pokémon...\nI love whatever smells nice.\c\nStinky things...\nI’ll pass.
Were you drawn here by the sweet\naroma?
The power of aroma...\nIt didn’t seem to do much.
If you use Sweet Scent properly,\nPokémon will be attracted by it.
Ufufu... Will you check whether this\npresent from me is sweet or not?
Bird Pokémon that Fly elegantly in\nthe sky... They’re the best!
Urgh... I crashed...
You’ve got great Pokémon.\nI’ll have to train mine better.
We’re the Mimic Circle!\nWe Mimic what you do!
Whoopsie!\nI lost!
What’s so good about mimicry?\c\nFufufu...\nYou’ll never understand...
So, we finally meet!\nMy Bug Pokémon will keep you company!
I wish we’d never met...
I want to Mimic you some more.\c\nCan you hurry up and move?
If you step forward, we step forward.\c\nIf you turn right, we turn, too...
But if you win, I lose...
I can’t Mimic you winning the match.\nThat’s just impossible...\r\nIt’s burning me up...
Yep, you’ve finally caught me!\nOr were you trying to avoid me?
Whoop, that was a great match!
We’re the Mimic Circle!\nI hope you enjoyed our performance.
You don’t know who I am, do you?\c\nWell... I don’t know you, either.\nLet’s just battle anyway!
You’re pretty strong, aren’t you?!
Until you go away somewhere, we’ll\nkeep on mimicking your every move.
The Mimic Circle was formed by people\nwho like to Mimic.\c\nA battle starts the instant we meet!
I surrender!
Won’t you join our Mimic Circle?
Who has the knowledge and the\ntechnique for survival?\c\nPokémon Rangers, that’s who!
I didn’t have enough Pokémon\nknow-how...
To break away from civilization and\nawaken the wild spirit within!\c\nThat’s our vision.
I’m going to regain my wild spirit by\nbeing together with Pokémon.
You’re still strong!
Believe in your Pokémon.\nBelieve in yourself.\c\nThe road will reveal itself to you.
Can you take back your wildness by using this?\nThat depends on how motivated you are!
Oh? Look at you.\c\nFor someone on an adventure, you’re\ntraveling awfully light.
Accidents happen when you’re not\nprepared!
You’re traveling light but have\neverything you need.\c\nYou’re on top of things mentally and\nphysically, too.
How’s your journey with Pokémon\ngoing?
I’m still missing something...
In the same way that you, as a Trainer,\nrely on your Pokémon, your Pokémon\r\nrely on you.
I hope you find this useful on your\nadventure with your Pokémon...
The vast sky holds untold promise!\c\nNothing can compare to the sheer\nexhilaration of flight!
Down and out!
My bird Pokémon made my dreams of\nflying come true!
I’ll show you the true potential of\nmy bird Pokémon!
We lacked potential...
Ever since I was a little kid, I always\nadmired bird Pokémon...
To lurk in shadows, and live in\ndarkness... That is my destiny.\c\nI emerge to challenge you!
I admit defeat!
Those defeated in battle withdraw\nquietly back into the shadows.\r\nThat, too, is destiny...
If you’re not on your guard, you’re in\nfor some pain!
You’re surprisingly good!
My surprise attack ended in\nfailure...
Behold the elegant battle style of\nbird Pokémon!
You...\nYou’re strong...
A Trainer has to be smart to keep\nup with unexpected turns of events.\c\nLet’s see if you have the smarts to\nget to our Leader.

The lovers of bird Pokémon aspire\nto join this Gym.\c\nAs a member of the Fortree Gym,\nI’m not allowed to lose!
It was too much of a load for me\nto bear...
The world is huge, and there are\ncountless tough Trainers.\c\nI’m going to keep training and make\nmyself even stronger.
Do you have any moves that can strike\na flying Pokémon?
You soared above me!
The move Fly is convenient, don’t\nyou think?\c\nWhile the Pokémon is flying, almost\nno moves can strike it.
My Pokémon is strong!\nHow about your Pokémon?
You and your Pokémon were stronger...
A Pokémon that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.
A Pokémon that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.
You and your Pokémon are seriously strong.
My Pokémon is growing stronger.\nI have to grow stronger, too.
I want to go on an adventure like you someday!\nPlease take this as a sign of my respect.

I’ll check your Pokémon and see if\nthey’re fit for the outdoors.
With Pokémon that strong, you’re in\nno danger of needing rescue!
To travel wherever your heart desires\nwith Pokémon...\r\nThat’s the joy of being a Trainer.
How’s your physical fitness?\nIf you’re not fit, you could have a\r\nrough time in critical situations.
I’m totally fit, but...
Fitness training is in my routine.\nI always run with my Pokémon.
...\c\nWanna battle?
...\nI lost.
...\c\nI’ll try harder.
...\c\nWanna battle again?
...\nI lost again.
...\c\nI’ll try harder...for my precious Bug Pokémon.
...\c\nTake it...
Hey, could I get you to battle the\nPokémon I’m raising?
You’ve raised yours superbly...
Training Pokémon isn’t all about power.\c\nImproving a unique aspect of their character\nis another way of enjoying Pokémon.
The Pokémon I’ve been raising are\nlooking good, just like before.
You know how to raise Pokémon...\nYou might have Day Care skills.
You’re raising your Pokémon so well!\nMaybe you and your Pokémon should enter\r\nthe Contest Spectacular.
I wonder if this will help\nyou train Pokémon...

This is where we Dragon Tamers do our training.\c\nThe Champion even visits.\nNow do you see how special it is here?
Urgh!\nI didn’t expect you to be so strong!
The road ahead remains long and harsh.\c\nWhen will my Pokémon and I become the\nbest?
Since we met, we have trained hard\nwith our sights on number one.\c\nHelp us see how much stronger we’ve\nbecome!
Urgh!\nI didn’t expect you to be so strong!
You’ve obviously kept up your\nPokémon training.\c\nSo long as you remain strong, I, too,\ncan become stronger!
I give this to you, whose power has\nsurpassed that of Dragon types.
Hey, are you lost at sea?\c\nIf you can beat my Pokémon, I can\nguide you through the currents.
I lost my bearings in battle!
Many people lose their bearings at sea.\c\nIf you’re that sort, you should check your\nlocation on your AreaNav as you go.
Hmmph! You’re riding a Pokémon instead\nof swimming yourself...\c\nI’m so jealous!
Oh!\nIt’s no use...
I’m getting chilly...\nI’ve been in the water too long...\c\nI wish I could ride a Pokémon like you...
I heard you approaching, so I hung\naround waiting for you!
Have mercy!
Sound travels faster in water than\nit does through air.
Hey, there!\nCheck out my sweet Pokémon!
I floundered...
I was blown away by Horsea’s charm,\nso I started swimming, too.
Swimming is a full-body workout!\nYou will get fit!
I admit it! You win!
Thanks to my daily swimming routine...\nLook! Feast your eyes on this physique!
This towering white mountain of rock\nis Sootopolis City.
Have I been beaten?!
I can’t find the entrance to\nSootopolis. Where could it be?
What a surprise! I didn’t expect to\nsee a Trainer out in the sea.\c\nI think we should battle!
This kid’s awfully tough...
Your eyes have that look of someone\nwho’s experienced harsh challenges\r\nand won. It suits you well!
The sea is teeming with Pokémon.\nIt’s not easy swimming, I tell you.
Pokémon raised by Trainers are\nseriously tough...
Gasp... Gasp... I’m wiped out...\c\nGoing’s easy. Coming back\nis the hard part.\c\nWill I have the energy left to make\nit back?
The sea... The sea... The sea...\nThe sea as far as these eyes can see!\r\nI’m sick and tired of the sea!
Bleah!
Bored I am by the sea, but swim I must.\c\nI’m a born swimmer!\nThat’s what I am.
I used to catch colds all the time as a kid,\nbut I became totally fit after I started swimming.
I wanna get stronger...
Trainers travel the fields and\nmountains, so they must be fit, too.
Did the currents carry you here, too?\nThis must have been fated. Let’s battle!
Strong!\nToo much so!
It’s just my luck that a tough Trainer\nlike you would drift here...\r\nI must be cursed...
Even Pokémon that can swim\nget swept away by these currents!
Aiyeeeeh!
It looks like Pokémon\nenjoy these fast currents!

If you just float in the sea like\nthis, Pokémon come around to play!
Oh...\nLost at sea...
While swimming, I noticed that some\nPokémon attack, and some just watch.\c\nI guess Pokémon have personalities\nof their own.
If you just float in the sea like this,\nTrainers challenge you!
That’s strange...\nI lost again...
This has nothing to do with anything,\nbut maybe I’ll visit the Trick House.
Darn!\nGo on and take this from me!
I’m getting tired of swimming...\nHow about a battle?
I had no idea that you were\nthis strong!
All the effort you put in must have\nmade you this strong.
I’m tired from swimming.\nAre you up for a battle with me?
You’re too much!
Whew...\nWhich way is it to Mossdeep City?
How would you like to take on the\nWater-type Pokémon I raised?
I lost...
Your power... You’re the real deal.\nI’m amazed!
Ufufufufu!\nI’m a mermaid!
My fantasy burst as if it were a bubble!\nBlub, blub, blub...
You thrashed me... I want to\ndisappear in a wave of despair...
Hello, kiddo!\nWant a battle with me?
Oh, nooooo!
I love frolicking with Pokémon in\nthe sea like this!
In the deep blue sea,\nmy shattered blue heart finds\r\ncomfort among waves.
Like the vast blue sea,\nthe world of Pokémon spans\r\ndepths beyond belief.
The world’s children dream\nof one day becoming the\r\nPokémon Champion.
Hi, sweetie, wait!\nWe should battle, you and me!
You’re tough in spite\nof the way you look!
Did you see a guy over there who whines\nthat he’s bored of the sea?\c\nThat’s all talk.\nHe’s hopelessly in love with the sea!
Why do guys make such a big deal about swimsuits?\nThey’re always staring!
I’m out of my depth!
Maybe it’s not my swimsuit they’re looking at.\nMaybe I’m just that beautiful!
I try not to swim where the currents\nare too strong.
Oh no!
If I get swept away, I’ll lose all my\nsense of place...
I’ve led a life of woe and misery...\nI’ve been cast away, and this is\r\nwhere I’ve drifted...
Another loss...
A life adrift...\nI don’t want it anymore!
Welcome!\nI’ve been expecting you!
No! Please!
A strong child Trainer...\nThat’s so annoying!
Even those Pokémon that can swim are\ncarried along by the rapid currents.
Aiyeeeeh!
I think Pokémon enjoy the fast-running\ncurrents around these parts.
My Luvdisc are looking for a fun\nmatch. Will you join us?
Oopsie!
There’s a collector who’s after the\nscales of Luvdisc.
Battles hinge on the strength of your\nspirit! The weak-spirited will never win!
I lost! I must temper my spirit again!
The indecisive lose.\nThat’s my warning to you.
Let me see your talent!
You possess spectacular talent!
If there are prodigies in the world,\nthen that’s what our Gym Leaders are!\c\nHowever, you may be even more\ntalented than they are...
Fufufufu... Watch me levitate a Poké Ball\ntelekinetically!\c\nWrooooooooaaaar!\n...\c\nSometimes, I’m out of sync...
My Pokémon battling skills are out of sync, too!
A Poké Ball was too heavy to lift,\nbut this dust bunny...\c\nWhoooooooooooooooh!\n...\c\nNo, I’m not cheating!\nI didn’t blow on it! Honest!
When you lose to me, don’t be too hard\non yourself.\c\nIt’s not that you’re weak—I’m just\ntoo strong!
You’re just too strong!
I’m not going to get down on myself for\nlosing. I just need to train harder.\c\nPositive thinking—that’s my strong\npoint!
I see it...\nI see your future...\c\nIf you can beat me, I will tell you\nyour future!
I surrender!
You will wage a terrifically intense\nbattle with our Gym Leaders...\c\nThe result...\nYou won’t hear it from me!
The roads you have traveled...\nWhat you have experienced...\c\nCome at me with everything you’ve\nlearned!
You’ve traveled a path of greatness!
A bright future awaits those who have\nworked diligently.\c\nFor those who lazed idly, there is\nonly despair at the end.\c\nWhat goes around comes around...
I can see it in your face. You want\nto challenge me.
Awawawawawa...
A well-played match leaves me feeling\nrefreshed and serene.

Ever Grande City is still a long ways\naway...
My first victory seems to be far\naway, too...
My whole life has been about losing,\nbut I will never give up!
I’m still feeling good. I’ll keep on\nswimming to Ever Grande City.
I’ve yet to taste my first victory...
If I don’t give up, I’ll win someday\nand make it to Ever Grande City, too.
Maybe you can use this to prepare\nfor your trip to Ever Grande City...

This is my first triathlon.\nI’m all tense and nervous!
Wroooaaar!\nI failed to win!
If I’m all tensed up, I won’t be able to\ngive it my all.

Like I figured...
[~ 628]
Ayiyiyi!\nSuspicious character spotted!
Grrrrr...\nI lost it!
I may have lost the battle,\nbut I’ve fulfilled my duty...
You have to defeat me if you want\nto learn the secret of our hideout!
I never had a chance!
The secret of our hideout?\c\nWe have a submarine all the way in the back!\nBut by this time, tee-hee...
Fuel supply: check!\nSnack supply: check!\c\nAll that’s left is to get rid\nof everyone who stands in our way!
I took a serious licking!
Hmmph! That was enough.\c\nMy mission was just to slow you down.
Ahaha! You really kept me waiting!\nHow about a battle with me?
I was waiting for so long\nonly to be defeated...
Boss...\nIs this good enough?
[~ 641]
Uwah!
[~ 643]
[~ 644]
The hurdles are too high for me out here on land!
[~ 646]
I have no time for children.\nRun along home now!
I wanna go home!
I want to be an Admin so I can\nmake my Grunts do all the work!
The submarine is small so it\nmakes you sore all over, doesn’t it?
Losing makes me sore, too!
That submarine we jacked, man, it’s\nbrutal as a ride.\r\nIt’s way too tight in there!
Who are you?\nHow did you get in here?
Lost it...
I can’t find the way out!\c\nI’m not afraid. Don’t get me wrong!
[~ 656]
[~ 657]
[~ 658]
The rich atmosphere of the mountain\nhas elevated my psychic power!\c\nA mere child like you...\nYou dream of winning?
I drown in self-pity...
My psychic powers have surely\ngrown several times, but...
[~ 662]
[~ 663]
[~ 664]
Hey! Are you searching for Pokémon?\nYou came along after me! How rude!
Ayieeeeh!\nI’m sorry, forgive me, please!
People don’t come here often, so\nI thought there’d be rare Pokémon.
[~ 668]
[~ 669]
[~ 670]
Fufufufu... I dive deep underwater\nto go deep under cover.\r\nPlumbing the depths is where I excel!
You can’t dive deep!
I have it on good authority that\nthere’s a Dive spot around here.\c\nIt gives me the urge to go deep\nagain...
Ahoy! I’m a buff, tough Sailor!\nI’ve braved the world’s seas!
Gwrroooar!\nI couldn’t win!
The tide ebbs and flows inside the\nShoal Cave.\c\nBy the way, it’s about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Did you know that?
It’s high time I get my payback\nfrom you! Come on, we’re battling!
I couldn’t win!\nI flat out couldn’t win!
The Shoal Cave...\c\nThere are places you can and can’t\nget to depending on the rise and fall\r\nof the tide.\c\nBy the way, it’s about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Don’t forget!
Feel free to take this\nas a gift from me to you.

That girl may have totally destroyed me\nearlier, but it can’t go that way all the time!
Am I doomed to repeat my mistakes?\nDoes this mean I’ll lose my next battle, too?!
Now that I’ve gotten a good look at you,\nyou’re that kid from the other day, right?\c\nPlease, you’ve got to help Archie and Shelly!\nThe way that girl handled her Pokémon...\c\nShe may actually be better than Shelly or\neven Archie himself!
Do you think I’m just gonna stand around\nwhile everybody pushes past me? Humph!
What! Are you gonna be someone\nelse who pushes right on past me?
That Whismur that broke through\nhere earlier was terrifying.\c\nThe lady with it was awesome, too,\nbut the Whismur scared the pants off me.
If you’re on the lookout for a battle at the Seashore\nHouse, you’ll find no hotter Trainer than me, matey!
That certainly was a hot battle!\nI can accept that loss, matey!
Whenever I’m in Slateport, I enjoy\nhot battles and ice-cold Soda Pop!
I’m going to show you how great my\nPokémon are, but don’t cry!
I lost, but I won’t cry...
If one of my Pokémon knew the move\nfor carrying me across water on its\r\nback, I could get rid of this inner tube.
I wandered into this weird house\nby accident...
And now I’ve lost...
I lost my way, I lost a battle, and I’m\neven more lost... I can’t get out...
I’ll hack and slash my way to victory\nwith the Cut we just learned!
Why are you so serious?
I never get tired of hacking\nand slashing!
Just who is the Trick Master?
I lost while I was lost in thought!
You’re strong!\nJust who are you?
It’s too much bother to think this out.\nI only wanted to battle!
Even though I lost, I still like battling the best!
Don’t you think? Wouldn’t you go anywhere\nif you knew there would be Trainers there?
[~ 738]
[~ 739]
[~ 740]
It’s dark—so dark...\nEven though we’re inside...
It’s far too dark and scary for me to battle...
What do they mean by “Trick House”?\nThis is just another haunted house...
[~ 744]
[~ 745]
[~ 746]
I want to make my own Gym one day.\nSo I’m studying how to set traps here.
I didn’t study battling enough!
You’re strong, aren’t you?\nMaybe even strong enough to be a Gym Leader!
[~ 750]
[~ 751]
[~ 752]
I’m looking to see if I can’t find\na Secret Spot around here...
I shouldn’t have battled...
Wait a minute, are you looking for Secret Spots, too?\nThat makes us rivals, then, doesn’t it?!
[~ 756]
[~ 757]
[~ 758]
Heh! Boulders like the ones in this room,\nI can brush aside with one finger!
I can crush boulders, but I can’t find my way...
It’s not good enough to be brawny when\nyou don’t have enough brains. Be brainy!
Ugh! How long must this\ncrushing go on?\c\nMy Pokémon and I are\ngetting worn out by it...
I’m worn out...\nI’m all worn out now...
You and your Pokémon don’t\nseem to be affected at all.\r\nOr do you have your poker face on?
When I heard there was a strange\nhouse, I had to check it out.
I’ve discovered a tough Trainer!
I’m checking this place out,\nbut it’s really difficult, so I’ve had to\r\nrepeat the challenge many times!
[~ 768]
[~ 769]
[~ 770]
I’m getting an ominous feeling about you...
I knew I would lose...\nYou’re a bad omen!
I wonder if Liza and Tate are OK...
I can’t get enough of the way you go\nfloating up softly in this Gym.
Oops, I gave you a soft match, too.
Are the traps here some kind of superpower?\nOr is this the latest technology?
[~ 777]
[~ 778]
[~ 779]
It’s not like I’m stranded or anything.\nThis is just what I do for training.
I can’t take it anymore...\nI’m too hungry to go on...
I’m pretending like I really did get lost to\ntrain for when I’m really in a survival situation.

We of Team Aqua are working hard for\neveryone’s sake.\c\nLike, if there’s more water around,\nWater Pokémon will be happy, and it’ll\r\ngive people more fun places to swim!
Hunh?\nWhat do you mean I lost?
Our Boss says, “It will make everyone\nhappy.”\c\nBut why does everyone keep getting\nin our way?
What’s this?! What’s this?!\nAnother intruder in our hideout?!
Uhhnn...\nI guess we’re open to the public...
Huh?!\nYou aren’t an intruder?\r\nSo you’re not with that girl and her Whismur?
[~ 801]
You’ve really done it, child.\c\nYou’ve shown a power that\nexceeds that of the great Maxie!
[~ 803]
[~ 804]
Ugh! You are...quite capable...\nI fell behind, but only by an inch...
[~ 806]
Hahaha!\nSuspicious person spotted!
Wh-what?! I lost!
I may have lost the battle, but\nI have fulfilled my purpose...
If you want to know the secrets\nof our hideout, try to defeat me!
I have no chance of winning...
The secrets of our hideout?\c\nWell... All the way in the back\nwe have a submarine!\c\nTee hee! But by now...
Energy supply: OK!\nSnack supply: OK!\c\nAll that’s left is to take out\nanyone who stands in our way!
I’ve been harshly defeated!
Hmmph! Fine then!\nMy mission was just to hold you up.
Wahaha! I grow weary of waiting!\nI shall have you give me a battle!
I grew weary of waiting and then lost...\nI’ve been defeated...
Leader...\nPlease forgive me...
[~ 819]
I’m speechless!
[~ 821]
I have no use for children!\nG’wan, get outta here!
I want to go home!
In the end, I was just an opponent\nfor a kid in a Pokémon battle...
The submarine is so small and cramped\nthat it makes your body hurt, but I don’t mind it.
It hurts when you lose!\nI don’t mind that, either, though.
Riding in the submarine we stole is the best.\nIt’s just wonderful that it’s so cramped.
Who are you?\nHow did you get in here?
That was a total and complete loss...
I don’t know where the exit is!\c\nI’m not scared, though!\nDon’t get me wrong!
[~ 831]
[~ 832]
[~ 833]
[~ 834]
[~ 835]
[~ 836]
[~ 837]
You’re so strong!
[~ 839]
Whoa!\nDon’t come near! Back! Get back!
I was knocked out. Out like a light!
Huh?\nYou aren’t with that girl who uses Dragon types?\c\nHow about that...\nIt was silly of me to be so scared, then.
I slipped up and let that girl defeat me earlier,\nbut it won’t go that way all the time!
Time and time again...\nI’m a man who can’t do his job...
Now that I get a good look at you,\naren’t you that kid from the other day?\c\nListen, our Leader and Tabitha are in danger.\nThe way that girl handled her Pokémon earlier...\c\nShe might even be better than Tabitha—no,\nthan Leader Maxie himself!
I can’t stand everybody\njust pushing right past me!
It’s laughable!\nThe way everybody pushes their\r\nway right past me is...laughable.
That Whismur earlier pushed past\nme with tremendous power...\c\nThe girl that ran through here\nwith it was amazing, too...\c\nBut, to be honest, the Whismur\nwas the scarier one.
[~ 849]
Hyuhn?!
[~ 851]
We of Team Magma are working hard for\neveryone’s sake.\c\nLike, if there’s more land, there’d be\nmore places to live.\r\nEveryone would be happy!
Hunh?\nWhat do you mean I lost?
Our Boss says, “It will make\neveryone happy.”\c\nBut why does everyone keep\ngetting in our way?
Hey, intruder person!\c\nYou know the rule! When our eyes meet,\nwe gotta have a Pokémon battle!
Guess you’re not the kind of opponent\nthat it’s OK for me to lock eyes with...
Since we transformed our organization,\nwe haven’t had even one intruder.\c\nCould this be the work of Team Aqua?\nWhy this? Why now?
[~ 858]
Ugh! Uhhn ugh!\nIs this the end of my evil deeds?!
[~ 860]
[~ 861]
Ugh! Uhhn ugh!\nIs this the end of my evil deeds?!

The Boss got interested in the\nresearch they have going here, so he\r\nsent us out.\c\nQuit your meddling!
Blast it...\nBlasted by a kid...
Our Boss knows everything.\c\nBut I’m just a Grunt. What would I know\nabout what he’s thinking?\c\nI wonder if Shelly can tell how clueless I am...
I came here because I heard that the Institute\nis investigating the relationship between\r\nsuper-ancient Pokémon and the weather!
Our plan’s being spoiled by a kid?
The overwhelming power of a super-ancient Pokémon to\neven control the weather freely...!\r\nWe, Team Aqua, definitely need it!
We’re Team Aqua!\nWe appear wherever anything rare is\r\nfound!
You got me!
You don’t have any idea what we of\nTeam Aqua are working toward!\r\nYou stay out of our way!
Huh?\nWhat’s a kid doing here?
Huh?\nI lost?!
Oh, no...\nI’ll catch an earful for losing to a kid...\c\nI should just take a nap in the bed...

I like to fish. But I also like to\nbattle!\c\nIf anyone challenges me, I’m there,\neven if I’m fishing.
I like to battle, but that doesn’t\nmean I’m good at it...
This time I’ll do it!\c\nI always think that, so I can’t walk\naway from fishing or Pokémon.
If the tunnel doesn’t go through, then\nI’ll just go over the top.
Gasp... Gasp...\nLosing made me tired...
It’s no big deal if there’s no tunnel.\nTo a Hiker, mountains are roads!
Don’t panic if your Bike’s going fast!
I shouldn’t panic during Pokémon\nbattles...
There’s no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There’s plenty of time.
Aren’t you going a little too fast?\nTake it easy and let’s battle.
I didn’t panic, but I still lost...
There’s no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There’s plenty of time.
Take your time. Take it slow.\nWell, just use this however you like.
All right! You’re gonna battle our Pokémon!
We’re twins, so we battle Pokémon together, too!
Gina: I’m so disappointed that we lost.\nMia: We lost even though we fought together...
You’re tough! We’ll train more!
We’ll train our Pokémon to get stronger like you!
Huh? You only have one Pokémon!\nWe can’t battle you!\c\nWe feel sorry for your lonely Pokémon,\nsince you only have one, after all.
Do you want to battle us? Then you’re\ngoing to need to bring two Pokémon!\r\nWe’re tough, after all!
Please don’t cry when your Pokémon lose!
All right! We’re gonna take out your Pokémon!
Miu: We lost...\nYuki: We lost...
You’re close with your Pokémon.\nThat’s why they’re strong!
How did you get so strong?\nThat’s the first time we lost a battle!
Battling without at least two Pokémon is boring!

Mt. Chimney’s Jagged Pass...\c\nNow this is what I’ve always wanted\nin a mountain.\c\nThis jagged bumpiness...\nIt rocks my soul!
Losing left me bitter!
Yes, I did lose at Pokémon...\c\nBut, when it comes to the love of\nthe mountains, I have you beat!
Jagged Pass is hard to walk on.\nIt’s a good place for training.
It was all over while we were still\ntrying to find our footing...
If I had an Acro Bike, I’d be able to\njump ledges.
I got used to this bumpiness.\nI sing while I climb now.
It’s still not easy to battle on this\nbumpy ground...
I should get an Acro Bike from Rydel\nin Mauville City...
Here you go. I carried this here across\nthe uneven ground, wobbling all the way.
This place isn’t your casual hike.\nIt’s not suited for a picnic.
Ohhh, no!\nThe ground is too bumpy...
Did you know?\c\nSome people skillfully ride their\nBikes up this horrible, bumpy pass.
Picnics are fun wherever you go.\nJust like Pokémon!
I only lost because the ground is\ntoo bumpy!
I’ll forget about losing and just\nenjoy this bumpy hike.
I want to forget that I lost as soon as possible!\nLet me off with this!

I’ll show you exactly how scary\nTeam Aqua can be!
So you think you can pick a fight\nwith Team Aqua all by your lonesome...
Yeah, so you are strong...\nBut there’re a lot of us!
What’s up with you, brat?\nWhat does a single kid expect to do?
Wow, you’re remarkably strong.
S-sorry!\c\nYou don’t know anything, though,\nso quit messing around with us!
Hey, I remember you from Mt. Chimney!\nIt’s payback time!
Urgggh...\nBeaten by some kid—again!
Heh, it doesn’t matter!\nWe bought ourselves some time!\c\nThe Boss should have snatched what\nhe was after!
I shall show you the true terror of Team Magma!
I see. Do you intend to defy\nTeam Magma all by yourself?
You certainly are strong...\nBut we are everywhere!
Who are you?\nWhat can a kid do all by h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imerself?
Hruh.\nI’ll feel that one later...
I-I surrender!\c\nBut how dare you get in our way\nwhen you know nothing of our plans?!
You... We met at Mt. Chimney!\nNow I’ll take my revenge!
Uhhn...\nI lost to a kid again.
That’s all right. I was able to buy some time.\c\nWe should have already stolen what the\nleader sent us here for!

Did you just become a Trainer?\nWe’re both beginners!
I challenged you because I thought I\ncould beat you...
I haven’t won once yet...\nI hope I win soon...
If you take Bug Pokémon to school,\nyou get to be instantly popular!
I can’t be popular if I lose.
If you have a big Bug Pokémon, people\nrespect you for it.
Check the growth of my Bug Pokémon!\nI’ll be popular again!
I can’t be popular if I lose.
You get to be popular if you have\nstrong Pokémon, right?\r\nThat’s why I’ve been training hard!

I found some cool Pokémon in the tall grass around here!
Being cool isn’t enough to win...
It’s hard to battle with Pokémon you\njust caught.
Once a Bug Catcher!\nAnd now a Bug Maniac!\c\nBut my love for Pokémon remains\nunchanged!
My ineptitude also remains\nunchanged...
All I did was follow my heart, and now\nthey call me a Bug Maniac...\c\nStill, I am an expert on Bug Pokémon,\nso it’s only natural that they call me\r\na Bug Maniac.
What do you call a man who lives among\nthe mountain crags? A mountain man, right?\c\nSo why don’t they call a Pokémon that\nclimbs steep cliffs a Pocragmon?
My Pokémon...\nRan out of power...
They halted development here to\nprotect Pokémon, right?\r\nThere’s a feel-good story!
I don’t know where you’re going, but\nwould you like to battle?
Oh, you’re disgustingly good!
I’m thinking that I should go to\nMt. Chimney, but the view around\r\nhere is very nice, too.
I’m full of pep!\nAnd my Pokémon is peppy, too!
My Pokémon lost its pep...
When I see a Trainer running around\nwith a lot of pep, I can’t help looking.
Show me how much you’ve toughened\nyour Pokémon.
I see, you’ve toughened yours\nconsiderably.
Pokémon and Trainers learn much\nthrough battling.\c\nWhat’s important is to never give up\neven if you lose.
We’re training here to elevate our\ngame to the next level.\r\nStay and train with us!
Ooh, you’re decent!
Since you’re that strong, you should\naim for the Pokémon League.
Please take this to commemorate\nthe training we did together!
Oh, you and your Pokémon look quite strong.\nWe simply must have a battle!
You didn’t just look strong, you are strong!
I thought I was raising my Pokémon\ndiligently, but, oh no, there is still\r\nmuch to be done.
You can make Pokémon stronger or\nweaker depending on the moves you\r\nteach them.\c\nWhat kinds of moves do your Pokémon\nknow?
You’ve taught them good moves!
Maybe I should have stopped my\nPokémon from evolving until they\r\nlearned better moves...
This is to thank you for showing me some nice moves.\nShow me some more next time, too!
To train myself, I challenge everyone I meet!
Uncle! I give up!
All I can do is keep training until I can\ndefeat strong Trainers such as you.
Since I bathed in the hot springs,\nI’ve been feeling great!\r\nI’m sure I’m going to win!
Huauff!\nI’m getting a chill being out of the water.
My nerves during that battle made me break out\nin a cold sweat. I’ll have to take\r\nanother dip in the hot springs.
Thanks for finding me!\nBut we still have to battle!
I’ll use my ninjutsu on you...\n“Volcanic Ash Swirl Cloak”!\c\nWhat? It’s already over?
You know what’s crummy about hiding?\nIt’s lonely if no one comes along.
I have a rare Pokémon!\nWould you like me to show you?
You...\nYou want my Pokémon, don’t you?
I have this rare Pokémon.\nIt’s enough to keep me satisfied.
I’m a Fisherman, but also a Trainer.\nI’m raising the Pokémon I caught.
I thought I was doing OK in my\ntraining...
I couldn’t win by training Pokémon\nwhile I fished...\c\nWas I doing things in half measures?
For Fishermen, equipment is the key.\c\nBut for Trainers, the key ingredients\nare Pokémon and heart, of course!
I was beaten in heart?
Come to think of it, fishing is a battle\nbetween a Fisherman and a Pokémon.
Take flight, my bird Pokémon!
They did take flight...
If they’d get stronger, they’d be able\nto fly more freely...
Good times are filled\nwith good aromas.
Oh...\nI smell the bitter scent of misery...
The Berry Master’s garden is filled\nwith uplifting fragrances.
I’m from Mt. Pyre...\nTaste the power my Pokémon and I have attained\r\nin the place where spirits of Pokémon slumber.
So powerful...
Mt. Pyre...\nWhere the spirits of Pokémon slumber...\r\nIt overflows with Psychic and Ghost power...
Being a psychic is about willpower.\c\nI’ve convinced myself that I won’t lose to\nanyone. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
Being a psychic is about willpower.\nI thought I wouldn’t lose to you...
I’ve convinced myself that I won’t\nlose to anyone. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
I should train at Mt. Pyre...\nI’ll never beat you this way...
To punish myself for being unable to win,\nI’ll give away some of my very own rare goods.

Pokémon have many Abilities.\nIf you want to become a first-class\r\nTrainer, learn about them.
You’re obviously thinking.
The Abilities of Pokémon\nwill make battle styles change.
I’m studying everything all over from the ground up.\nI figure this is my best route to being a first-class Trainer!
To be in your class still seems like a distant dream.
I’m going to start from the top again!\c\nJust as Pokémon have different Abilities,\nwe can live our lives in different ways!
To first-class you from second-rate me...\nHere you go.
Why am I carrying this parasol?\c\nI’ll tell you if you win against me.
A parasol can’t ward off Pokémon\nattacks...
I don’t think strong sunlight is good\nfor my Pokémon.\r\nSo, I shield them with my parasol.
Me, Pokémon, and my parasol...\c\nIf any one of them is missing, the\npicture of beauty will be ruined.
You’ve completely ruined my beauty...
A parasol wouldn’t suit you at all.\c\nWhy, something like this would only\nget in your way.
There are powers beyond our\nunderstanding in the world...
I have lost...
Mt. Pyre...\nThere is a mysterious power\r\nat work there...
With my Pokémon, I have traveled the\nworld’s four corners.\c\nYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.
Ah, well played.
I would like to circle the globe once\nagain with my Pokémon.
With my Pokémon, I have traveled the\nworld’s four corners.\c\nYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.
Ah, well played.
You and your Pokémon...\c\nYour prowess as a team would be\nworthy of respect, even overseas.
Woof. You bowled me over!\nThis is to mark the occasion of a razzle-dazzle battle!
[~ 1124]
I’ll get demoted if I lose, though!
[~ 1126]
[~ 1127]
What?\nWhat’s going on!
[~ 1129]
When I’m here...\nSome sort of power flows into me...
The power is ebbing away...
Perhaps the power is from the spirits\nof Pokémon in fitful sleep here...
Behind you...\nWhat is it...
Something faded away...
The Pokémon at rest here...\nSometimes, they play...
I’ll give you this, which I received\nfrom the Pokémon that slumbers here.
I love all things horrifying...\nIt’s like a disease...\c\nWhen I’m here...\nI shiver with fear...
Losing, I dislike...
I want to see dreadful things...\nI can’t leave...\c\nStay...\nWon’t you stay with me?
We’ve come to test our courage!\c\nMy girlfriend will love me even more when\nshe sees how cool I am. I’ll show her\r\nhow cool I am by knocking you out!
I’m really scared, but as long as\nI’m with my boyfriend, I’ll be OK!\c\nHe’ll try to show me how cool\nhe is by knocking you out!
Luke: Uh-oh!\nDez: Oh! I’m scared!
I lost, but that’s OK!\c\nAs long as I’m here,\nthis test of courage is no problem!
We’re so madly in love\nthat we don’t mind losing!
If you’re gonna battle us,\nbring some more Pokémon!\c\nOr else how can I show my\ngirlfriend how cool I am?
If you’re going to battle us,\nyou need at least two Pokémon.\c\nMy boyfriend is so strong,\none Pokémon is no match for him! 
Teacher...\nPlease watch over my progress!
Teacher...\nPlease forgive me!
Until I improve, my teacher, who rests\nhere, will never find true peace...
Yawn... Keeping watch over the\nhideout bores me, so I’ll take you on.
Yawn...\nOh, I lost...
If you hang around here too long, the\nother members of Team Aqua might get you.
Warp panels, the hideout’s pride\nand joy!\c\nYou’re clueless about where you are,\naren’t you?\c\nFluster and tire out the enemy, and then\nlower the boom! That’s our plan!
What’s wrong with you?\nYou’re not tired at all!
That reminds me... I can’t remember\nwhere I put the Master Ball.\c\nIf I don’t protect it, our Boss will\nchew me out...
Yawn... Keeping watch over the\nhideout bores me, so I’ll take you on.
Yawn...\nOh, I lost...
If you stick around here too long, the\nother members of Team Magma might attack you.
Warp panels, the hideout’s pride\nand joy!\c\nYou’re clueless about where you are,\naren’t you?\c\nFluster and tire out the enemy, and then\nlower the boom! That’s our plan!
What’s wrong with you?\nYou’re not tired at all!
That reminds me... I can’t remember\nwhere I put the Master Ball.\c\nIf I don’t protect it, our Boss will\nchew me out...
I should teach you how harsh battles\ncan be.
Oh.\nYou’re strong.
I’ll tell you something good.\c\nIf you want to reach Wallace, you\nneed to walk on each floor tile once.
The Pokémon Gym of the highest level\nin the Hoenn region...\c\nThat’s the Sootopolis Gym.
What a high level you are!
Rather than being satisfied by being\nin a strong Gym, I imagine training in\r\nother places will make you stronger.\r\nBut above all, it looks more fun.
Gliding across the ice\nin a single, graceful line...\c\nA Trainer who can do\nthat is elegant and beautiful!
Well, excuse me?!
This is really obvious, but how strong\nyou are as a Trainer has nothing to do\r\nwith how young or old you are.
I’ll show you the sublime techniques\nI learned from our Leader Wallace!
I’m sorry, Wallace...
Watch what happens if you crack all\nthe floor tiles.
You came all the way here, but you won’t\nget to see Wallace.\c\nNot if you lose to me, you won’t!
You’re strong!\nI was fooled by your cute looks!
You might be good enough to avoid\nbeing wiped out in one hit by Wallace.
I’ve made it this far a couple times,\nbut the last stretch is so long...
My dream ends here again...
You’ve made it this far. Keep the\nmomentum going and become the\r\nChampion! If anyone can, it’s you!
I didn’t come all this way to lose now.\nThat possibility doesn’t exist!
Impossible...\nI lost?
I lost here...\c\nThat means I lack the qualifications\nto become the Champion...
The thought that I’m getting closer to\nthe Pokémon League...\c\nI’m getting stage fright...
I couldn’t do a thing...
The Pokémon League became distant\nagain... What a letdown...
I trained together with my whole family,\nevery one of us!\r\nI’m not losing to anyone!
Better than my family?\nIs that possible?!
I was better than everyone in my\nfamily. I’ve never lost before...\c\nI’ve lost my confidence...\nMaybe I’ll go home...
I’d heard that there was a tough\nlittle kid around. Do they mean you?
The little shrimp is tough!
I heard a rumor that tough little\nkid is from Petalburg City.
This seemingly infinite and harsh road\nlives up to its name of Victory.
Your battle style is fantastic...
You seem to have the potential to\nbecome the Champion.
To win your way through the Pokémon\nLeague, you need to trust in your Pokémon.
Your relationship is based on\nsolid trust.
By being together all the time, trust\ngrows between Pokémon and Trainers.
This isn’t the goal. It’s only a stop\non the way to the Pokémon League.
That’s the way!
You’ll do fine, for sure!\nYour Pokémon are all eager to go!
You must be getting a little tired.
No signs of tiring at all!
Victory Road and the Pokémon League\nare long and grueling challenges.\r\nBeware of fatigue!
You shouldn’t get complacent just\nbecause you have a lot of Gym Badges.\c\nThere’s always going to be someone\nwho’s better than you!
You’re better than me!
Gaze on your collected Badges and\nremember the Trainers you’ve faced.
Erk. How annoying of you to follow us to the\nbottom of the ocean! Time to put an end to this!
What was that?\nEven the way you battle is annoying!
It doesn’t matter how hard you try.\nBy now Archie is already... Teehee!
What an annoying kid to follow us to the\nbottom of the ocean! That all ends now, though.
What an annoyance! Even the way you\nfight is just oozing with obnoxiousness.
It doesn’t matter how hard you try, anyway!\nBy now Leader Maxie is... Heehee!
Are your friends strong?
Your friends are, indeed, strong.
Friends need not be human.\nFor me, Pokémon are treasured friends!
Child...\nDid you knock on the door?
A loss is to be accepted without confusion\nor panic.
To never be ruffled in any situation is\nthe Gentleman’s code of conduct.
It’s a bit embarrassing, but we’ll\nshow you our crazy-in-love power!
It’s a bit embarrassing, but we’ll\nshow you our crazy-in-love power!
Jed: Huh...\nLea: No!
We’ve never lost using\nour crazy-in-love power!\c\nYou’re an amazing Trainer!
We’ve never lost using\nour crazy-in-love power!\c\nYou’re an amazing Trainer!
Just one Pokémon?\nDoesn’t that make you lonely?
I wanted to battle...\nYou don’t have two Pokémon, though.
Arrrgh! I’m fed up and dog-tired of\ncleaning this huge place!\c\nLet’s have a quick battle!
Little bro, I lost!
We’re the Cleanup Brothers!\c\nThe old one dumps the detergent,\nand the young one does the scrubbing!
This is the bottom of the ship’s hull.\nThere’s plenty of room.\r\nIt’ll be all right for a Pokémon battle.
Big bro, I lost!
We’re the Cleanup Brothers!\c\nThe old one dumps the detergent,\nand the young one does the scrubbing!
I can’t swim without my inner tube,\nbut I won’t lose at Pokémon!
Did I lose because I have an inner\ntube?
My inner tube is a fashion item.\nI can’t be seen without it.
Wahahah! I’m gonna catch me a big one!
I just lost one...
I think you’re a big one.\nNo, you’re a big-one-to-be!
Hi, big Trainer.\nWill you battle with me?
Oh, you’re strong.
How did you get to be so strong?
I take my inner tube with me everywhere!
Whoa, you overwhelmed me!
It’s not easy throwing Poké Balls\nwhile hanging on to an inner tube!
Observe the harmony between nature and the\nconstructed elements. This is pretty neat, isn’t it?
You’re pretty neat, too!
To see every last corner of this place, you’d need a\nPokémon move that’ll let you dive underwater...
We were looking for treasure\nwhen we found a Trainer!
Huh? We were looking for treasure\nwhen we went and found a Trainer!
Hal: We couldn’t even win battling together...\nLois: So strong!
We heard it was here, but we haven’t found any treasure.\nMaybe someone else already took it.
What kind of treasure would be in a dump like this?\nNo matter what it is, I know what I’m buying if we find it!
You don’t have two Pokémon.\nYou can’t beat us like that!
What? Don’t you have two Pokémon?\nLet’s put off the battle, then.
Our Pokémon got stronger while we\nwere looking for treasure all this time.\r\nTry facing us!
Huh? So we meet again! You’re not giving up\non your treasure hunt either, just like us!\c\nHow about we have a battle to decide\nwho will give up on the treasure?
Hal: You’re as strong as ever!\nLois: We lost again...
We can’t find the treasure, and our\nPokémon lost. I wanna go home!\c\nIf I say that out loud, though,\nmy girlfriend’s going to get angry...
I’m going to keep training my Pokémon.\nAnd I won’t go home until I find that treasure!
You don’t have two Pokémon.\nYou can’t beat us like that!
What? Don’t you have two Pokémon?\nLet’s put off the battle, then.
Instead of treasure, we losers\nproffer this distinguished item!
Instead of treasure, we losers\nproffer this distinguished item!
I’ve been to the hot springs and\nrefreshed my tired bones.\r\nRight now I’m feeling strong!
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren’t you something!
Well, well, I’ve lost. I can’t call\nmyself an Expert now, can I?
If you can mesh your heart with those\nof your Pokémon, why, you should be\r\nable to achieve great things.
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren’t you something!
Perhaps your heart has become one\nwith the hearts of your Pokémon.
For you and your Pokémon, whose hearts\nhave become one, a present from me...
If you’re lighting a campfire or\nsetting off fireworks,\r\nmake sure you have water handy.
Thanks for dousing my fire, I guess.
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\c\nDon’t ever underestimate the power\nof fire.
Have you learned to keep water handy\nfor campfires and fireworks?
I got hosed down before I could flare\nup, I guess.
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\c\nDon’t ever underestimate the power\nof fire.
My fire never really got burning, but a loss is a loss!\nI’ll give you this!
Let my melody rock your soul!
La-lalala...
An electric guitar doesn’t always\nhave to just be noisy...\c\nIt can be strummed to squeeze out\nthis heart-stirring melody...
A melody from my Pokémon and me...\nLet us deliver it to your soul.
La-lalala...
When I play, my emotions should reach\nyou through my electric guitar...
Placing this gift in your hand,\nI can almost hear a song surround us.

I’m in the middle of a triathlon, but,\nwhatever, let’s have a battle!
I ran out of energy!
I may have blown it...\c\nI might have dropped to last during\nthat battle...
I’m smack in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut I’m comfortably ahead.\r\nLet’s make this a quick battle!
I ran out of energy again!
I was tops in swimming and cycling, but\nI’m not quite that confident with\r\nPokémon yet.
I guess I’ll give you this prize I got\nfor winning a triathlon a long time ago.

Win or lose, you’ll never know until\nyou try!
Waah!\nI sank in defeat!
I never battle when I know I’ll win.\nI like to battle at the razor’s edge of\r\nvictory and defeat!
I want to win like everyone else, but I\nwon’t raise Pokémon like everyone else.
Darn it!\nMy way is still too slack!
It’s way more fun to do things the way\nI want than to be like everybody else.\r\nI mean, that’s obvious!
Okeydokey! That’s enough rest, gang!\nIt’s time for a match!
Tuckered out again...
My bird Pokémon get tired quickly after\na long flight...
The savage tide in this area serves to\nmake us stronger than ever.
I concede defeat.
We will return for more training at\nMeteor Falls.\c\nIf you’d like, you should go, too.\nIt will definitely toughen you up!
I came all the way out here with my\nbird Pokémon.
You...\nYou’re stunningly cool!
I’d like to go back to Fortree soon,\nbut for some reason I’ve grown\r\nto like this place, too.

Boring battles aren’t worth the effort.\c\nFiery hot battles are what toughen up\nTrainers and Pokémon!
That was fiery hot!
Whew, I’m all thirsty.\nMaybe I’ll have a Soda Pop.
There’s no need for Winona, our Gym\nLeader, to deal with you!\c\nI’m plenty good enough for you!
Winona, I...\nI lost!
Winona is cute and she’s strong.\nShe’s the ultimate Leader!\c\nBlush...
Winona taught me personally!\nYou can’t beat me easily!
I was beaten...
Thanks to Winona, the people of\nFortree can live without fear.

Through fishing, I have attained a\nstate of becalmed serenity...\r\nPlease, allow me to demonstrate.
Though I have lost, my heart remains calm...
It matters not that I catch nothing.\nThe line remains in the water...
Whoops! Don’t tell me I snagged\na surfing Pokémon?
I can’t keep up!
Your Pokémon look pretty strong.\nThey’d be a handful if I hooked them!
Well, hey! This is a match between a\nPokémon fan and a fishing buff!
No! My line’s all tangled!\nThe party’s over!
My fishing line’s doing a dance!\nThe tangle tango! Hahaha!
We’ve been working so hard to mount\na Pokémon League challenge...\c\nWe can’t afford to lose now!
Oh!\nHow could this happen?!
After all I’ve done to get here, I won’t\ngive up after one setback.
There is no stronger Trainer than I!
This can’t be!
There probably is no Trainer stronger\nthan you!
What I learned at Dewford’s Pokémon\nGym, I will put into practice here.
I was swamped!
Brawly, Dewford’s Gym Leader, used\nto train with a guy named Bruno in\r\nKanto, I’ve heard.
I want to visit Ever Grande, so I\ncaught myself a Pokémon that knows\r\nthe move Waterfall to crest the falls.
I’m crestfallen!
Awww, phooey!\c\nMy Pokémon know Waterfall, but\nI don’t have the Sootopolis Gym Badge!
Bird Pokémon have excellent vision.\nThey spot prey from great heights.
Whew... I give up.
There’re lots of diving spots in the\nsea around here.\c\nYou can spot them easily from the sky\nbecause of their darker color.
Say hey, hey!\nLet’s get on with it!
Beat, I’m beaten.\nThat’s it, done!
There’s nothing left for a loser.\nTime for me to beat it home.
What’s the hurry?\nLet’s take it slow and easy.
Oh, my.\nI wanted to relax a little more...
Don’t you hate making mistakes when\nyou’re in a rush?\c\nThat’s why I try to take things\nslowly.

Shall we use our power as\nbrother and sister to battle you?
Let’s battle as brother and sister!
Ian: I did my best with my\nbig sister, but we couldn’t win...\c\nRell: We couldn’t even win when\ncombining our powers as siblings.
People in Pacifidlog spend their\nwhole lives with the sea and Pokémon.
Pacifidlog is a town floating in the sea, right?\c\nThat means that Pacifidlog\nextends as far as the sea!
Don’t you have at least two Pokémon?\nWe can’t enjoy a Pokémon battle.
If you had two Pokémon,\nwe would give you a battle!
Aww...\c\nI came all the way down to the beach\njust to be with my little brother!\c\nI wanna have a Pokémon\nbattle to take my mind off it!
My big sister has a strong Pokémon!\nDon’t cry when you lose!
Rita: It’s your fault we lost, Sam!\nYou’re in trouble later!\c\nSam: Ughh. Sorry, Sis...
Aww...\c\nIf only it were my wonderful boyfriend\ninstead of my little brother beside me...
My big sister is really\nscary when she gets angry.\c\nShe sometimes scares people off.
Do you intend to battle us?\nYou need at least two Pokémon.
Do you intend to battle us?\nBring at least two Pokémon!
Aww...\c\nI came all the way down to the beach\nonly to be with my little brother!\c\nOh! Long time no see! Let’s\nbattle to take my mind off things!
If we lose, she’ll be angry with me!\nI’m really going to give it my all!
Rita: Sam! We lost because of you again!\nYou’re in for special training later!\c\nSam: Ughh...\nGimme a break already, Sis.
Aww...\c\nIf only I had a wonderful boyfriend to team up with,\nI’m sure we would never lose!
My big sister is really\nscary when she gets angry.\c\nShe’s gonna make me train\nmy Pokémon like crazy after this!
Do you intend to battle us?\nYou need at least two Pokémon.
Do you intend to battle us?\nBring at least two Pokémon!
I’ve got no choice...\nGo on, take this!
Wow... On top of losing, I have\nto give you an item, too...

We always have Pokémon\nbattles against each other!\c\nI always lose, but I can\nwin if it’s two-on-two!
Lisa: Amazing! Your strength\nis on a whole different level!\c\nRay: Well, your level is just too much higher.
Do you have any friends that\nyou go to the beach with?
I’ve been training the Pokémon\nI got from my big sister!\r\nIt’s my cherished partner!
If you’re gonna battle us,\nbring more Pokémon.
If you’re gonna battle us,\nbring more Pokémon.
You spoke to me...\nSo you want to challenge me!\c\nSure! I’ll try out the Pokémon\nI caught while surfing!
I don’t have a clue about what it\ntakes to win.
Go for a Surf on my Pokémon...\c\nThen fish off its back...\c\nIt’s an indescribably luxuriant moment!
[~ 1869]
Tate: Our... Our...\nLiza: Teamwork.
[~ 1871]
[~ 1872]
Well, how do you like that? I lost!\nEh, it was fun, so it doesn’t matter.

[~ 1881]

Go back and forth between Lilycove\nand Slateport, that’s what I do.\c\nIt’s my hobby—going from port to port\nto take in Pokémon Contest Spectaculars.
That was an enjoyable match!

[~ 1901]
Don’t take us Gym Trainers lightly!\nI’ll show you why we’re better!
You were too good for me...
You haven’t seen any of the Rock\ntype’s terrifying power—yet!
[~ 1905]
Whoa, wow! You made a much\nbigger splash than I expected!
[~ 1907]
I’m thirsty... I could go for a Soda Pop\nat the Seashore House...
Groan...
I’m getting famished... My inner tube\nlooks like a giant doughnut...
I’m hungry, but I’ve got enough pep in\nme for a battle!
I lost...\nIt’s because I’m hungry...
When you eat on a beach, everything\nseems to taste a little better.
Here, this is to say thanks for our battle!\nI am hungry, though!
I have foreseen your intentions!\nI cannot possibly lose!
I failed to prophesy my own demise!
I see your future...\c\nHmm...\nI see a shining light...
[~ 1918]
[~ 1919]
[~ 1920]
[~ 1921]
Wahahahah!\nFine, I lost!
[~ 1923]
This Gym’s got puzzles!\nIsn’t it fun?
It’s no fun to lose...
Wattson says he likes setting up\nlittle traps with switches.
[~ 1927]
Oh...\nI guess I was trying too hard...
[~ 1929]
[~ 1930]
...!\c\nImpossible...
[~ 1932]

[~ 1935]
[~ 1936]

[~ 1938]
I’m really jealous of your Go-Goggles...\nMy eyes hurt so bad...
My eyes...\nMy eyes...
If you have Go-Goggles, even desert\nsandstorms are no problem, you know?
My eyes may sting a bit, but I’ll still\nhave a picnic here in the desert!
Ohhh! You’re mean!
When you’re battling in a sandstorm,\nwatch out for your Pokémon’s HP.\c\nIt can faint if you don’t keep an eye\non it!
Does wearing those Go-Goggles make you\nfeel like some kind of a champion for justice?
I guess I can’t beat justice...
My family doesn’t have that much money,\nso I can’t get anyone to buy me Go-Goggles...
Wow, my eyes are crazy itchy...\nI should’ve brought some Go-Goggles.\c\nBy the way, I heard there are Fossils to be\nfound in the desert. Do you know where?
My eyes are itchy, and I lost the match...
If they can find Fossils in the desert,\nit must have been a sea once!\r\nBut that doesn’t make my eyes any less itchy...
For 30 years I have searched for ancient ruins!\c\nI’m so used to sandstorms that I don’t\neven need goggles anymore!\r\nAm I to be challenged?
While I have searched for ruins, I’ve\nnot searched for strong Pokémon.
For 30 years I have searched for ancient ruins!\c\nNo, wait, was that 40 years?\nWhich was it now?
For 30 years I have searched for ancient ruins!\c\nNo, wait, was that 40 years?\nAnyway, am I to be challenged?
I’ve found neither ruins nor any strong Pokémon...
For 30 years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\c\nNo, wait, was that 40 years I’ve\nsearched?\c\nHmm... It could even be 50.\nHow long have I been at this?
I found this in my 20th year of looking for ruins.\nI would be so honored if you would accept it as a gift.
[~ 1958]
Whoa! So strong!\nMy granddaughter wasn’t lying.
[~ 1960]
I use this parasol to ward off this\nfilthy, yucky volcanic ash from my\r\ndear Numel.
Huff, huff...\nI am exhausted...
You’re very good at this.\nI must say I’m impressed!
Oh, hello, hasn’t it been a while?\nMay I invite you to battle?
Oh, how magnificent!
You’ve remained very good at this.\nI must say I’m impressed!
To you, who are\noh so strong, I offer this.
Want to find out how strong you are?\nI’ll be the test!
You passed with flying colors!
To best even me...\nYour strength is marvelous!
You seem to have a big collection\nof Gym Badges.\c\nLet me see if you’re actually worthy of\nthose Badges!
Oh, you’re worthy, all right!
You did your Badges proud in that\nmatch!
Gabby: What an awesome battle!\nHey, did you get all that?!\c\nTy: Every last bit of that battle we\njust had is on this tape!
[~ 1975]
...\c\nI’ve lost...
[~ 1977]
When we’re together, nothing scares us!\nWe’ll show you how great we are!
When we’re together, nothing scares us!\nWe’ll show you how great we are!
Kate: I look so bad in front of Joy...\nJoy: Kate, I’m sorry!
Whenever anybody is counting on me\nit always makes me wanna show off...
Oh! I’ll have to train with\nmy teammate some more!
You have just one Pokémon,\nso we can’t battle!\c\nIt would feel like\nwe’re picking on you.
If you’re going to challenge us to a battle,\nyou need at least two Pokémon!
I wanna show my cute\nteammate how strong I am!
My lovely teammate and I\nwill team up to defeat you!
Anna: Hey! I’m in front of my teammate here!\nWould you let me win?!\r\nMeg: Oh no! Sorry, Anna!
Your Pokémon create\nquite a combination!\c\nYou might be almost as great as us!
I’m holding my teammate back...\c\nIf that weren’t the case,\nwe would’ve won!
Bring at least two Pokémon\nif you want to battle us!
You only have one Pokémon?\nWe can’t battle then.\c\nWe want to enjoy a two-on-two battle!
I can’t keep losing in front\nof my teammate like this...
This will be the time that my\nteammate and I defeat you!
Anna: I couldn’t get myself in gear.\nMeg: You’re too strong.
Your Pokémon create\nquite a combination!\c\nYou might be almost as great as us!
Even though my teammate and\nI fought together, we still lost...\c\nWhat a letdown!
Bring at least two Pokémon\nif you want to battle us!
You only have one Pokémon?\nWe can’t battle then.\c\nWe want to enjoy a two-on-two battle!
I would hate to burden my partner,\nso I’ll give you this from me.
I couldn’t possibly burden my partner,\nso go on and take this from me.

From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
Perhaps I should battle straightforwardly without hiding...\nI bid thee farewell.
Even if there are no ashes, I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
Whether I hide or not, the results of my\nbattles are always disappointing.\c\nThe path of the Ninja Boy is harsh...
I hope you will accept this.
Who might you be?\c\nAre you perhaps searching for ancient\nruins that are rumored to possibly\r\nexist according to legend?
What a disgraceful setback...
That giant rock... I would like to\nbelieve it may indeed contain ancient\r\nruins, but I see no entrance.
Stop! Have a good look at my precious\nPokémon!
Oh, how dare you!\nDon’t take it so seriously!
Maybe I’ll go catch some more Pokémon\nat the Safari.
My precious Pokémon grew!\nHave a good look!
Oh, how dare you!\nYou still won’t take it easy!
Maybe I’ll go catch some more Pokémon\nat the Safari.
I’ve got no choice. Here! Take this item that\nI’ve been keeping warm with my body heat.
I train my Pokémon with\nWallace.\c\nDon’t think I’m a pushover.
I was bowled right over...
I think you have potential.\nWhy don’t you stay and train with us?
There’s supposed to be a mystical\nrock around here.\r\nDo you know anything about it?
I was thinking too much about that\nrock, so my Pokémon remained weak...
I can spend hours and hours staring\nat a nice rock without growing bored.

Can your Pokémon withstand\nthe heat from my Pokémon?!
It didn’t burn hotly enough...
You withstood our heat without any trouble,\nso you and your Pokémon should be able to\r\nsurvive in magma easily.
With my charm and my Pokémon’s moves,\nyou’ll be shocked!
I’m shocked by your power!
I’ve heard that Mauville was founded\nby Wattson.\c\nHe was a Trainer long before we\nbecame Trainers.\r\nHe must know all sorts of things!
Um...\nOK, I’ll battle with you.
Oh, but you’re too strong.
I’m going to be a pretty and strong\nTrainer just like Flannery.
To hide a tree, use a forest!
I bow to your superiority.
To hide a tree, use a forest!\nTo hide a Pokémon, use a Pokémon!\c\nThere is no deep, hidden meaning\nto that.
I will adopt the movements of Pokémon\nand create new ninja techniques.
The creation of new ninja techniques\nremains but a distant dream...
Perhaps I ought to apprentice with\na ninja sensei.
We ninja conceal ourselves under our\ninvisibility cloaks.\r\nI bet you didn’t know where I was!
I lost!\nMy invisibility cloak failed me, too!
We ninja make the papier-mâché for\nour invisibility cloaks by hand!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHow are you doing?\c\nI’ve been training nonstop—\nso I was taking a short rest.\c\nSince I managed to run into you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nit seems like this will be a perfect\r\nchance to see how much I’ve improved!
Ugh. So this is my limit.
I knew my team makeup was still off.\nThen...I guess I need to take this guy out.\c\nNo, if I do that, I’ll be wide open for...\nHmm... Then if I replace this move here...\c\nYeah... Yeah, that should do it!\c\nOh! Excuse me!\nI couldn’t help myself!\c\nBut you’re just as brilliant in battle as ever,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nStill, don’t you count on me just losing to\nyou forever.\c\nI’ve met a lot of people who have helped me\ngrow since coming to the Battle Resort, and it has\r\nreminded me all over again how much fun\r\nit is to really go all out in battle!\c\nThanks again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s battle again sometime!

There’s supposedly a strange old man in Shoal Cave!\nAre you on your way to meet him, too?
Is there really anything\nin a place like this?
Kim: I thought we would win, though.\nIris: We almost had you for a second there.
There’s a strange old\nman in Shoal Cave, right?\c\nLet’s go meet him!
Are we really going into Shoal Cave?\nWe’re gonna get wet...
No way! I’m telling you, there’s no way we\ncan battle if you don’t have two Pokémon!
We would never stoop to\nhaving a two-against-one battle.
Yeah, I’m kind of in the mood\nto teach you how to battle.
Who taught you to battle like that?!
Tyra: What an amazing way of battling!\nIvy: What an amazing way of battling!
I taught Ivy all about Pokémon!
What got me started with Pokémon was\nwhen my teammate taught me how to battle.
Ah-ha! If you’re going to battle us,\nyou’ll need more than one Pokémon!
You only have one Pokémon?\nI feel like it must be lonely.
Oh no!\c\nI don’t want you interrupting\nour time alone together.
Our love for each other\nis heating up Hoenn!
Paul: Whoa, you got us!\nMel: It’s all my fault we lost!\r\nNow Paul’s going to hate me!
Don’t tell anyone you saw us here!\nThis is our place to be alone.
Hey, Paul, you aren’t mad at me, right?\nThat would make me so upset.
We’re madly in love, so we battle\nwith two of our Pokémon together!
We’re madly in love, so we battle\nwith two of our Pokémon together!
We’re always battling our Pokémon\nagainst each other, so we’re confident!
It’s been 50 years since we got married...\nNothing can break our bonds of matrimony!
John: Oh no, we lost, honey.\nJay: Oh no, we lost, sweetie.
Wow, 50 years of marriage...\c\nCome to think of it, I’ve never\nbeaten my wife in a Pokémon battle.
Yes, in 50 years of marriage...\c\nWe always had Pokémon battles\nwhenever we got in a fight.
Oh, aren’t you a young Trainer?!\c\nIf you’re going to battle us,\nbring some more Pokémon!
My, you’re a young Trainer!\c\nIf you’re going to battle us,\nbring some more Pokémon.
We’ve always enjoyed Pokémon\nbattles as a couple, so we’re confident.
Well, 50 years of marriage...\c\nSupporting each other all that\ntime has made us a strong couple.
John: Oh no, we lost, honey.\nJay: Oh no, we lost, sweetie.
So, 50 years of marriage...\c\nCome to think of it, I’ve been\nbattling my wife every single day.
Yes, in 50 years of marriage...\nSo much has happened.\c\nI hope my husband and I have\neven more fun times together.
Oh, aren’t you a young Trainer?!\c\nIf you’re going to battle us,\nbring some more Pokémon!
My, you’re a young Trainer!\c\nIf you’re going to battle us,\nbring some more Pokémon.
We bought this item to commemorate our\n35th wedding anniversary. I want you to have it.
I don’t know if young people these days would\nbe happy to get something like this, but...

Oh, sure, I’ll accept your challenge.\nI have a lot of money.
Why couldn’t I win?
There are some things money can’t buy.\nPokémon battles are one of them...
After I lost to you, I learned a bunch\nof things about Pokémon.
I lost again?\nWhy couldn’t I win?
I’m fabulously wealthy, but I can’t\nseem to win at Pokémon...\c\nIt’s so deep, the world of Pokémon...
If it’s money, I have more than I could ever need.\nI’ve got more items than I could possibly use, too.
We must have been fated to meet.\nMay I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my!
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.
Hello, we meet again.\nMay I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my...\nI did the best that I could...
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.
To commemorate our battling once more,\nplease take this as you go on your way.

My Pokémon is delightfully adorable!\nDon’t be shy—I’ll show you!
Oh, my gosh!\nMy darling Pokémon!
My delightful Pokémon looks darling\neven when it’s fainted!
Hi, you! My delightfully adorable\nPokémon has become even more darling!
Oh!\nMy darling Pokémon!
The more time I spend with it, the more\nadorable my Pokémon becomes.
I bought this item for my Pokémon, though...
Will you play with my delightfully\npretty Pokémon?
That isn’t what I meant!
I’m going to a contest in Lilycove.\c\nMy Pokémon should have no problem\nsweeping the Master Rank.
The sight of Wallace conducting a\nbattle...\c\nThe very beauty of it compelled me to\nbecome a Trainer.
You battled with more beauty than\nI could muster...
The grace you bring to battle is\nfabulous.\c\nOh... I’m so fortunate to have found\nPokémon.
When I gaze upon Wallace, time\nflies by before I can say “oops!”
Oops!
I wish I could forget about losses as\nquickly as you can say “oops!”
Oh, you’re such an adorable Trainer.\nWould you like to have tea?\r\nOr would you rather battle?
I see.\nYou’re the active sort.
A world cruise on a luxury liner has its\ncharms, I must say...\c\nBut, I will admit there is an appealing\nside to touring Hoenn by ferry.
Ah, you’ve come just in time.\c\nI’m bored, you see.\nYou may entertain me.
...That will do.
Perhaps I shall get Father to acquire\na yacht for me.\r\nA yacht for me and my Pokémon!
Ha ha ha! I would go anywhere to show\noff my delightful Pokémon.
Oh, dear, this won’t do.
Perhaps I should groom my Pokémon for\nthe Contest Spectacular rather than for battles.
Ha-ha-ha! I would be happy to show\noff my Pokémon as often as you like!
Oh, dear, this won’t do.
The Contest Spectacular is delightful,\nbut I like to battle, too.
I guess it can’t be helped.\nA loss is a loss is a loss is a loss.

Roxanne will be number one for all eternity!\nYou’ll be a piece of cake for her!

Oho!\nThat’s a loss I can be proud of!
Hah! Hah!\nAhya! Ahya!
Hah...hah...\nThat tired me out...
...Funny. ♪
Muwuhahaha!\nThat battle was fun even though I lost!
Hah hah...\nUhn...hah hah...
Oho!\nThat hurt just about exactly as much as I figured!
Just barely...
Oohwaahhhh!

Hey now!
You’ve mastered the Inverse-o-matic to such a high level!\nAs the developer, I couldn’t be happier!
I knew it would turn out like this...\nI’m so bummed out now...
Thanks!\nYou saved the best for last!
Thanks!\nYou saved the best for last!

As a bird-Pokémon user, I solemnly\nswear to battle fair and square!
As a bird-Pokémon user, I admit\ndefeat fair and square!
Gym Leader Winona leads the way for\nall of us who use bird Pokémon.\c\nI began walking the path of a Trainer\nbecause of my desire to live like her.
Hohoho! You’ve left yourself open!\nWith ninjutsu, I will conceal myself in steam!
This steam stings my eyes!
Flannery and I thought up the idea\nof hiding in steam together.
I feel like my brain is melting...\nLet’s hurry up and battle...
I’m so dizzy...
Urk... I might’ve stayed in too long...\nMy Pokémon and I are at our limit.
My Pokémon and I are proud of our\nstamina. We can swim all day long.
We’re drowning!
I’m totally fine with swimming all day,\nbut my body gets all soft and wrinkly.
I was born in a village far from the sea,\nso I’ve always dreamed of coming to Hoenn.
You grew up with the raging seas, didn’t you?
Even the salty smell of the sea is fresh to me...\nI’m really glad I made this trip.\c\nI still want to make more memories on my trip,\nthough, so battle me again!
Oh, it’s you! You’ve come to\nhelp me make some memories!
What a good memory...
I want to make so many memories on my journey\nthat I won’t be able to fit them all in my backpack.
Thank you for helping me make\nmemories! I’ll give you this as thanks!
Are there any drowning Pokémon or Trainers here?\nI’ve taken it upon myself to go on swim patrol.
Waahh! I think I might drown!
I’d rather be a lifeguard than an athlete.\nIt sounds cooler, right?
It is I who has come splashing over to you!\nBe not surprised by this Ace Trainer!
Splash...
Swept away, splashing, I am a Trainer adrift...\c\nI look forward to being swept\nback to you again someday!
Swept away, adrift, it has been too long!\nLet us drift along together!
Splash...splash...
I hope to drift away forever.\nI offer my life up to the waves and the winds...
This was swept here by the sea.\nPlease take it, if it pleases you.
We Ace Trainers care not where we\nare when we train...or battle!
How could I lose here?
I develop my balance by standing\non top of Pokémon in the raging seas.
Urp...ugh...uhh...\nHurry up...guhh...and...start...
Urp...ugh...I can’t take it anymore!
Ah...where’s the shore?\nWhich way to solid ground?\c\nUgh...uhh...please...\nI’m uneasy here, so please come again.
Urp...ugh...uhh...\nIt’s you... You’re all right.
Blechh! I knew I couldn’t do it...
Ugh...it only gets worse when I move...\nWhat should I do?
Uhh...thank you for coming to see me...\nTake this with you if you like...
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What’s the deal?\nAre you after my snow cone?!
Wh-where did you come from?
Oh!\c\nIt melted...\nMy...my snow cone...
Pokémon are even more lively than\nusual when they get out here in nature!
Even though I lost, I feel refreshed.
Sure enough, Pokémon fit\nbetter in nature than in a city.
Huh? What are you doing in a place like this?\nCould it be that you’re lost, too?
I lost my way in that battle, too.
I was curious about some Pokémon tracks,\nbut when I followed them, I got totally lost!
Are you looking for Pokémon as well?
You’re a strong Trainer.
I think there are many Pokémon around here.
The burger I ordered is taking forever!\nIt’s making me so totally crabby!
Gosh! I’m starving!
There’s something special about the\nfood at the Seashore House, isn’t there?\c\nIt’s not like it’s particularly good or anything,\nbut I never want to miss out.
I’m not such an amateur that I’m going\nto take it easy just because you’re a kid.
That was the work of a pro...
Hehehe...\nYou’re a pro, huh?
Fairy-type Pokémon are highly\nflammable, so do be careful!
I got completely burned up.
About these Fairy-type Pokémon...\c\nHow can I make them get\nalong with Fire-type Pokémon?
Hahaha...\nDon’t fog up my goggles!
Sniffle...sniffle...
This is no good...\nI fogged up my own goggles with all these tears!
Are there any ruins that would\nsatisfy me around here?
Oh! What a mystery!
I’m traveling the world on business.\nAll the ruins in the Sinnoh region got me really excited!
I bought this swimsuit last year,\nbut it doesn’t fit anymore.
My body feels heavy...
I swim with Water types every day as part\nof my fitness program, but I still feel heavy.
My hobby is Pokémon-Amie.\nWhat? You got something to say about it?!
I’m not very good at battles.
Whether it’s fashion, playing, or whatever,\nmaking fun of someone’s hobby is insensitive.
My face is so scary that when I walk\nin the tall grass, nothing appears at all...
It must be nice to have strong Pokémon...
I was having such a hard time catching Pokémon,\nso I decided to raise them from Eggs instead.
Oh! It’s you! How have you been?\nLet’s celebrate meeting up again with a battle!
Your Pokémon are as strong as ever.
Hmmm...\c\nIf my face is too scary for Pokémon\nto come to me in the tall grass,\r\nmaybe I should try wearing a mask...
You’re as strong as ever!\nConsider this your allowance.
I’ll tell you this right up front...\nI’m super-crazy weak!
See...
I have confidence in my physical strength,\nbut I’m totally awful at being a Trainer.\c\nIt was fun battling you, though.\nWe should do it again sometime.
Oh, it’s you! You’re, like, back for another\nbattle, right? I might be a little better...
Hmm...you sure are strong.
I knew it would be fun to battle you.\nLet’s do it again sometime, if you feel like it.
Thanks for hanging out with me!\nI’ll give you this, so use it if you’d like.
When I told everyone that I can talk with\nPokémon, they became concerned for me...
My Pokémon! You aren’t in pain, are you?
It’s more fun to be with Pokémon\nthan to talk with people...\c\nBattling with Trainers may be a bit fun, though...
Oh! Hello, Trainer.\nYou must be here for a battle, no?
My Pokémon seemed to enjoy that.
It’s more fun to be with Pokémon\nthan to talk with people.\c\nBattling Trainers makes Pokémon happy,\nthough, so I don’t mind you.
That was fun.\nHere, take this...
Pokémon are precious companions\nfor me on this long trip.
How did my companion do?
The toughest thing about being\non a trip is being alone.\c\nAs long as I have my Pokémon,\nthough, it doesn’t bother me!
I’ve been alive for 54 years!\nMy life has been all about battles!
How could this happen to me?
The Pokémon from that battle and\nI have been together since I was born.
Whoa, you look, like, totes strong and stuff.\nMaybe I shouldn’t be doing this...
See?! I knew it!
Honestly, Super Training is just a pain.\nTraining Pokémon is, like, super hard.
I’m always after the big one!\nI’ve got no patience for small fries!
That one was even bigger than I expected...
The tug on the line is\nthe essence of fishing.\c\nExcitement lies in the\nstrong pull of a big catch!
I throw my line in and settle back\nto ponder all sorts of things...\r\nLike, what is a Pokémon battle?
Fishing is philosophy...
To find peace in one’s heart,\none must only throw in a line.
Fishing is a battle between people and Pokémon!\nIt’s no hobby or sport or anything like that!
This is a battle, too.
There are apparently several kinds\nof fishing rods in the world.\c\nI’d like to catch Pokémon with each one of them.
Glug...glug glug...glug!\n(Hey! Did you come for a battle?!)
Glug...
Glug glug...glug!\n(That was fun! Let’s do it again sometime!)
Glug...glug glug...glug.\n(Another battle, eh?!)
Glug...
Glug glug...glug...\n(It was as fun as I expected!)
Glug glug...glug...\n(I found this, but you can have it!)
Glug! Glu-glug!\n(Hey! Who do you think you are?!)
Glu-glug! Glu-glug!
Glu-glug! Glug! Glug-ug!\n(The Pokémon ran away!)
Bloo-bloop... Bloop...\n(Oh? An invitation to battle, yes?)
Bloop...
Bloop... Bloo-bloop... Bloop...\n(That was fun! Do come again!)
Bloo-bloop... Bloop...\n(Long time no see! I’ve been waiting for you!)
Bloop...
Bloop... Bloo-bloop... Bloop...\n(Thanks for coming all this way!)
Bloop...\n(Thanks for coming. Here’s a souvenir for you.)
Bloop-oop... Bloop-oop-oop...\n(The sea in Hoenn is truly beautiful.)
Bloop...
Bloop bloop... Bloop-oop...\n(Just being underwater puts me in a good mood.)
Glug... Glug glug...\n(I’m looking for a Pokémon called Corsola.)
Glug glug glug...
Glug glug... Glug glug glug...\n(I’m doing some Corsola watching.)
Bloop! Bloop-oop-oop!\n(It’s not like I’m drowning or anything.)
Bloop-oop!
Bloop! Bloop! Bloop! Bloop!\n(I’m just searching for my prey.)
Ace Trainers can even appear in the sea!\nYes, even those who can’t swim!
I’m gonna fall in!
Whoa, I was just about to fall off my Pokémon.\nIt’s not easy being an Ace Trainer.
I’m wearing my swimsuit under my shirt.\nThe shirt makes it plain that I’m an Ace Trainer.
Water splashed on me.
Oh no, my shirt is soaked...\nMaybe I’ll just transform into a swimmer.
Oh, you wanna battle, do you?\nTake a deep breath and it’s on!
The water stings my eyes.
Even when I’m a soaking-wet loser,\nthe fact remains that I am one cool dude.
Actually, even if I didn’t have\nthis tube, I could still swim!
My tube got in the way!
My mom told me I have to bring my tube\nwhen I go swimming, so it can’t be helped!
For some reason this tube looks like a doughnut.\nI wonder if it would be as delicious...
I’m hungry.
I love doughnuts!\nI wonder if Pokémon do, too.
I feel like I’m losing my edge just\ndrifting along with the waves.
Losing doesn’t bother me.
As I watch everyone floating on the waves,\nit makes me feel like everything’s all right.
Apparently in the Hoenn region a legend has been\npassed down that it’s the birthplace of Mega Evolution.
Mega Evolution, huh?
Researching Mega Evolution here in\nHoenn will lead to unraveling its mysteries.
Don’t lump me in with those Swimmers!\nWe athletes have come to battle!
Will I go down in the sea?
The triathlon is known as the sport of iron men!\nIn order to win out in this cruel battle,\r\ntraining with Pokémon is indispensable!
Glug glug! Glug-ug-ug-ug!\n(I’m right in the middle of a treasure hunt!)
Glug-ug!
Glug! Glug! Glug-ug-ug!\n(Underwater—now that’s adventure!)
Glug-blug! Glug-blug-ug!\n(It’s possible to dive even if you can’t swim.)
Glug-glug-blug-ug! Glug-blug!
Glug-blug-glug-ug! Glug-blug-ug-ug-ug!\n(Diving is easy. You just have to sink.)
Bloop bloop...\n(Oh, you’re a Trainer, aren’t you?)
Bloop...
Bloop bloop bloop bloop...\n(You can’t skin dive, can you?)
Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop!\n(I became a Water-type Pokémon!)
Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop!
Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop!\n(My dream of becoming a Pokémon came true!)
Hurry up and get started already!\nThis sea breeze is bad for my skin!
It’s over... It’s over...
Between the UV rays pouring down and\nthe saltwater, this is the worst for my skin!\c\nI hate the sea!
The trick to fishing with a rod is to put\nyour back into it! That’s the key!
Way to put your back into it!
Using your back will help you improve\nat fishing more than anything else.\c\nWell then, you should try it, too!\nGo on, put your back into it!
Once you’ve cast your line, the idea is\nto hang in there until you catch something.
It got away from me.
Patiently enduring the wait until you catch\nsomething develops your staying power.
I was just napping on the beach when\nbefore I knew it I had been swept away!
Glug glug...
The sound of the waves is my lullaby.
I’m crazy about fishing but not very good at it.
You got me.
I battle and fish because\nI enjoy doing those things.\c\nI can enjoy myself\nregardless of the result.
On a journey to the land of Hoenn...\nCame an invitation to a Pokémon battle.
I lost...
Having a Pokémon battle at my destination\nmakes me feel the elegance of my journey.
Glug-ug... Glug-ug-ug-ug...\n(The seas in Hoenn are famous for their beauty.)
Glug-ug.
Glug glug-ug...\n(A lot of divers dream of coming here.)
Glub... Glub...\n(Can you understand my hand signals?)
Glu-ub-ub-ub...
Gluh... Glub-ub-ub...\n(They mean, “Battles are fun!”)
Blub! Blub-ub-ub!\n(Will you be my prey today?)
Blub-ub.
Blub-ub-ub!\n(No! You beat me at my own game!)
Bloop... Bloop-oop...\n(Elapsed time: 20 minutes, 14 seconds.)
Bloop-oop...
Bloop bloop-oop...\n(That’s about as long as I can hold my breath.)
I’m not into this costume. I’m a Dragon Tamer,\nthough, so I have to wear it!
Uhh... It’s all a misunderstanding.
The Dragon Tamer uniform aims to appear prestigious.\c\nThere are more than a few Trainers who have quit\nbeing Dragon-type users because of their dislike of it.
My muscles are trying to tell me something.\nThey want me to battle you!
My muscles are crying.
After I strengthened my core muscles to\nthe max, I became able to hear their voice!
This mural apparently depicts\nevents in ancient Hoenn.
I learned a lot from that.
The study of history is just the\nsame as the study of people.
I was headed to the Contest Spectacular Hall,\nbut I seem to have lost my way.
What was that?!
I’m going to appear in the Contest Spectacular!\nMy Pokémon and I are on our way to the big time!
I’m looking for Pokémon as\nlong as I’m out here hiking.
I didn’t even want to battle.
Maybe there aren’t many\ngood Pokémon around here.

I’ve no time for idle talk.\nLet us see your conviction.
Your conviction could even crush rock.
No words should be\nspoken by the defeated.
Your luck is about to run out!\nYour fate is to fall before me!
No!
Uhn...\c\nEven if they weren’t quite cool, I delivered\nmy lines awesomely, if I do say so myself.
You look all right for a kid.\nI can totally get into this!
I underestimated you!
You’re really awesome! I dig you!\nWhy don’t you become one of my buddies?
Dragon types are the strongest Pokémon!\nI’ll prove that with the likes of you!
Y-you...
You handle yourself quite well.\nI’ll let you be my rival!
Don’t come any closer!\nMy big sister is all mine!
Stop it.\nDon’t get too close to her!
Scall: Hey, are you OK, Sis?!\nIon: ...Scall...
I don’t hate strong Trainers, so\nwe could battle again sometime.\c\nMy big sister is all mine, though!\nYou can’t have her, no matter\r\nhow many times you come for her!
I must admit that you have power.\c\nBut I must warn you...\nYou mustn’t get too close to her.
No way! I hate being alone!\nI need my big sister!
Not a chance.\nI can’t leave my sister alone.
Are you trying to take my big sister away again?\nMy big sister and I will be together here for all eternity!
You...\nCould you...\c\nCould you be after Scall, too?
Scall: Hang in there, Sis!\nIon: ...Scall...
It doesn’t matter how many times you come\nback! My big sister is mine and mine alone!
Not a chance.\nI can’t leave Scall’s side...
I absolutely hate being all alone!\nMy big sister and I battle together!
No way.\nI can’t leave my sister alone.
I’ll give you something nice!\nJust don’t go near my big sister!
Take this.\nNow stop trying to get close to my sister.
Do you think you can win against we sisters who have\nbeen brought together by the greatness of Fairy magic?
We sisters, having been brought together by the\ngreatness of a Ghost curse, are the strongest...
Elle: No! The spell was broken!\nAya: Oh... The curse was lifted...
All right, time to stop playing sisters!\nLet’s play again sometime, Trainer!
This girl lives in my neighborhood.\nDealing with children is really tiring.
What?! You don’t have enough Pokémon!\nI only do Double Battles!
Apparently this girl wants a Double Battle.\nEven one is enough, just bring more Pokémon.
Oh! You’re the first Trainer\nwe’ve met since we teamed up!\c\nWe’re what you call Brains & Brawn.\nWe’ll do our utmost!
All right! You’re the first Trainer we’ve\nmet since we formed our team!\c\nWe’re Brains & Brawn.\nGet ready, ’cause here we come!
Jael: Thank you very much!\nKael: We learned a lot from you!
Wow! You sure are a strong Trainer!\nPlease let us be your apprentices!
Amazing! I sure was impressed!\nPlease! Let me call you my master!
Sorry, but we’re a team.\nPlease give us a Double Battle.
We want to make our way doing Double Battles.\nPlease don’t subject us to one-on-one battles.
Good morning, master!\nPlease bestow your wisdom upon us!
Master! Good morning!\nPlease watch our performance again!
Jael: Thank you very much, master!\nKael: Master, thank you very much!
Master, you’re a real genius!\c\nBecoming a Trainer like you,\nmaster, is our goal as a team!
Thank you so much for everything, master!\c\nI always learn so much from you!\nPlease continue to teach me from here on out!
Sorry. I sure am sorry...\c\nEven if it’s an order from you,\nmaster, I can’t battle alone.\c\nWe want to battle on as a team!
Please be patient with us, master.\c\nEven though it’s an order from you,\nmaster, I can’t battle alone.\c\nPlease let me battle with my teammate!
Master! This is to thank you for your wisdom!\nIt is only a trifle, but please accept it!
Master! Please take this!\c\nIt may be shabby, but it’s to express\nmy gratitude for your wisdom!
Hey! Some Trainer came up and started\ntalking to me! Go on, you attack first!
Hey! There’s some Trainer talking to me!\nYou attack first, just like we planned it!
Aden: It’s all your fault!\nFinn: Pull yourself together!
Sorry that other guy messed things up.\nHe’s not used to Double Battles.\r\n(I might not be either...)
I’m really sorry we were so disgraceful.\nThe other guy’s still just a beginner.\r\n(I actually might be, too...)
It’s quite difficult for me to say this,\nbut we’d like to have a Double Battle.
Well, we’re a team called Brains & Brawn\nthat specializes in Double Battles.
Thank you for coming, challenger.\c\nAs a servant of the Trick Master,\nI pierce through everything like a spear!
Welcome, challenger!\c\nAs a servant of the Trick Master,\nI will repel all attacks like a shield!
Pike: Master...\nShiel: Master...
I am a servant of the Trick Master.\nAt least as long as he pays me...
I am a servant of the Trick Master!\nEven if I am just a seasonal worker!
If you wish to battle us servants of the\nTrick Master, you’ll need more Pokémon.
If you wish to battle us servants of the\nTrick Master, prepare for a Double Battle!
Hmmph. You’re a cute Trainer.\nI wonder how long you can hold out against my attack.
We’re an invincible combination.\nWe’ll be burned into your memory!
Jude: Ugh... What happened?\nRory: I’m so terribly sorry, m’lady!
It...can’t end like this.\nLet’s meet again someday.
Not all teammates are necessarily equals.\nI’m a loyal underling of this fair lady.\c\nIt was certainly my mistake that\ncaused us to lose the previous battle.\c\nIn other words, a punishment of\nlong, hard training awaits me.
Oh, that’s too bad.\nWe’re Double Battle Trainers.
Sorry, but if you want to battle with us,\nyou’re going to need more Pokémon.
It has been too long, Trainer.\nWe won’t lose this time.
I’m going to burn the fruits of\nmy training into your memory!
Jude: Ugh! What an awful mistake!\nRory: Are you all right, m’lady?!
I won’t give up just yet.\nLet’s meet again someday.
Not all teammates are necessarily equals.\nI’m a loyal underling of this fair lady.\c\nHowever, since we began battling you,\nmy mistress has placed more trust in me.\c\nAt the same time, the training I do as punishment\nhas gotten harder and harder, too. Tee-hee.
Have you forgotten?\nWe’re Double Battle Trainers.
Hey, what’s the matter with you?\nYou don’t have enough Pokémon to battle.
I accept my defeat.\nTake this as proof of your victory.
Let me thank you for a fine battle.\nPlease take this with you.
Glub...glub...glub...\n(Battles everywhere! That’s what it is to be a Trainer!)
Glu-u-u-ub.
Glub...glub...\c\n(No matter where I go,\nbattles are always the same.)
Gla-glub! Glub! Glu-glub!\n(Target sighted! I’ll take ’em down!)
Glub!
Gla-glub! Glub! Glub!\n(I feel like swimming down to the\r\ndepths I’m so embarrassed!)
Bloop...bloop-oop...bloop...\n(Hey, have you heard of marine snow?)
Bloop...
Bloop-oop...bloop...\n(Marine snow is proof of the sea’s abundance.)
Blub! Blub-ub!\n(I’m looking for things that fell here.)
Blub-ub!
Blub-ub! Blub-ub-ub!\n(I can’t find anything.)
Hmmph!\nThat’s one of Rydel’s Bikes!
I expected no less from one who can\nhandle a Bike produced by Rydel!
Mach Bikes and Acro Bikes...\c\nKnowing you, you’d be able to handle\neither one with no problem at all!
My role here is to test all the future\nTriathletes who come to Cycling Road.
You’re qualified to ride all the\nway to the end of Cycling Road!
Please enjoy riding all around on this\ncrazy huge Cycling Road to your heart’s content!
[~ 2701]
The chair is fading away...
[~ 2703]
[~ 2704]
It’s a harsh world...
[~ 2706]
[~ 2707]
No way! No, no, no!
[~ 2709]
[~ 2710]
It couldn’t be helped...
[~ 2712]
[~ 2713]
May I curse you?
[~ 2715]
[~ 2716]
OK, I’ll let you win.
[~ 2718]
[~ 2719]
You really did it, didn’t you?!
[~ 2721]
[~ 2722]
Not like this...
[~ 2724]
[~ 2725]
What tenacity...
[~ 2727]
[~ 2728]
How careless of me...
[~ 2730]
[~ 2731]
Ugh...
[~ 2733]
[~ 2734]
You know no fear.
[~ 2736]
[~ 2737]
No wonder even my big bro can’t win.
[~ 2739]
[~ 2740]
You did it, didn’t you?
[~ 2742]
[~ 2743]
Sorry, Uncle.
[~ 2745]
[~ 2746]
What...
[~ 2748]
[~ 2749]
Who do you think you are?!
[~ 2751]
[~ 2752]
I can’t change the fact that I lost.
[~ 2754]
[~ 2755]
...
[~ 2757]
[~ 2758]
Uhhngh...
[~ 2760]
[~ 2761]
I give! I give!\nWhoa! You’re crazy strong for a kid!
[~ 2763]
[~ 2764]
Well, it’s not like I coulda beat you by\ngettin’ just a little bit stronger, right?
[~ 2766]
Yes! That’s it!\nThat’s just what I was looking for!
To defeat me, a descendant of the ancient Sootopolis\npeople, and even when I was holding nothing back...
Yet another defeat!
Even though I knew I wouldn’t win,\nit’s still disappointing!
I’m so hungry...
Yet another defeat!
Even though I knew I wouldn’t win,\nit’s still disappointing!
I’m so hungry...
S-so strong!
Are you telling me you’re that\nstrong and still just a kid?!
That’s just too strong, right?!
Your strength is no joke!\nThat made me dizzy.
You’re crazy strong, just like always...
I knew I wouldn’t win, but...
I’m Amy!\nThis is my sister, Liv!\r\nWe battle together!
The two of us together make one!\nWe always battle together!
Amy: I’m disappointed.\nWe couldn’t win.\c\nLiv: We lost again, Sis.
Taking on two opponents\nat once makes you think!
My sister and I were breathing\nperfectly in sync, though.\c\nWhy did we lose, again?
Huh? You only brought one Pokémon with you!\nYou can’t battle us like that!
If you want to battle us, you have to\nbring at least two Pokémon!\r\nWe can’t have a battle otherwise!
Here, Trainer!\nI’m disappointed, but thanks for the battle!
Here you go, Trainer!\nI’m disappointed, but thanks for the battle!
Well, well, I lose again!
I expected no less of you!
It really is hot.
Spectacular!
Phew...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nPlease see how much my training has accomplished!\nThis time my team is the best it can be!
Gaaahhh!
Hah...hah...\c\nMaybe I need to start again from scratch.\c\nBut you performed as well as I’d expect, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou even beat the best team I could put together!\c\nAnd, well, Pokémon battling really is great, isn’t it?\c\nWhen I get to spend every day training and battling\nlike this, I really can’t help thinking, so...\r\nI enjoy every day so much that I really think I finally\r\nfound where I belong.\c\nI...I’m going to keep getting stronger!\nSo please battle with me again!
Hah...hah...\c\nHere, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nTake this, hah, with my thanks.
An intruder? In our hideout?! You’re pretty\nshady looking. On your mark, get set, fight!
Beaten at my own game!\nFor a second time!
You’re not an intruder?\nUh...sorry.\c\nI thought you were with that girl who was\nin here messing up our hideout earlier.
If you want to get to the Leader,\nyou’ll have to defeat me first.\c\nNot that you would have a chance\neven if the whole world went topsy-turvy!
It was my Pokémon and I who went all topsy-turvy!
What’s going on with you\nand that girl from earlier?\c\nI know teenagers can feel frustrated, but that’s\nno reason to go wrecking other people’s hideouts.\c\nWhat’s that? You’re not together?\nSorry about that.
Hey!\nYou’re that intruder who messed up our base!\r\nI’mma teach you a lesson!
I got taught! Heh heh.
Huh?\nYou’re not an intruder?\c\nS-sorry for the mistake...\c\nI thought you were with that weird lady\nwho was trashing our hideout earlier.
If you wanna get to Archie,\nyou gotta take me out first.\c\nYou’re years away from being\nable to beat me, though!
Perhaps my Pokémon and I are the ones\nwith years of training to do...
What’s going on with you\nand that girl from earlier?\c\nTeenagers are old enough to know\nthe difference between right and wrong!\c\nYou can’t go trashing somebody’s\nhideout on impulse!\c\nHuh?\nThat wasn’t you?!\c\nS-sorry about that.\nI apologize.
Heave-ho!\nBy fanning out, we spotted a suspicious person!
Fanning out doesn’t help you\nin Pokémon battles at all!
I hope you just keep going straight.\nI’m sure it’ll be fun... Tee hee.
Hey, hey, hey!\c\nFanning out has helped in spotting a suspicious person!
Fanning out has nothing at all to\ndo with winning Pokémon battles!
You should just keep going straight.\nI’m sure it’ll be a riot... Tee hee hee.
Just like I’d expected of you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
It’s no surprise!\nI hate to admit it, but you’re pretty strong!

Merci bien!
Aw, sh-shucks!
Don’t let your guard down, or you\nmay be crying when a kid beats you.
I may be young, but that doesn’t\nmean I’ll lose—even to a grown-up.
Sheesh! Can’t you see that I’m just a kid!\nIt wasn’t fair of you to go all out like that!
Let’s have a fun Pokémon battle!
Hehe! Mehehehehe!\nSee? It’s fun to win!
That was pretty amazingly fun!\nYou’ve totally exhausted me...

You’d better go easy on me, OK?\nThough I’ll be seriously fighting!
I can’t believe I won! Wait...\nDid you seriously go easy on me?
Hey! I told you to go easy on me!\nStill, you’re pretty cool when you’re serious.
Um, um, um, you know what?\nThese Pokémon are my friends.
I...I’m sorry. I just wanted\nto show you my friends...
Just being with my Pokémon\nmakes me happy, so it’s OK!

Heheh. Exactly as I planned...\nThere’s no way I would lose.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis\nare perhaps no match for chance...
We’re about to battle, but that doesn’t\nmean we can’t be polite! Good luck!
That could have gone better,\nbut I do thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration,\nbut I do thank you very much.
I’ve been studying every single day,\nso I’m taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon\nis fun. I want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost...\nMaybe I’ll stick to studying.
I want to be a Pokémon\nresearcher when I grow up.
Do you think Pokémon research\nprojects need any test subjects?
I must do my best to learn\neven more about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong...\nI hope I’ll be all right...
Oops, you weren’t as strong as I\nexpected. Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer!\nWhat you see is what you get, right?
I always get the best grades!\nI aim to be number one in everything!
I will keep winning and winning\nand winning... I will be number one!
If I lose at such an early\nstage, I can’t be number one...
Wha—? You wanna battle with me?\nI suppose we could arrange something...
Ah, I shoulda known.\nHey, don’t blame me.
Oh, wh-whoa. I’m no match for you.\nYour Pokémon are somethin’ else.
Grumble, grumble...
Grumble, grumble...\nHuh? Did I win?
Grumble, grumble...\nOh? Was that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe,\na mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell.\nI’m worried about your future, kid.
I really let myself get carried away this time.\nI hope it doesn’t affect my future prospects.
Are you my opponent?\nYou look kind of hungry.
Hmm. Have you been eating well?\nCan’t fight on an empty stomach!
Are you sure you’re normal?\nWhat in the world do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity,\nso I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you’ve lost to me.\nNow, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won’t give\nyou my lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon.\nI don’t think they’ll lose to you.
You see that? I’ll be fine as\nlong as I listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mama-a-a! Waaah!\nMake the mean Trainer go away!
Ahhh, a Trainer who looks gorgeous!\nI hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost to me?!\nI’m a little disappointed.
Oh my, our battle was just as\ngorgeous. I feel drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you\nlike? Hey, come on, show me!
Your taste in Pokémon is wonderful, but\nyou are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful,\nbut you are a first-class Trainer!
I’m sorry—I’ve been lying.\nI’m not really a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to\nme when I pretended to be rich.
The truth is that I’m nothing more\nthan the daughter of a Clerk ♂.
Ahahaha!
Ahahaha!!!
Ahaha-argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you!\nOh yeah! Nice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna!\nTank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost!\nTank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler!\nI’m already prepping for college.
You lost to a Preschooler...\nAnd how old are you again?
I’m confident in studying, but I’m\njust a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am the hero!\nI refuse to lose!
I AM the hero!\nI beat a villain!
A hero never loses.\nA hero never dies.
I am very strong.\nI will never lose.
Daddy gave me my Pokémon!\nThey’ve gotta be the strongest!
WAAAH!
No pouting when you lose,\n’cause that’s just lame.
I’m so happy, I could c-cry!\nYip-yip-yippeee!
Awww, s-sniff! I losted on my battle...\nIt’s sad, but I s’pose it’s my fault.
Are you gonna pick on me?
You didn’t pick on me.\nSo I guess I like you!
You did pick on me, after all, but\nI like you ’cause you’re strong!
Game on, Pokémon!\nGive it all you’ve got!

Booooo! Come on,\nPokémon! Try harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best!\nTrainer, you should do your best, too!
I’m four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you were really weak.
I’m four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nI am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nDrifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nTill we meet again...
I am not just an ordinary Backpacker,\n’cause I’m also a newlywed, you see!
My new wife and I are hitchhiking for our\nhoneymoon, ’cause we have no money.
This is my honeymoon! B-but...\nBut I’ve lost my wife somewhere...
Hitchhiking around the region without\na cent to your name has its own charm.
See? Travel is best when\nyou’re young and poor.
Argh... I’m so hungry...\nCan you please spare something...
It’s no holds barred on this\njourney! Where’s my adventure?!
My journey... No, my adventure of\na lifetime hasn’t even begun yet!
The journey isn’t over. Just you wait!\nI’ll show you the greatest adventure ever!
The truth is that I’m a time traveler.\nI just popped by from the future.
Even if I lose, I can just jump in my time machine\nand go back to the past to try a battle again!
Yes, traveling through time...\nThat’s how I go!
You know, the prices in this region are\nreally quite something, aren’t they!
Though the level of the Trainers in this region...\nWell, they’re nothing worth writing home about.
I couldn’t possibly live in a country\nwhere everything costs so much!
Sometimes I need a little time to rest.\nI’m gonna take it easy this battle, OK?
That was a nice and easy win.\nI’ll work hard again tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing,\nbut now I feel more stressed out.
All I want is to work hard, save\nmy money, and live a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream.\nI just want to have a normal life.
I’d rather simply have security and\nhappiness than chase a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! I’ve got some real\nplump and lively Pokémon right here!
What do you think of my Pokémon?\nThey’re fresh!
Thanks for coming! What’d you think?\nDid my Pokémon suit your tastes?
Didn’t you come here for a Pokémon battle?
Don’t be scared, or you will never win.
You are a strong Trainer.\nForgive my impertinence.
Hiya, honey! Welcome, welcome!\nHave you decided what you’ll have?
Order up! One humiliation in\na Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory in\na Pokémon battle, sunny-side up.
Meow, meow, I can haz battle, meow?\n(Ugh, I really sound like a fool, don’t I?)
Yeah! Meow! I haz victory, meow!\n(I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I haz lost, meowww.\n(This job is sooo embarrassing.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than\nanybody else’s. Love can do anything.
This victory proves my\ntrue love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love\nshould’ve helped me win...right?
Oh, do you want to see the\nPokémon I am proudest of?
What do you think about my \ndear Pokémon? Great, right?
Oh my goodness! My poor Pokémon...
Here I go! I battle for the\nhonor of the branch office!
I am a branch manager of the\nPokémon Fan Club—and I won!
Urk! F-farewell for now!\nI’ll remember this, child!
I lost a lot of things because\nI love Pokémon too much...
I have devoted my life to Pokémon.\nI see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my\ndevotion. What shall I do?!
Listen, I love Pokémon more\nthan life itself!
I’ll be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too!\nPlease, let me pet them!
I’m not good at battling, but this\nis one of the duties of a Poké Fan.
I’ve kept the honor of the\nPoké Fan alive. Hahaha!
Cheers, all you Poké Fans out there!\nMay the Poké Fan last forever!
My middle-age spread has given me as\nmuch gravitas as the mountains I hike!
Bwahaha! You’ll win, too, if you\njust up your calorie intake a bit!
At least I cannot lose\nwhen it comes to BMI!
I am no mere Hiker.\nCall me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me\nis properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous\nmatters. That’s an alpinist.
I’m bursting with dreams and desires!\nI’m just a bundle of youthful vigor!
Dreams are important!\nDesires are important!
I’m so full of dreams and desires that I’m about\nto burst! But that’s what it means to be young!
Is it really OK? Do you really think\nsomeone like me can be a Trainer?
No way... I’m actually pretty good!\nOr are you just a total amateur?
Ahhh... I knew I’d be terrible at it...\nI can’t call myself a Trainer like this...
Anyone can stay young if they keep stars\nin their eyes and dreams in their hearts!
I won’t tell you how old I really am, but I\ncan say I’m old enough to be your mother!
All you have to do is ignore reality,\nand you can stay young forever, too.
If it’s cute, fluffy Pokémon\nyou want, leave it to me!
A harmony of strength and cuteness...\nThat’s what I’m all about!
A fragile ephemerality...\nYes, that’s another of my charms...
My dear cuties whisper all kinds of secrets to me...
You see?\nMy cuties teach me all kinds of good things.
Why don’t my cuties say anything?\nWhy do they seem in such a bad temper?
I won’t be going easy on you just\nbecause you’re a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You can’t do battle\nif you’re afraid of losing.
Harrumph. I’m still weak.\nI pity my Pokémon...
I may be bad and stupid, but\nI’m serious about Pokémon.
I only really feel at peace\nwhen I’m with Pokémon.
I hope you’ll find something\nyou can be serious about.
My amazing punk hair is\nthe secret to my power.
The more I spike my hair,\nthe stronger I am!
If you want to be even stronger, you\nshould get amazing punk hair, too! 
What d’you think you’re lookin’ at?!\nYou’ve got some kind of nerve, kid!
A hard chick like me doesn’t need anybody else\nto fight! My Pokémon are all the backup I need!
Amazin’! I got schooled from here to Hoenn!\nYou gotta take me under your wing, boss!
I’m Callisto, the boss of the Kalos Coalition.\nIt’d be my pleasure to take you on in battle!
Phew... You’ve got some good\nPokémon on your side, all right.
Well, ain’t you something... All right, then.\nI’m stepping down—you’re the new boss!
The guy I like is, like, totally bad...\nI’m gonna be real bad for that cad...
The gals of the Kalos region, like yeah...\nOoh, ooh, ooh, we battle, ooh yeah...
Gals of Kalos don’t take it on the chin...\nOoh, ooh, ooh, you’ll regret this win...
Non, non! A dash of defeat is not called\nfor in my recipe book! C’est pas possible!
Ouais! Where is the life? Where is the vigor?\nIt would not even tempt a half-starved Skitty!
Bon sang! What spice! What kick you have!\nYou must tell me your secret ingredient!
S-so you’ve come to challenge me!\nGet too close, and I will sauté you!
It...it...it’s all your fault for challenging me!\nNext time I’ll turn you into a tasty concasse!
Stop! Just hold on a moment!\nI don’t want to be flambéed!
In the land of feasting, I am king!\nNay, I am the Emperor of Eating!
Ahhh, the Emperor of Eating is satiated!\nI polished off your Pokémon in no time!
I-I give up my seat as Emperor of Eating...\nTake care of my precious land of feasting...
Wanna give me a hand with my training?\nIt’s all for the sake of my future dreams!
Your defeat is another small step\ntoward my dreams coming true!
What! B-b-but my future... Have you seriously\nconsidered what defeat will do to my future?!
Talent? Hah! It’s just a convenient excuse\nlazy Trainers use to explain away their losses.
Talent is not something that can be gained,\nand strength grows weak if it is not used.
So-called talent is no more than an illusion...\nThe efforts of one’s own are all that is real.
In the words of an ancient warrior, “Conquer\nthe self, and you will conquer the opponent.”
What do you wish to do now? Shall I\nleave and relieve you of your shame?
Ahhhh! What a crock! If I can’t even conquer\nyou, then who cares about conquering myself?!
I’m gonna give it my all. It’s only natural!\nYou can only get results by doing battle!
How does it feel to lose?\nObviously, I wouldn’t know.
Whether you give it your all or slack off...\nAll that matters in the end is who wins...
Hmph! I’m no servant of yours!
No one but my master\nwill ever make me bow!
U-ugh... Rather strong, aren’t you?\nI suppose I might not mind serving you...
Are your preparations complete?\nI would like to ask you for a battle.
A strength equal to that of my master...\nI look forward to your future progress.
Oh no, what a disgrace! I’m sure my\nmaster will dock my pay for this.
The master I was serving disappeared one day.\nNow I am a masterless Butler—a ronin retainer!
Oh, Master, where art thou?
A Butler without a master is really no\nmore than a meddlesome old man.
Oh no! I forgot to take off\nmy uniform before I came!
Wow! Seriously? I won a battle?!\nThere’s no way I’m going back now!
Ahhhhh! And I lost!\nThis is not my day.
You know, I am very popular\nthanks to this costume of mine.
Being popular is simple.\nI like life to be simple.
It feels good to be popular, but\nsometimes I feel achingly empty.
Welcome, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0908)]good sirfair lady. Shall I\ntake your coat for you?
You must be tired.\nPlease do rest awhile.
That was superb, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss!\nYou are strong indeed.
I used to be popular, but\nnow I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success. I took\nit for granted, and I didn’t work hard.
As times change, values also\nchange. I realized that too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses.\nIf you lose, I hope you’ll model for me.
I’ll do a sketch of you as you are now,\nfrustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait! I’m sure I can create a\nmasterpiece with you as my model!
Sensitivity is important for battles,\ntoo. You! Start feeling right now!
You need to feel it more!\nMore! Or you’ll never win!
Ah! I sense it! I sense your\nhypersensitive sensitivity!
Action painting? That’s, like, so last\ncentury. Art today is all about inaction.
Inaction doesn’t mean do nothing! Did you hug\nan Electrode with the Static Ability or something?
Inaction may be the rage for art, but maybe\nit’s not such a great strategy for battling...
Inspiration... I need inspiration...\nSomeone, please, inspire me!
Ah! My muse! She has not abandoned me!\nI can feel it coming—the inspiration I need!
Hah... Hah... No, not yet!\nI still need more inspiration!
I dabbled in art like I dabble in Pokémon!\nDabbling is what keeps me from the rabble!
Hee hee hee! That was quite the scrabble!\nEven if you weren’t very good, I still enjoyed it!
You may think I’m just babbling,\nbut I sure love my artistic dabbling!
I’ll show you we can break you.\nWe’ve been training in the field!
How were my Pokémon?\nPowerful, weren’t they?
How strange... How could this be...\nI shouldn’t have been outmuscled.
Oh, you look lively!\nWhat d’ya say we battle?
OK! We’re all done here!\nHow were my partners?
My goodness, you are so young!\nMy partners were crushed!
Pokémon battles after work\nare the one joy in my life.
Ahhhhhhhhh! Yes, that hits the spot!\nThis is why I can’t give up Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh... You got me good!\nI’m single... Battling is my only pleasure in life.
Pokémon are popular at work, too.\nEven us guys enjoy these battles!
Aren’t I good for a guy who just\nbattles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both\nenjoy battling with Pokémon.
I’ve trained and trained myself without stopping,\nso now I’m as fast as the wind!
No one can stop me now that\nI’m as fast as the wind itself!
Ow! Ow! Ow! My face!\nI’m the poster child for windburn!
I pledge myself now to the great roller spirits!\nMy love, my hopes, my vow... It’s all for you!
It’s like some sort of dream.\nShall I embrace this, too, great roller spirits?
Skates alive! What a battle!
Who was it?! Who’s the bad-mouther who\nsaid that I’m just barely skating by, huh?!
I would never just skate by in battle!\nEven if I am wearing Roller Skates!
I-I can’t even skate by anymore?\nThat’s it... I’m done. I’m retiring.
I’ve skated all the way here today!\nOver fields, mountains, and valleys!
That’s right! If you only have a pair of\nRoller Skates, you can go anywhere!
Hah... Hah... All that skating...\nIt really took it...out of me...
Halt, fool! I am the guardian of this\ncastle’s gardens! A ninja of nature!
Bwahahahah! My Pokémon’s\nninja skills are without equal!
Gasp! What maliciousness was in that move?!\nI see. So you must also be a ninja...
Stop! I’m going to have to ask you not to move.\nJust sit back and see what I do with my shears!
What a shame. It looks like I’ve dulled my\nprecious pruning shears on an ordinary weed.
You have shown quite the cutting prowess...\nI shall sharpen my shears to face you again.
If you don’t have great Pokémon, you’ll never\nhave a great battle.
It seems like you don’t even understand\nhow great your Pokémon could be.
It looks like I didn’t properly appreciate how\ngreat my own Pokémon could have been...
My last ever battle...\nThat’s the way I’d like us to view this match...
We will meet again someday...\nHeh. If only that were true...
It’s been fun...\nLet’s have another last battle again someday...
My disciples cover the world!\nI am the owningest of Owners!
I can own any Owners, after all.\nI can’t be defeated that easily.
Sacre bleu! As of this day, you’ve\nowned the Owner of all Owners!
Having carte blanche only leads to disaster.\nNo, I was never well suited to be an Owner.
Victory is a shallow and fleeting illusion. \nYour eventual defeat is a fait accompli.
They say with age comes wisdom, but\nthat never seems to have worked for me.
Adults have learned a lot of things kids don’t get.\nLike what is right...and what is fair...
Let me guess... You spend a lot of time blaming\nadults for things you think aren’t “fair,” don’t you?
Getting older is a one-way ticket.\nI regret nothing!
I’ve recently remade my life completely!\nI’ve been reborn as a Beauty at last!
If you want to make your dreams reality, then you\nhave to be completely dedicated!
Yes, a mere half year ago I was a Black Belt!\nQuite the transformation, wouldn’t you say?
It’s only the first day of my honeymoon\ntrip...and I’m already missing home.
Enough already! I just want to\ngo home! I miss my mother!
Sob... Sob... Who needs this?\nI’m going home to my mother!
Are you lost here? Are you lost here?\nBrother John, Brother John.
Winning bells are ringing, winning bells are ringing.\nDing ding dong! Ding ding dong!
Now my head is ringing, now my head is ringing.\nDing ding dong! Ding ding dong!
It’s my honeymoon! I’m on my honeymoon!\nI’m definitely not a crazy lady traveling alone!
A-and I’m on my honeymoon, you got that?!\nThat’s the most important point to remember!
I-I’ve got a husband... No, really, I do...\nBecause this is my honeymoon...see?
Hoard your money, then spend it all shopping!\nWe’re making the economy move here, people!
If you don’t work, you can’t shop till you drop!\nI work hard so I can waste my money like this!
Though I guess I should\nprobably be buying local...
A true Monsieur should\nhave a liking for battles.
A true Monsieur should bask in\nthe elegant glow of his victory.
A true Monsieur should accept the\nresults of battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of a Poké Fan.
You can learn much from a mature woman,\nsuch as wisdom, grace, and good manners.
Woo-hoo! Take that! Were you knocked\nout by this Madame’s charm, or what?!
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Ah-roo! Let us have an\nelegant and unique battle.
Ah-roo-goo-lah! I was not confident of \nmy skills, so this is a delightful surprise.
Ooh la la! I’ll pay you back for this someday!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon...\nPokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your\nPokémon, even if you lose a battle.
It is important to nurture and train\neach Pokémon’s characteristics.
Hmm, do you discipline your Pokémon?\nPampering them too much is no good.
No matter how much you love your Pokémon, you\nstill have to discipline them when they misbehave.
Too much praise can spoil\nboth Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you. They\nreturn all the love you give them.
This proves my Pokémon\nhave accepted my love.
It’s about time for me to give\na human my affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for\ntraining good Pokémon?
The real trick behind training good\nPokémon is catching good Pokémon.
You don’t seem to need any tips\nfor training good Pokémon.

O-oh! Fair play!\nYou’re quite strong, aren’t you, guest!\c\nNow that I’ve seen how strong you are, \nI feel I shouldn’t have held back.\c\nIt’s just that my elder sisters had asked me\nto take it a bit easy on new guests...\c\nThe next time that we battle, I will try\nmuch harder to beat you!\c\nP-please continue to patronize the Battle Maison...\nAnd to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison!\nI’m Dana. Thank you for coming.\c\nI am the second eldest of the four sisters who run\nthis Battle Maison.\c\nI am also a Triple Battle expert!\c\nSo come at me, young challenger!\nYes, the extent of your strength...\c\nI will be weighing it in a moment!
My, my, my... What a pity.\nIs that the end of things for you?\c\nI thought you had potential, but you\ncan’t get blood from a stone, after all.\c\nAway with you! I’m not interested in wasting time\nwith weak Trainers!\c\nIf that’s difficult for you to accept, come back\nand dare to challenge me again.\c\nAnd if you’re just going to give up, then why not\njust run home now to lick your wounds in shame?
Gasp...gasp...\nThat was quite...the performance...\c\nTruly...\c\nYou and your Pokémon...are truly...\c\nEhh, leave it out! Let’s drop the act.\c\nGood [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]ladgirl, yourself. That’s the best trouncin’ \nI’ve had in ages. Sure, in ages!\c\nIn fairness, I put on a bit of a show for the guests.\c\nBut I can’t act so high ’n’ mighty\nafter a savage battle like that one.\c\nNow, you leg it this instant before \nI consider fighting ye again right now!\c\nAway ye go and keep on winning!\c\n’Cause if ye do...\nI’ll show ye my real skills.\c\nYe’d do well to mind yerself then!
If you’re free for a time, come on by. ♪\nIf you’re bored for a while, stop on in. ♪\r\nBattle till you burst, oh, won’t you try. ♪\r\nIf you want to battle, the Battle Maison’s fine. ♪\c\nHee! What do you think of our song, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0C06)]my ladyoung missie?\nWe had it written just for our wee Battle Maison.\c\nMusic can be a lovely distraction.\nDon’t you agree?\c\nOh, me. I’ve not even introduced myself,\nhave I?

Thank you for the battle, love!\nDid you have a bit of fun yourself?\c\nGet out of the garden! I had no idea you were\nsuch a fine Trainer!\c\nIt’s not just that you’re fearsome strong, \nthough you are, of course.\c\nYou have real style to you, too!

Welcome to the Battle Maison![WAIT 30]\nI’m Dana. Thank you for coming.[WAIT 30]\c\nI am the second eldest of the four sisters who run[WAIT 30]\nthis Battle Maison.[WAIT 30]\c\nI will praise your bravery, at least, in attempting[WAIT 30]\na Multi Battle with me![WAIT 30]\c\nAnd, of course, I am hardly alone![WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nOh, give me a break, Evelyn![WAIT 30]\nIt’s your line next!

Evelyn?[WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nOh, for pity’s sake, Evelyn! Wake up![WAIT 30]\nI’m morto for them and you! Honest!
Dana: Ugh...[WAIT 30]\nYou’re not bad, that’s for certain...[WAIT 30]\c\nTo think that you would be able to break through[WAIT 30]\nour perfect combo...[WAIT 30]\c\nBut my real stage is the Triple Battle![WAIT 30]\c\nAnd Evelyn’s speciality is Double Battle![WAIT 30]\c\nIf you took either of us on in our own specialties,[WAIT 30]\nwe’d never lose to you![WAIT 30]\c\nIsn’t that right, Evelyn?!
I-I-I’m sorry, Dana...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um, my name is Evelyn...[WAIT 30]\nI-I-I’m usually in charge of Double Battles...[WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um...so...well...[WAIT 30]\c\nI’m not all flash like my sister Dana when it comes[WAIT 30]\nto talking...[WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-umm!

Evelyn: Huh?

Evelyn: Wh-wha... Well, I never said...[WAIT 30]\c\nI-I don’t really think I’m all that good at[WAIT 30]\nDouble Battles either...[WAIT 30]\c\nA-and the reason that we just lost was because[WAIT 30]\nI’m so slow...[WAIT 30]\c\nS-so I don’t think these guests should expect[WAIT 30]\nmuch from me...[WAIT 30]\c\nI’d look a bit silly... Please...[WAIT 30]\nPick anything but Double Battle...[WAIT 30]\c\nN-now then... I’ll excuse myself...[WAIT 30]\nThank you for the battle...
W-w-welcome...[WAIT 30]\nTo the B-Battle Maison...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um...[WAIT 30]\c\nWe would like to thank you...for choosing a[WAIT 30]\nMulti Battle today...[WAIT 30]\c\nS-so...um...[WAIT 30]\c\nYou will be facing my elder sister Morgan[WAIT 30]\nand me, Evelyn, today...
Evelyn: Th-th-thank you very much![WAIT 30]\c\nY-your Pokémon were brilliant![WAIT 30]\c\nI-I will also work hard, so you’ll never be stuck[WAIT 30]\nfor a challenge...[WAIT 30]\c\nSo please...[WAIT 30]\nCome to visit us at the Battle Maison again...
Evelyn: Um, fair play, you two![WAIT 30]\nYou were both so very strong![WAIT 30]\c\nTh-the truth is I was nervous facing two strangers[WAIT 30]\nat the same time.[WAIT 30]\c\nSo I don’t know what I did...[WAIT 30]\c\nB-but I will try even harder the next time that we[WAIT 30]\nhave a Multi Battle...[WAIT 30]\c\nSo please d-do definitely ask me to join you[WAIT 30]\nin a Multi Battle again.
Evelyn?

Oh! Were you earwigging?[WAIT 30]\c\nWhat a cheeky bit you are![WAIT 30]\c\nI should not have been discussing[WAIT 30]\npersonal matters in front a guest.[WAIT 30]\c\nL-let’s just get straight to the battle, shall we?[WAIT 30]\nAnd not before time![WAIT 30]\c\nEvelyn and I will do our very best,[WAIT 30]\nthough we’re both quite hopeless at this!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you two![WAIT 30]\nDid you enjoy our wee little combo?[WAIT 30]\c\nI’ve two other younger sisters, sure, in addition to[WAIT 30]\nmy shy Evelyn here.[WAIT 30]\c\nIf you happen to meet either of them, I trust they’ll[WAIT 30]\nshow you a good time.[WAIT 30]\c\nWe’ll all be looking forward to your next visit then![WAIT 30]\nDon’t work too hard!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you![WAIT 30]\nDid you enjoy our little combo?[WAIT 30]\c\nOur Evelyn is quite reserved, so she gets a wee bit[WAIT 30]\nnervous in these big battles.[WAIT 30]\c\nBut she’d take you on handily in a Double Battle![WAIT 30]\nI hope you’ll claim a Double Battle with her soon.[WAIT 30]\c\nAnd of course I’d be tickled meself to see you in[WAIT 30]\none of my Rotation Battles.[WAIT 30]\c\nWe’ll all be looking forward to your next visit, then![WAIT 30]\nDon’t work too hard!
Glad you made it! It won’t\nbe an easy job from here.
Haha! What’d I tell ya?\nYou’re not ready yet.
I got a little carried away earlier,\nbut what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and my dad are\nAce Trainers. I’m probably an Ace, too!
I want to be a real Ace\nlike my mom and dad.
Waaah! I should have superior genes and\nbe able to ride on my parents’ coattails...
I don’t mind your lack of focus, but you\nwill get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see? You didn’t focus on\nthe battle. That’s why you lost.
That’s quite enough focusing.\nStop staring at me like that!
Father... Mother...\nWatch over my battle...
Father... Mother... Did you see?\nI won a battle... I really won!
Father... Mother...\nWhat should I do?
I came here to goof off. I don’t\nwant to cram for the big test...
I can’t lose now... I don’t\nwant to study anymore!
No! I don’t want to go home!\nI don’t want to have to study!
I just want to be successful\nand grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday\nand put you to shame.
I don’t care who you are\nor where you come from.
How should we act and react?\nThat is all that matters, isn’t it?
A label is not important, is it?\nAfter all, you are yourself, right?
Pokémon battles and study sessions\nare much the same. Let’s be efficient!
You are too inefficient. You need\nto be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such\na slacker? I can’t believe it!
I have more money than I know what\nto do with. There’s nothing I really want.
The only thing I enjoy\nis a Pokémon battle...
Just because I’m rich, it\ndoesn’t mean I’m happy.
Yes! I’m a Rich Boy!
Good-bye! You’ve been\nbeaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci bien!\nYou’ve beat a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun,\nbut I’ll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance.\nPlease don’t pay it any mind.
It’s good to battle for fun. If it’s\ntoo serious, you won’t enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a\nbattle. I’m rich—I always have fun!
I’ve never done a day of work,\nbecause I’m loaded with cash.
No work and all play makes me a dull\ngirl. Do you think I don’t know that?
Go, my precious Pokémon!\nTo battle! Rush the enemy!
My Pokémon are the mightiest!\nI shall carve my name in history!
I won’t cry... I won’t.\nSomeday, I will win.
I came here for my big brother\nwho always hides in his room.
My big brother, look outside for once!\nI won for you! So come out and play!
I wish my big brother would come\nout of his room and play with me...
Hello, me old china,\ntime for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and\nwrite, Trainer, many clinks!
Even though I lost, I’ll be\nfine. Best of luck, Trainer!
All Mom and Dad do is mumble\nat their computers! It’s no fun!
I don’t like Mom or Dad or their silly\ncomputers! All I need are Pokémon!
I wish they would talk to me\ninstead of their computers...
A globe-trotting young\nadventurer. That’s me!
Seeing Pokémon from all over the\nworld is the purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me.\nFarewell! See you again!
Let’s take it easy with\nPokémon and with life.
It’s OK to bust your tail. But you\nneed some breathing room, too.
No problem. No problem.\nI’ll have another chance.
Eww, don’t tell me this is one of THOSE\nregions. You expect me to tip the plebs?
Hmph! Looks like no tip is necessary.\nThen I guess this region isn’t all bad.
Tsk! I’m not paying any tip, you hear?
Every time I travel, I find myself thinking\nthe same thing. Do you know what it is?
That in the end, east or west, home is best.
That if your life can really be changed by\ntraveling, you haven’t been living it right.
I’ll always work part-time, ’cause it\nlets me focus on what I really love.
You only ever get one life to live.\nAre you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever\nwithout being tied down.
I took this job because I wanted\nto see smiles on people’s faces.
Oh... Don’t look at me\nlike that. Smile! Smile!
Losing is frustrating, but\nI’m glad I saw you smile.
Let’s start the battle!\nTime’s a-wasting!
What? Is it already over?\nWe still have lots of time.
WHAT?! It’s already time?\nAnd we can’t go into overtime!
I’m battling here to promote\nthe café that I’m working at.
You’re not that strong, so we\ndon’t need you in our café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer!\nCome to my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokémon Fan Club!\nYour life will be happy!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club,\nyou’ll be strong, like me!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club,\nyour life will be saved!
I am not a regular Poké Fan.\nI am a major mega-Poké Fan!
I love Pokémon...\nI love, love, love Pokémon!
Remember this, you!\nI am a big Poké Fan!
I think I am a Poké Fan,\ntherefore I am a Poké Fan.
The Poké Fan is power.
You should remember\nthis: I am a Poké Fan.
There are young and beautiful people,\nbut youth is different from beauty.
If I’d only known that when I was young, I\nwouldn’t be having such a hard time now...
Youth is just youth. I wish\nI had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain\nstanding in my way, aren’t ya?
Yahoo! Yahooooo!!\nHear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared\ndown into some dark crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\nI’m a Hiker with a cult following!
Oh no! It’s over already?\nThe Hiker hunk is bored!!
This is important, so remember it:\ndon’t judge a book by its cover!
Even if it’s tough, even if it’s painful,\nI’mma do it! I’m a Trainer, dagnabbit!
I was born to do battle, ya hear?!\nI’m a darn tootin’ Trainer! I am!
Blast it all! And it’s all mah own fault! I’ve\ngotta apologize to mah sweet Pokémon!
Just because they’re both decided by who wins\nand who loses, don’t liken a battle to a game!
Fair play? What’re you talking about?\nIs that some kind of loser thing?
This...this can’t be... How could\nI be beaten at my own game...
My wovely widdle Pokémon are\ngonna take you apart, mmkay?
Don’t you worry your silly widdle head!\nI’ll take away ALL your pain, mmkay?
Oh phooey! Don’t you ever come back!\nIf you do, we’re gonna end you, mmkay?
Like a fragment of a forgotten dream, a\nmysterious Pokémon beckons to you...
Shhh. Rest now and close your eyes...\nYou won’t ever need open them again...
Being defeated by you makes this waking world\nseem even less believable than my dreams...
Everyone should just disappear!\nI don’t need anyone but Pokémon!
Humans should be gone from this world!\nI don’t like anything or anyone but Pokémon!
Wh-why do my Pokémon look like they\nare having so much fun battling you?
You have your way.\nAnd I have my way.
I will go my way because\nI don’t have any other way.
Your way must be rocky. Good luck\nto you. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don’t mess with me,\nor I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble\nfor me, but what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move?\nGaaahhh, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both\nVeterans, but I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad\nif they see that I’ve become a Punk Guy.
I can’t be like my mom and dad.\nSo I’ve gotta live as a Punk Guy.
Y’know, the truth is I really wanna be a normal girl\nand be all lovey-dovey with a normal boyfriend...
Sniffle... Maybe it’s ’cause I’m so stupidly\nstrong that no normal boys come near me...
I just want a boyfriend! No, not just any boyfriend—\nI want a silly boyfriend I can be lovey-dovey with!
Man, the bad things I used to get up to...\nI’ve done a little of this and whole lotta that.
This, that, and the other were like\nmy thing, you know what I’m saying?
But I guess that this and that are\ntwo totally different things, huh?
You wanna fight me? You do know I come from a\nlong line of punks, right? You’ve got guts, at least.
I’ll let you go this time. Get stronger,\nthen come back and fight me again.
Heh... I regret nothing... It was\na fight worth my family’s honor...
I’m warning you now—if you lose to me,\nyou’ll be smelling the rank scent of defeat!
Mm-hmm! So fragrant! Such a bouquet!\nLet me get another whiff of victory!
Hm, hm, hm! There was no avoiding it!\nYour Pokémon give off a real aroma of victory!
I, the great Dariole, fear\nnothing under the sky!
Mehehehehe... You fool!\nYou know not your place!
Feh! I will at least admit that you\nhave a skill for feigning strength.
“Une apple a day keeps ze doctor away.”\nAre you familiahr with zis saying?
You are what you eat, n’est-ce pas? And\nit seems you could use a pinch of ze winning.
If you want to win, ze whining, it will not\nhelp! Neizer will ze wurst, I’m afraid...
Y-you... How can this be... It is like seeing\nmy former master alive in the flesh again!
Thank goodness... In terms of strength, at least,\nyou have little resemblance to my former master.
Even your strength is just as my master’s was!\nP-please! Allow me to serve at your side!
The International Butlering Competition is drawing\nnear, so allow me to practice my skills on you!
Now, let’s see... If I accidentally beat my master...\nI know! I get on my knees and beg for forgiveness!
Now, let’s see... If my master easily defeats me...\nI know! That is the ideal moment for some flattery!
Always workin’ me to the bone, like I ain’t\neven worth their time of day or nuttin’!
What a waste! If only I could beat those\nrich jerks I work for this nice and easy!
What a bunch of louts! Don’t they even get that\nI’m always working my tail off over here!
Talk is unnecessary...\nI will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I’m broken...
I have very low self-esteem, so I like\nhaving someone else give me orders.
Well, you’re not my master, so I\nguess you can’t help being weak.
Ohhh... Could you please give me an order?
This isn’t a uniform—it’s just what\nI like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime.\nDoesn’t it look good on me?
I wish I could live in the worlds that\nI see in games, anime, and comics.
I’m not cut out for a regular\njob, so I make my living on art.
I envy Pokémon, ’cause they’re so\ncarefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah! If I could do a regular job, I’d\nquit this stinking art in a second.
Every time a Pokémon uses a\nmove, my heart trembles!
Nothing stirs the soul\nlike Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so\nbeautiful! I could almost faint!
I will make you cry, ’cause you\njust don’t know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and\nconfusion can also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate\nthe value of defeat and sorrow.
(This kid looks like a real sucker. All right!)\nOhhhh, poor me! No one understands my art...
I’d love to do a painting of you, you know.\n(Because I could sell it for a mint! Hah!)
Please come to the gallery to see my works!\n(You look dumb enough to buy something!)
The battle between us two...\nWithin and of itself, that is art.
Yes... I shall name this piece...\n“The Pitiful and Somehow Unsightly Youth.”
Yes... I shall name this piece...\n“The Tragic and Yet Alluringly Beautiful Artist”!
I collect the random scribbles of Pokémon, then\nsell ’em as “art.” I’m makin’ a fortune over here!
It’s like stealin’ candy from a baby!\nI’m livin’ the good life, all right!
The ones to blame are the ones who buy this junk.\nThey’re the ones who think it’s worth something.
The job site can be quite dangerous, but\nI have to keep working with my Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well,\nand it’s ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I won’t be able to make any\nmoney tomorrow with these injuries!
Welcome, welcome! Step right up!\nStep right up and battle a spell!
Only the winner! Yes, sir!\nOnly the winner can celebrate!
Enough... That’s enough...
I do menial work every single day.\nAm I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down\nthe smooth running of this machine!
I guess I’m happier than a person who\ncannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I’m the Worker\nthat everybody’s always talking about.
If you don’t know me, you’re bogus!\nGood-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the\nWorker everybody talks about!
There are no such things\nas brakes on MY skates!
I won’t stop! Well, I can’t stop!\nHey, that’s just the way I roll!
They’ve gotta be defective or something!\nPlease! Someone! Anyone! STOP ME!
I started skating because I’d heard that girls\nliked guys who skate. It’s not working at all.
Tell me the truth... Roller skating\nisn’t even cool anymore, is it?
And I’m terrible at Pokémon battles, too!\nNow I’m never gonna get a girlfriend...
No matter how speedy the Pokémon is,\nI’ll catch it on my super-speedy skates!
No Pokémon or Trainer can escape me on my\nspeedy skates!
Man, I’m so speedy and smooth! I should\nbe on “So You Think You Can Skate!”
Five seconds. You got that? I’m gonna\nwipe the floor with you in five seconds.
What? You say that was over five seconds?!\nTime moves differently in my world, OK?!
The moment that I hadn’t beat you in five\nseconds, I’d already lost...to myself.
C’mon, pal. I’m just a newbie over here.\nYou’re gonna take it easy on me, right?
N-no! This is, uh...just a\nfluke! I really am a noob!
Whatever. That’s, like, sooo amazing.\nYou really showed me, huh? Really.
Ngh! Nosebleed! When I get too excited,\nmy blood pressure goes through the roof!
I just can’t stop these blasted nosebleeds!\nEvery time I get excited or nervous... Argh!
Uhhh... It’s not...stopping...\nI’m starting to feel...kinda...dizzy...
You’re a rather delicate-looking little\nthing, hmm? Sure you’re up for a battle?
See? What did I tell you? \nAre you ill or something?
Whoa-ho! Sorry for jumping to conclusions!\nWho’d have ever guessed you were strong!
Hey! You! Yeah, you! Let’s work\nup a good sweat together, right?
Hey, don’t sweat it... Sometimes\nyou’ve just gotta learn to let it go.
You had me sweating bullets there!\nThat’s what being young is all about!
I didn’t choose to be born a woman, OK?\nI didn’t choose to grow up and be beautiful!
Hey, it’s not like I chose for the battle to\ngo this way, all right? Don’t go blaming me.
Appearing, battling, then disappearing again...\nIt’s not like I was born just to play this bit part!
Breathe deeply of my perfume before you\ngo. Get a whiff of a real Beauty’s aroma!
Oh my, did you get too close? What\nare you, some kind of perfume fanatic?
The truth is that my “perfume” is nothing more\nthan the scent of my cheap fabric softener.
The endless process of entropy...\nThat is where nature’s true beauty lies.
It is only right to be who and what you are. Do\nnot fight it. Just leave yourself in fate’s hands.
You don’t understand? Well, neither do I.\nIt’s really just something I heard somewhere.
Ooh la la! Little Trainer! Graceful blossom!\nI’m going to snippety-snip you right at the stem!
La, la, oomph! Now where shall I \nstart pruning, eh? Snippety-snip!
N-non! Not so fast! I mean you to\nbe the prize bloom in my garden!
Watch out! You’re on the menu next!
What a pushover you were!\nThat was a piece of cake, my little cream puff!
Oh... I think I’ll go back to the kitchen and\nhave a nice slice of some humble pie...
Ready for the big game?\nGot your cap on straight?
My oh my!\nMy Pokémon knocked it out of the park!
Hey, another out. So what?\nWe’ll come back! We always do!
Grip and rip, baby! I’m going to capture\nevery moment of this trip for posterity!
Here, here! Take my camera, and get a shot of\nme looking awesome after beating you in battle!
I don’t need any memory like this! Who\nwants to remember their failures? Delete!
Three-star restaurants? Shopping? Sightseeing?\nIt’s all so...so ANNOYING! I’m about to lose it!
Everything is about what SHE wants to do...\nExactly what part of this is “our” honeymoon, huh?
You’d better remember this for your future, kid.\nNothing ruins a honeymoon quite like a spouse!
Farewell, hearth and home and all\nI know! I shall become a Tourist!
Yes, a man must take at least one great journey!\nEven if my $1 flight ended up costing me $400...
I leave my beloved family behind in my hometown\nand set out upon my lonely journey of a lifetime!
An airplane that soars across the sky, leaving\ntrails of jet stream behind it... That is how I fly!
Indeed! This is my moment of takeoff!\nI’m taking off from you! Eat my dust!
To think that I was grounded due to you...\nOhhh! I’d better get a hotel voucher at least!
I can’t tell my new husband now, of course,\nbut the truth is that I used to be a Punk Girl!
Hiding any unpleasant details of my past...\nAin’t I just the picture of a perfect wife?
Ehhh, off with you! If you don’t, I’m gonna make\nyou listen to me gush about my husband all night!
I’m going to battle you with the Pokémon that\nmy darling gave me as a symbol of our love!
A win for the love between me and\nmy darling... It will burn forever!
Y-you defeated the symbol of our love...\nDoes that mean that we’re over already?
I have raised these very special\nPokémon using a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak\ndepending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn’t supposed to be like\nthis. Did I administer the wrong blend?
Shall I share an exclusive tip\nfor training great Pokémon?
You’ll be perfect if you buy my\nbook of Pokémon training tips.
You’ll be fine if you buy my\nDVD of Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family! See\nthe solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters!\nOur family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My...my family!\nWhat have you done?!
What you like doing and what you’re\ngood at doing aren’t always the same.
I’m good at battling, but\nI don’t enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job, you\nhave a sense of fulfillment, don’t you?
Let me be brief.\nYou cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win,\nbecause you are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good.\nYou are really pretty good.
Don’t underestimate me because I am\nold. I’ll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I’m old but still going strong!\nI can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat such a\nhelpless old man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon...but I have\nno one to carry on the family business...
If I’d had a child like you, my golden\nyears would have been carefree...
I wish my son were\nas mature as you are.
I feel sad whenever I see a\nbright, young child like you.
The first flush of youth...\nIt is too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin...\nI won’t get them back.
Don’t you think it’s a bit too much? This kimono?\nBut, well, I can only pull it off while I’m still young.
The kinds of fashion you can pull off have\na pesky expiration date. We call it “age.”
And, well, I suppose that when I’m older...\nThis kind of getup will be too much hassle!
The story has it that this precious kimono was\npassed down within my family for generations...
Excuse me! Would you keep your distance!\nWhat if you got my precious kimono dirty?!
Look, truth is that “passed down for generations” \nthing is a joke. Who’d be caught dead in this?
Hey! It’s me. It’s me!\nThe Owner of the world!
How’s that?\nOwned, suckah!
Pffft! I wasn’t seriously trying or nothing!\nNext time I’ll show you some real ownage!
Watch out! I’m always ripped and raring to go!\nShow me a Pokémon that’s beyond the beyond!
Take that! My Pokémon have never\neven heard of words like sedate!
Not yet! My Pokémon can still stand!\nIt’s not over! They can still stand!
My research will lead this\nworld to peace and joy.
I am a genius. I will control\nthe future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed\nto lose against someone like you...
Only my research is left in my life.\nI abandoned my family and friends.
It’s not bad to devote my\nwhole life to research, is it?
Dedicating yourself completely to\nsomething can cause loneliness.
Mwahahahaha... Please lend\nme a hand for my experiment.
Mwahahaha... Yes, I did it! The\nexperiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good...\nThe experiment was a failure...
You must face off against my\nsuper-powered-up Pokémon!
Well, it is only the natural outcome.\nThe power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have a strength\nbeyond the power of science.
If you lose, I’ll have you help\nme with my latest experiment!
Mwahahaha! You lost! Now\nstep right this way, Subject A...
Pah. I was sooo close to signing\nyou up as my new test subject!
Why do people compete and fight?\nThis is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt\nyour opponent’s feelings.
If you lose, you may\nresent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Fooooo!
Eeeeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense.\nPretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a\nsport are the height of vileness.
Defeat is worth nothing.\nLosers don’t need words...
Heh-heh-heh. If you lose,\nI’ll turn you into a Pokémon.
Heh-heh-heh. From today on,\nyou are already a Pokémon!
Next time I see you, I will turn you\ninto a Pokémon with my power.
I normally only ever listen to classical music,\nbut if I lose, I think I shall try a bit of new age!
New age simply refers to twentieth\ncentury classical composers, right?
Is this the dawning of\nthe age of Aquarius?
Heheh... I see it all clearly... You are a\ndoctor from an evil planet, aren’t you?
That was some kind of loss.\nWas there some sort of trap?!
Ugh... My powers... My powers\nare... I think I need a nurse...
You certainly look pleased with yourself.\nJust being near you makes me gloomy.
Now you’ve been dragged down, too.\nI think we could become friends now.
I hate the happiness of others...\nI’m just that sort of person, OK?
I praise your courage in challenging me!\nFor I am the one with the strongest kick!
Haha... I probably did not have\nto use my strongest kick on you.
Oh. The Pokémon did the fighting.\nMy strong kick didn’t help a bit.
’Sup! I’ll give it all I’ve\ngot! Let’s do our best!!
’Sup! That’s enough, friend!\nYou gotta value your life, yo!
’Sup! Good work. I tried everything I\ncould, but I’m still pretty disappointed, yo!
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don’t have to try to impress\nme. You can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It’s hard to say good-bye, but\nwe are running out of time...
Are you ready? I’m\ntaking my gloves off.
Well, well... You’re not even in\nmy league. This is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe\nI lost! Who are you?!
I sure would like to do the fighting\ninstead of my Pokémon, if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a\nchallenge. I want it to be personal!
Ah, I tingle with excitement.\nI sure would like to fight...
Halt at once! You there!\nLet us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield! \nPlease spare me!
When I am surrounded by nature,\nmost other things cease to matter.
I won the battle. But victory is nothing\ncompared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn’t matter to the vastness\nof nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I was born a\ncity boy. I yearned for country life.
Do you have a nice small hometown?\nIf so, you should go back and visit there.
I don’t have a small hometown to go back\nto, ’cause I was born and raised in the city.
It’s my mission to protect nature\nand all the Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural\norder, I will put them in jail!
Protect Mother Nature!\nOr I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect\nMother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich, healthy\nenvironment and for the sake of Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by\ngathering money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn.\nLet me give you a crash course!
You didn’t win alone. You couldn’t\nhave won without your Pokémon.
You seem quite confident.\nI’ll sink you straightaway.
I am devoting my body and\nsoul to Pokémon battles!
AAAH! I am sooo scared!\nI will never do it again... Sorry!
I’m working very hard, but that\ndoesn’t mean that I’m strong.
You’re a strong Trainer, so I\nthink I was just lucky this time.
What?! Even I can lose?!\nBut I’m a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but\nI became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have\nclear goals. That’s just the way it goes.
But I’m still not cool even though\nI’ve been recognized as an Ace...
The main character of this\nstory... I’ll tell you who it is!
The main character of the story\nis me! You are just an extra!
Of course, you are\nthe main character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon\nbattle against the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time on\nsuch a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho ho ho! That was to our liking!\nWe find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and\nfight forever. That’s the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won’t be\nsatisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn’t it?
Your fighting style suits you very\nwell. You could be an Ace Trainer.
I can see the despair in\nyour eyes. Bring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected.\nYou should consider starting over from zero.
Did I underestimate you? Or was\nit your true ability that let you win?
Hey, you, young Trainer.\nI’m utterly stylish, aren’t I?
I’m so stylish, I hypnotize myself!\nYou’d better keep your distance!
I’m a wreck. I’m adrift. It just kills\nme. It’s so hard to be too stylish.
I won’t lose against a kid like you who\ndoesn’t know anything about battles.
You really are an amateur. No sweat.\n(Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner?\nHahaha... I-I knew that, of course!
Ugh. Cough, cough! I don’t feel so\nwell. Please show a little kindness...
I lied when I said I didn’t feel well!\nVeterans will do anything to win!
You’re very sharp! You didn’t\nfall for my fake sickness, huh?
Come. I will give you a taste of a\nVeteran’s well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran’s Pokémon?\nDefeat tastes quite bitter, doesn’t it?
You have served me a spicy defeat.\nAnd yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute! Come, I\npromise to be nice this battle.
You are just too, too cute. You are!\nI want to see you again. I’ll be waiting!
Your battle is too cute, too!\nLet’s play again sometime.
Oh? Aren’t you a child? Who\nsaid you could come here?
You’re not bad, but you’re immature.\nCome back when you’ve learned a bit.
I thought you were a child.\nHee hee... You are tough...
Don’t you call me a Veteran! A\nwoman is always young at heart!
I’m not finished with love or Pokémon!\nI’ll stay fit and ready for both all my life!
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and\nmy back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker.\nI have lots of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my\nbackpack, aren’t I? Aren’t I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag!\nOh... Wait... My Bag has a hole...
I’m not traveling in\nsearch of freedom.
You’re carrying bulky luggage,\nbut do you really need it all?
My Bag is like the sky...\nIn other words, it is empty.
Oh bother! It’s just SUCH a hassle the way\nthat I am always winning with my Pokémon!
Oh! Bother and vexation! This is just too much!\nI can’t stand how good it feels to win all the time!
Hey, can’t you take a hint?\nI was trying to fake you out!
They say that the rich don’t have to fight\nfor anything, but I LOVE a good battle!
This buzz after battle is the best!\nIt’s like I just closed a big deal!
If you want to dream big, then you’ll need to\nbuild up a whole lot of experience in battle!
Hey! Hey! Please check\nout my cute Pokémon!
How about that? I’m\nproud of my Pokémon.
Oh no, don’t bother them like that!\nPlease leave my Pokémon alone...
Being a Garçon is my disguise,\nand it helps me live a quiet life.
On my days off, the real me can\nappear! Yes, I am an Ace Trainer!
I’m struggling to make a living, so\nI’ve been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest.\nI don’t think I will lose to you.
Did you think you could beat\nme with such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It’s hard. It sure\nis frustrating to lose.
Don’t you think a restaurant\nfor Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will order a\nfull-course meal for Pokémon.
It’s a restaurant for Pokémon,\nnot a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Harooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the great mountain range of\nyour life! Overcome me if you can!
Hahaha! I am the summit, and the\nroad to reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed\nthe mountain! This is my summit!
I’m gonna give you an experience so\nsweet that your eyes are gonna spin!
The dazzling romance of battle will\nmake you grow into a real adult...
Phew... You are smoking hot! It’s like\na sweltering summer night in here!
The pretty-suited Pokémon soldier who\nsprinkles love on the world appears!
Take that, evildoer! I am the pretty\nsoldier of “Prettiness and Pokémon”!
I can’t be defeated yet... I still have to\nprotect all that is pretty in the world...
Scary places are the best to me.\nI’d love to live in a cemetery...
Healing sites are nice, too, but they\ncan’t hold a candle to haunted sites!
In a cemetery where the party begins\nafter the day ends. Yes, that’s the life for me...
I may look like this now, but I was\nonce a Beauty, too, you know!
I’m super popular with ghosts, but we have\nvery ethereal relationships.
After I was dumped by my boyfriend, I fell into\ndepression. Before I knew it, I looked like this!
I can really cut loose in Pokémon\nbattles without getting scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That’s why\nPokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don’t\nya? You’re my new pal!
My ’net friends said I wouldn’t\nbe taken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared...\nMaybe I’m not cut out for this.
Eek! I should’ve stayed\nin my room with my PC!
Sorry, pal. Nothing personal, but I’m abouts\nto go all kinds of crazy on your Pokémon!
My bad, my bad! Little too much for ya, huh?\nBut there’s no pullin’ punches in a fight, amirite?
Arghhh! You little—! That HURTS.\nBut, well, that’s how it goes, yeah?
Yo. You ready to start this already?\nI ain’t long in the way of patience.
Sucks, don’t it? If you don’t like that feeling,\nyou better be ready to do anything to win!
That’s fine by me! I like a strong partner! But\nyou’d never take me in a bare-knuckle fight.
I’m about to serve you up a slice of battle so\nexquisite you’ll think I’m the cream of the crop!
So? It was delicious, right?!\nHave some more then! MORE!
Stop right there! We haven’t\nreached the final course yet!
Slobber... Oooh, a tasty-looking Trainer\nand Pokémon have wandered my way...
Yum-yummm, you all look\ndelicious... Bagon appetite!
Mehehehe... Got away this time, did you?\nI’ll definitely be Gulpin you down next time!
I used to get two minutes of sleep per\nday. Being a Butler was one hard job.
I don’t know if they thought\nI was a Butler or a robot...
Change! It’s time for a change! I couldn’t\ntake that kind of job a single day longer!
I’m tired of doing nothing but serving...\nSo I think it’s time for you to serve me!
Outstanding! From this day,\nyou may call me “Master”!
No...wait... Don’t run away...\nYou’re supposed to be my Butler...
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I’ll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange.\nI feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of\nblah. I’m all achy...
I really feel blah...\nI think I’ll go home.
A child like you cannot understand\nthe kind of beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a loyal servant to beauty.\nUgly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I’ve\nbeen looking for...is you?
I paint pictures and live with\nPokémon. I’m enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will become a\ngood memory when you grow older.
Experience hardships when you’re still\nyoung. Old bodies just can’t take them.
All right, then. I’ll watch you.\nLet your passions run wild!
What? You’re done already?\nNo, I’ll have none of that!
Heheheh... Are you sure? Don’t\nyou think you could keep going?
Heehee! If you wanna see some of\nmy art, it’s displayed all over the city!
Who needs a gallery, huh?!\nThe streets are my art show!
The days that I spend dedicated to\nmy art... That is the art of youth!
If you work diligently,\nyou will get results.
You, keep trying.\nMaster the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently,\nthings don’t always go as hoped.
I’ve arrived from a distant island.\nMay I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I’d be \ngrateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon,\nmy wife is fit to burst with anger!
Pokémon battles are so much\nfun. There’s no way I can quit!
I don’t want to go home, ’cause my wife\nis as scary as a Legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary\ndays...so I gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me from\nboring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special\nperson like you, I just melt.
The thrill and adrenaline has me racing!\nYou look like you’re almost standing still!
By putting yourself into a corner,\nyou draw out your full potential!
Everything feels clearer when you get this\nexcited! I can’t stop this dangerous game!
I won’t get mad if you beat\nme. It’s just a game, after all!
Don’t get mad over something like this. There\nare things in the world more worthy of anger.
It doesn’t matter at all who wins or loses\na game. The one who had fun is the real winner.
You have to cut down on resistance\nif you want to go as fast as you can!
I want to melt right into that blurry scenery\nthat you can only see when going so fast.
Perhaps I could have gone even\nfaster if you hadn’t resisted me?
I’m the infamous “Cannon Girl” that all the town\nis raging about! I’ll blast right into your heart!
I’m fast! I’m strong! I’m lovely!\nNothing less for the Cannon Girl! 
Blast!
Lemme tell you, I’m mighty strong. Don’t\ncome whining to me after I warned you.
Well, aren’t you quite pathetic? This is what\nhappens when you can select an opponent.
Hey, now, just a minute there!\nI haven’t lost this thing yet!
Do not mistake the means for the goal.\nThat is what my master once taught me.
The battle is just the means.\nVictory is always the goal.
For you to defeat me like this...\nWhat is the goal you strive for?
Oooh! I’ve spotted some handy prey!\nThe hunt is about to begin... Game on!
C’mon, prey! You’ve gotta struggle\na bit more, or it’s not any fun for me!
Ohhh, a strong enemy! Is there\na continue option somewhere?
My Pokémon are my pride and joy, so take\nyour time and enjoy this battle with them.
Your Pokémon seem to be lacking a\nwee bit in the power department, friend.
Ahhh... That’s a fine, good Pokémon you\nhave. How would you fancy a wee trade?
“Harsh” and “bitter” are flavors in any good\nChef’s repertoire! Would you like a taste?
Your battling was bland, I’m afraid. What did you\nexpect to happen when you’re so unseasoned?
Yes, the harshness of that defeat...\nThe bitterness on my tongue now... It’s perfect!
I’m going to tell you something valuable:\nnever expect much from a famous food!
You expect too much of something famous, and\nyou just end up disappointed by reality.
“It’s even better than I thought it would be!”\nIf you can think that, you’ll walk away happy.
All right then. Let’s all be good little children\nand start our Pokémon lesson, shall we?
Oh my...\nIt looks like you’ll be repeating this lesson.
Oh my!\nYou’ve passed with flying colors!
Hey... Can I ask you a question?\nWhen did you start loving your Pokémon?
I’ve always loved my Pokémon.\nI really thought that was true, but...
I guess it’s more important to ask how long\nyou’ll keep loving them, though, isn’t it?
Being called a Beauty doesn’t excite me\nat all. It just seems like cheap flattery.
Certain types of people use sweet talk\nno matter what you look like. It’s meaningless.
It’s just plain creepy when someone uses\ncompliments to win your attention. Ugh!
Come on, let’s get on with it already!\nNo need to worry about particulars!
Regrets from the past, worries about the future—\nforget all that! All that matters is here and now!
Even if I try to forget, I can’t remember...\nThat’s probably all I need to know, isn’t it?
D’ya, uh, know where my little lady is?\nSeems like she’s gone up and missing...
Someone like me winning something like a battle?\nCity slickers sure are weak these days, ain’t they?
My little lady’s never been to a city like this’n.\nMay’ve bitten off more’n we can chew. Uh-huh.
Don’t these kind of guided tours make you\nfeel like you’re really not used to traveling?
Who was I kidding—going on a trip?\nAt home, I just hide inside. By myself...
Why’d I bother screwing up my courage to come\non a trip anyway? I should’ve just stayed home...
Ahhh! Blast! Where’d that useless\nhusband of mine get off to now?!
Ditching his new bride like this... He...he\ncan’t possibly be getting cold feet now?!
You’re even wilder than my new\nhusband... Oh no, this is just...
Woo-hoo! My husband got food poisoning,\nso now I get to do whatever I want to do!
Ahhh... It’s so fun and freeing... I guess\nI really am best suited to the single life...
Though the truth is that I just made him\na TV dinner because I wanted some time alone!
I have made them too strong.\nThey are beyond my control...
It’s all over now...\nNobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down...\nYou’ve saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon\nyou have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do?\nI expected more from you...
Wow! You’re amazing! You’ve\ntrained some great Pokémon!
Take a look at these Pokémon—I raised\n’em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon.\nThey’re my friends and my treasures.
You’re a strong one, sure ’nough.\nBut I don’t plan to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder. I can\ntame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are\nvery loyal to me, aren’t they?
They are too attached to me.\nThey are not fit for battling.
Monsieur? What’s there to be so sure about?!\nI’m sure I’ll bring you down, that’s for sure!
Argh! I hate being so sure all of the\ntime! I don’t want to be a Monsieur!
Arghh! You! You’ll regret this!\nI will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once...\n“Eyes! Aim for the eyes!”
What my brother told me\nwas right... Thanks, Bro...
I lost against a kid, Bro...\nI should’ve listened to you...
I can’t drop my luxurious lifestyle just\nbecause I’m older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child to accept,\nbut money does make the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits I\nlearned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy\nbloomer. I’ll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, blossom, and bloom!\nThis woman flowers in triumph!
I want to fall while still in bloom,\nrather than dying on the branch.
In my country, we say that white can\nhide all manner of sins. Isn’t it great?
But wait—doesn’t that mean wearing white\nmakes it clear you’ve got something to hide?
Oh, forget it! I’m done with fancy clothes!\nI’m ditching this outfit and going to get a tan!
I had no plans for the weekend, so I ended up\nwandering here before I knew what I was about.
The fact that you are so strong... It means\nyou have too much free time, doesn’t it?
Before I knew it, I’d been here for ages.\nBut I’m not lonesome. Of...of course not.

Hi, how are you! It’s Nita’s turn!\nWelcome to the Battle Maison!\c\nI’ll be doing Multi Battles myself\nwith my eldest sis, Morgan, today!\c\nOh, but you two don’t look all that\nfierce strong anyway, do you now.\c\nI don’t doubt I could take you both on\nalone and do a handy job of it, too.\c\nWell, let’s get cracking!
Nita: Th...thank goodness...\nThank goodness I could win...\c\nIf I lost to the two of ye now...\c\nMy sister would’ve... She’d’ve...\nAye, I would’ve had to leg it...
Nita: No, no, no! How could I—\nThis is terrible altogether!\c\nHow could you do this to me,\nyou wee, rotten Trainers?!\c\nDo ye not even know what\nMorgan’ll do to me now?!
... ... ...\nNow, Nita?\c\nDid you honestly think I’d ever let\nyou get away with saying such things?\c\nOur guests don’t look strong, is it?\c\nYou could beat them both, is it?\c\nYou go throwing shapes like that,\nyou had better be ready to leg it!\c\nAnd aren’t I always warning you\nabout the way you speak to guests?\c\nIs your head cut, girl! Have you not\na shred of scruple in your body?\c\nIf you lose now, you’ll never hear the end of it!
Morgan: ... ... ...\nWell, Nita.\c\nLucky for you, your opponent was having a rough\nday, so you were able to walk away the winner.\c\nI’ll do you a favor this one time only. But you had\nbetter remember what I’m telling you. Understand?\c\nYou’re too old to be so bold. If you greet guests\nwith that kind o’ cheek, they might not ever return.\c\nNow, my dear guests...\c\nI hope you’ll hear my apology and allow me to beg\nforgiveness for my sister’s rude words to you.\c\nI hope you’ll see fit to return to our Battle Maison.
Morgan: ... ... ...\nNITA!\c\nOh, I’ll do you, you little waster!\c\nFirst, you mouth off to our guests, with\nyour boasting and insulting them so...\c\nAnd then you lose in battle despite it?!\c\nDo you even take this work seriously?!\c\nCould you ever face our dear ma and da,\nrest ’em, after such shocking behavior?!\c\nMy dear guest...\nI am deeply sorry for this experience.\c\nI beg you will somehow overlook it and\ncome visit our Battle Maison again.\c\nNow I must have a...discussion with\nmy wee sister. You’ll excuse us...
Welcome to the Battle Maison!\c\nMy name is Dana. I am the second eldest \nof the four Battle Chatelaine sisters!\c\nLet me introduce my partner for this Multi Battle. \nNita?
Dana: ... ... ...[WAIT 30]\nWe have retained our victory.[WAIT 30]\c\nHowever, I must apologize[WAIT 30]\nto the both of you, I’m afraid.[WAIT 30]\c\nMy sister Nita should not have attacked[WAIT 30]\nyou like that without any warning.[WAIT 30]\c\nSuch behavior reflects poorly on[WAIT 30]\nthe dignity of the Battle Maison.[WAIT 30]\c\nNita! Are you even listening?[WAIT 30]\nApologize to them this instant!
Dana: Nita![WAIT 30]\c\nWe only lost the battle because you went and[WAIT 30]\nstarted it without waiting for me to be ready![WAIT 30]\c\nThe key to any Multi Battle is being[WAIT 30]\nin perfect sync with your partner![WAIT 30]\c\nCan you not get that through[WAIT 30]\nyour thick skull, you moppet?!
Eh, you and your innocent act, Dana!\c\nForget the show! Let’s just get on with it. \nIs this to be a battle or not, eh?\c\nI’m always up for a challenge,\nand I’m ready to start right now!\c\nThere! You’re wide open! I’ll take you down!
Nita: Ah, yer sister! Why should I?[WAIT 30]\nThey’re the ones at fault for being wide open![WAIT 30]\c\nI swear, Dana, you’ll drive me crackers[WAIT 30]\nwith your rules and manners.[WAIT 30]\c\nPokémon battles should be fought as we like,[WAIT 30]\nand who’s to tell us otherwise?[WAIT 30]\c\nAs long as it’s good fun for everyone,[WAIT 30]\nwhere’s the harm?[WAIT 30]\c\nI’ll stake my life that you secretly agree with me.[WAIT 30]\nAnd I’d suppose these two feel the same.[WAIT 30]\c\nThat was a grand battle altogether,[WAIT 30]\nand I hope we can do it again sometime!
Nita: What’s the situation, then? I don’t see[WAIT 30]\nwhy I need to care about that sort of thing![WAIT 30]\c\nAll a battle has to be is cracking good fun![WAIT 30]\c\nBesides that, my real specialty is Single Battle[WAIT 30]\nand has been since year dot![WAIT 30]\c\nWho cares a fig about being in sync?[WAIT 30]\c\nAs for you two, I hope I’ll see each of you[WAIT 30]\nin a Single Battle sometime!
What kind of Pokémon will you be battling with?\nHurry up and show me already, would you?
Well, I lost the battle, but at least I got to see\nsome amazing Pokémon. That’s fine by me!
I sure hope you’ll bring a bit more impressive\nPokémon along for our next battle, OK?
Whoa! What kind of luck is this? How did I get\nstuck battling someone so strong off the bat?!
Argh! I’ve lost! I couldn’t do a thing against you!
I...won?\nHah hah! Take that! I’m pretty good myself, huh?
My Pokémon are my friends!\nTake this! It’s the power of our friendship!
My friends tried their best, but we were still no\ncompetition for you and your team!
Did you see that?!\nThat’s the power of our friendship all right!
I came here because I wanted to take part in a\nfiery Pokémon battle of passion!
That was exactly the kind of battle that I came\nhere for! Thanks for showing me a good time!
Hmm. I really wanted to experience something more\nclimactic than that. Guess that battle was a dud.
All right! Here I go! I’m going to battle you with\nthe same old strategy I always use!
You have some amazing strategies yourself!\nI’ve learned a lot from this battle!
It went just as it always does!\nHahaha! Looks like I win again!
I’d rather battle Pokémon than sleep! I’d even\nrather battle than eat! So come on already!
That’s it! That’s exactly the kind of battle I love!\nYup, that’s what battling you made me feel like.
Come on, pal! Do me a favor and bring some\nstronger Pokémon along next time, won’t you?
You look like you could do some decent battling\nyourself! Hah, this is beginning to look promising!
That was a fantastic attack there!\nLet’s battle one another again someday!
That was no poor show you gave!\nCome challenge me again someday, won’t you?
Hahaha! Come battle against me, my Pokémon,\nand my blindingly beautiful smile!
Hmph... Well, your Pokémon was rather charming\nas well, wasn’t it? Though not as much as me!
My charming Pokémon gave its all for that\nbattle against you! And all for me!
Let’s go all out, but fight fairly!
Thank you very much for battling me squarely!
It seems our side was just a little bit stronger.
Be shocked by the strength of my Pokémon!\nTremble before us!
I was shocked by the strength of your Pokémon!\nI trembled before them!
You have learned the strength of my Pokémon!\nIt’s sunk right in!
I brought all kinds of Pokémon. ♪ Let’s play a lot!
I lost—but thank you! It was so much fun!
I wanted to play more! It ended too soon!
My Pokémon are unbeatable! They won’t lose!
Why?!\nMy unbeatable Pokémon...
Amazing, aren’t they? My unbeatable Pokémon!
I’ll win the tournament with the Pokémon that I\nhave worked so hard to get!
What?\nWhy did this Pokémon lose?!
Yes! I knew it.\nThis Pokémon really is the strongest!
If you get scared, it’s OK to run.\nDon’t push yourself. Just surrender!
Whoa! Please wait!\nYou... You’ve got me.
Tee hee! I showed you the difference between\nyour abilities and mine!
Hmm... I wonder what kind of strategy you’re\ngoing to use.
I just couldn’t read your attack at all...
Your strategies clearly need work!
I’ll send you flying with my extraordinary attack!
Eek! You sent my Pokémon flying!
Hee hee! You won’t beat me unless you train your\nPokémon even harder!
My thought-out strategy is my biggest weapon!
What? You outsmarted me?!\nWhat a clever Trainer!
You fell for my tricks!\nThis is how I battle!
Watch this! These are my best partner Pokémon!
Ha ha ha...\nThere’s always someone better...
Is that all you’ve got? You’ll never be able to beat\nmy partners like that!
My heart always races out of control before a\nPokémon battle!
Thank you for making my heart pound so!
There’s nothing that lifts my heart like the nice\ntaste of victory!
I hope that my Pokémon battle with you will\nbecome a wonderful memory!
This bitter memory of defeat...\nI won’t ever forget it!
This battle against you will be a memory that\nI’ll treasure!
I’ll show you what it takes to be a world champion!
If you’ve managed to beat me, then that makes\nyou the strongest Trainer in the world!
Now do you understand what it means to be the\nstrongest in the world?
How about I show you the strength that won\nat Pokémon World Championships?
If you beat me, that means that you’re strong\nenough to win the Pokémon World Championships!
Now do you understand the strength you’d face\nif you went to the Pokémon World Championships?
Even a Pokémon World Champion like me\ngets nervous before battles, you know!
What a strong opponent...\nThis is what makes battling so much fun, though!
It looks like my careful battling strategies still won\nout in the end!
Even a Pokémon World Champion like me\ngets nervous before battles, you know!
What a strong opponent...\nThis is what makes battling so much fun, though!
It looks like my careful battling strategies still won\nout in the end!
Watch out! I’m going to show you what a runner-up\nfrom the Pokémon World Championships can do!
To beat me, the second strongest Trainer in\nthe world...!
Did you think that being number two in the world\nwould make me a pushover? Think again!
Watch out! I’m going to show you what a runner-up\nfrom the Pokémon World Championships can do!
To beat me, the second strongest Trainer in\nthe world...!
Did you think that being number two in the world\nwould make me a pushover? Think again!
I’ll take you on in battle, even though I did place\nsecond at the Pokémon World Championships!
So there are still even stronger Trainers out\nin the wide world!
Did you get to feel it? The power of a second-place\nwinner from the Pokémon World Championships?
I’ll take you on in battle, even though I did place\nsecond at the Pokémon World Championships!
So, there are still even stronger Trainers out\nin the wide world!
Did you get to feel it? The power of a second-place\nwinner from the Pokémon World Championships?
You want to battle with me, the third-place winner\nfrom the Pokémon World Championships?
You’ve got the kind of strength that will take you\nwherever you want in the world!
That’s right! I won’t be defeated that easily!
You want to battle with me, the third-place winner\nfrom the Pokémon World Championships?
You’ve got the kind of strength that will take you\nwherever you want in the world!
That’s right! I won’t be defeated that easily!
Haven’t you ever thought that you’d like to know\nhow strong a third-place winner from the\r\nPokémon World Championships is?
To lose in a battle where I was being serious!\nYou’re strong enough to face the world’s best!
It looks like I came out on top—not just in luck, but\nin real strength, too!
Haven’t you ever thought that you’d like to know\nhow strong a third-place winner from the\r\nPokémon World Championships is?
To lose in a battle where I was being serious!\nYou’re strong enough to face the world’s best!
It looks like I came out on top—not just in luck, but\nin real strength, too!
Watch out, you young fool!\nI’ll be your opponent today!
Ho-how could I lose...\nOoohhh! It’s just so frustrating! 
Gwa-ha-ha-ha! You’re about 10 years early\nif you think you can take me on!
OK, here we go! Let’s battle!
Wow, you’re really amazing!\nYou must really love your Pokémon, right?
Pretty pretty please! Give me that victory!
I don’t want to lose anymore!\nNever, ever again!
What is this?!\nAhhhhh! I’m sorry, my Pokémon!
I’m over the moon!!!
This is a team made for winning!\nThey say that honest effort will never betray you!
What... Is this for real?
I’m the one who’s beaten everyone in the nation!
I don’t really know what you want from me,\nbut I just have to battle a bit, right?
There’s, like, no way I could have won against\nsuch a strong opponent. That’s crazy.
Huh? I won? What did I do? What happened?\nI don’t get it. Can you explain?
I’m always serious and ready to go!\nI’m going to go all out again today!
WHAT?! Are you serious?!\nI stayed up all night thinking of that strategy!
See! Everything went just as I expected it to!\nMy calculations were flawless!
C’mon! C’mon! Faster! Let’s go!\nMy Pokémon are chomping at the bit!
What a world! You’re amazing!\nBe my friend, why don’t you?!
I get to fight everyone in the world! I love it!\nThis is what living’s for, pal!
The word that can unite people around the world...\nThat word is “Pokémon”!
Battles all come down to the luck of a moment!\nYou’re amazing for having that luck on your side!
You’ve got to smile whether you win or lose!\nThat’s what it means to be with “Pokémon”!
It doesn’t matter who your opponent is. All you\nneed is the appropriate method, and you will win.
Even with the ideal method, I could not win...\nYour team is nothing short of amazing.
In any pursuit in life, you must fix your eyes on\nyour desired outcome and proceed accordingly.
Aha! Even half-hearted moves are enough to\nbefuddle an opponent!
Aha! A truly strong opponent will not be led\nastray by such moves!
Aha! You seem to have confused yourself\nin your effort to befuddle your opponent.
These competitions are like a wild party, right?\nYou never know what will come at you!
Your battling style is not bad!\nYour Pokémon seemed to have fun, too!
I was just having a good time, but I accidentally\nwent and won. Sorry about that!
What I want is the glory of victory!\nI’m going wrest it away with all my might!
I’m frustrated with all my might!\nI’m not going to forget you!
It was what I wanted with all my might!\nThat’s why I could seize victory for myself!
I only use the coolest moves!\n’Cause I want to win while looking cool!
I guess that just plain winning is cooler than\neven the coolest moves...
Any moves will look cool when we’re the ones\nusing them! Hah!
Every meeting in life is precious, every encounter\nto be cherished. Let’s make our Pokémon happy!
I must use this defeat as fuel for my improvement\nand grow stronger. Let’s meet again!
Win or lose, each battle is a unique experience that\nonly comes once in life. I’m glad we got to battle.

All right! Let’s go!
Yahoo! Ya-hoooooo!\nI did it! I won again!
No! I lost!
Haw haw haw... I’ll show you\nhow hawesome my Pokémon are!
What do you think?! Hawesome, huh?\nMy Pokémon and I are the strongest!
Could it be... How...\nMy Pokémon and I are the strongest, though...
No need to waste time saying hello.\nBring it on whenever you’re ready!
What a match! I’m quite\nsatisfied with the result.
I won’t lose next time!\nLet’s battle again sometime!
I’ve raised my Pokémon with great care.\nYou’re not allowed to hurt them!
Yay! Yay! I won!\nMy Pokémon and I are amazing, huh?!
Your Pokémon are more amazing!\nTrade with me!
I’ll show you the ropes of\nhow to really use Pokémon!
I guess we can stop training for today.\nYou learned some new things, right?
You actually taught me a lesson!\nYou’re pretty amazing!
You’re only young once. And you only get one shot\nat a given battle. Soon, you’ll be nothing but a memory.
A bit more color has been added\nto a page of my youthful memories...
I don’t need memories like this.\nDeleting memory...
School is boring. I’ve got nothing to do.\nYawn. I’m only battling to kill the time.
Am I supposed to be all, like, “Yay!” when I win?\nIt’s too late to get excited now.
I’m actually getting tired of battling...\nThere’s gotta be something new to do...
I’m a beginner, but I’ll do my best!\nI’ll give it everything I can. Watch me!
Oh! I forgot to finish off our battle!\nI still need to study more...
Sorry if I bored you!\nI’ll try harder next time!
I’m gaining as much experience as I can\nbecause I want to be a Gym Leader someday.
That was quite an experience. The data\nI got from you will help me grow stronger.
Even difficult, trying experiences\nhave their purpose, I suppose.
Hey! This is no laughing matter!\nWe’re about to battle!
Regardless of who wins or loses,\nwe should thank each other after a battle.
Regardless of who wins or loses,\nwe should thank each other after a battle.
I’ll give you a battle worthy\nof a battle-school valedictorian!
Now do you understand the ability of\nsomeone who’s at the head of the class?
Wh-where do you study?\nI want to study there, too!
My dad is a Veteran Trainer, so I\nshould have what it takes, too.
I guess the talent you’re born\nwith really does decide battles...
This result is impossible...\nI am my father’s son, after all.
I’m good at the strategy and tactics of battles,\nbut I’m bad at throwing Poké Balls!
I was able to throw my Poké Ball this time!\nIt usually just rolls out of my hand...
If only there were a machine that\nwould throw Poké Balls for me...
I’m honestly not that good at Pokémon battles...\nWhen I think about my future, though,\r\nit seems like I have no choice but to battle!
I hate to say this, but if you can’t even beat me,\nthe rest of the way is going to be really tough.
See... I knew I couldn’t win.\nI’m not cut out for competition.
Experience begets power! Isn’t that\nwhat they say?! Anyway, won’t you battle me?
Even an amateur like me can win!\nExperience is the best teacher, so they say.
This battle was a valuable experience.\nI still need to gain more experience!
There’s a limit to how far I could get studying\nby myself, so I started taking battle lessons.
It seems that my studies have paid off.\nCould this be my actual ability level?
All I learn in my lessons is the conventional way of\nbattling, which doesn’t seem useful in actual battles.
This is Rough Skin, isn’t it?!\nRain Dish, Rain Dish?
It’s not Rough Skin!\nRain Dish, Rain Dish.
This is Rough Skin, isn’t it?!\nRain Dish, Rain Dish...
Huehuehue... If it’s cash you want, I’ve got some.\nHow about you go and lose this battle for me?
I may have said I had cash, but I haven’t\nsaid anything about giving you any!
I couldn’t fool you, could I?\nYou do quite well, don’t you?
I shall present to you elegant moves\nworthy of the title of Rich Boy!
It’s said that a Pokémon’s strength depends on its\ntraining. It’s not your fault. It can’t be helped.
To think that anybody could be stronger than me!\n...You’re not just anybody!
My father, a great man, always said,\n“The ends justify the means as long as you win!”
It’s just as my father said...\nHistory is written by the winners.
Wh-why?!\nCould my father’s words have been wrong?
Just because I’m Daddy’s little girl,\nit doesn’t necessarily mean I’m ladylike!
I do what I want! I live how I please!\nThat’s the way Daddy’s little girl rolls!
That strength...\nYou’re like a thriving roadside weed...
Chosen Trainers will choose\nchosen Pokémon.
So it seems victory has chosen me.
It seems I have been chosen to lose...
There’s a certain etiquette to battles\nwith glamorous, elegant ladies.
Fool! Oh no, there I go again...
Such an immodest way of battling!\nI just can’t be around it!
You look so serious and boring...\nCan you keep me entertained?
Hey, we just got going!\nThis is where it starts getting good!
Ah... You weren’t bad...\nWhich only makes me miserable...
I may be incompetent, having been born only recently,\nbut I’ll take the liberty of battling you as best I can.
You graciously allowed a win to someone so\ninexperienced that I still have my baby teeth. I thank you!
Thank you so very much for spending time with\na novice like me, still so young I wet the bed.
Oh! Yer a bad guy, aren’t ya?\nI’ll stand up to ya!
Wahaha! Justice wins!\nI’m gonna exile you!
You didn’t let up at all, even against a little kid!\nYer a bad guy, just like I said!
Hey, baby! You’re just what I’ve been looking for!\nI’m not gonna let you get away!
Hey, don’t think bad of me, baby!\nYou ran out of luck when you met me.
I guess I slipped up there...\nYou did pretty good, baby.
My Pokémon and I are the strongest.\nWe’ll take care of each and every one of you.
My Pokémon and I were the strongest.\nWe took care of each and every one of you.
My Pokémon and I are the strongest, so\nthere’s no way we could have truly lost.
Um, this is what you call a battle, right?\nWhy do we do stuff like this again?
Um, that was what you call a battle, right?\nYou lost, so now you have to be my servant!
Umm, that was what you call a battle, right?\nI lost, so now do I have to be your servant?
I’m the heroine of justice!\nYou mysterious, evil person! I’ll drive you away!
Huh? I went to the trouble of taking you down,\nbut you didn’t explode like on TV!
Whoa! The world is falling into the hands of evil!\nAre we headed for an unhappy ending?
Snicker snicker...
Snicker snicker!
Sniffle sniffle...
I know you, Trainer!\nSo you’re the Champion, eh?
I beat the Champion,\nso I’m the new Champion!
Whoa! That’s what I expected\nfrom the Champion! Strong!
I’ve spent 20 years trying to find myself...\nBut where am I?
Before I start searching for my real self...\nWhere in the world are we here?
Wait up a second! Hey!\nDon’t you know who I am?
How many thousands of years has it been...\nIf only I could lose, my journey would end...
I won again...\nMy journey still isn’t over...
You... Thank you...\nNow my journey can come to an end...
Hey, don’t be so stuck up!\nBattles can be left up to fate!
Winning, losing—in the end, it’s all luck.\nBut if it’s fun, isn’t that enough?
Oh! Aren’t you the lucky one!\nI hope you also had fun, though.
Travels! Encounters! Love and adventure!\nWell, where will I find a darling to share it?
I’m not looking for a kid!\nTell me where the hunky men are!
Sniff, sniff... This is no good...\nI can’t smell the perfume of love. Bye!
I knew this cheap package tour\nwouldn’t be any good.
This tour’s supposed to come with\nPokémon battles, but it’s just making me tired!
Why would this place be included in the tour?
You know, the prices in this region\nreally are low, aren’t they?
Though the level of Trainers in this region...\nWell, they’re not worth writing home about.
I could live the high life in a country\nwhere everything costs so little!
My job is riding on the result of this battle.
I did it again. I won... I’m going to be fired for\nnot providing good-enough service...
That was close... I just barely lost...\nThanks to the service I provided, I can keep my job.
I’ve got no time for greetings!\nFood! Give me food, I say!
Hey... You lost, right?\nGive me food... Give it to me...
I...wanted to eat...until I’m stuffed...\none...last...time...
Welcome! Welcome!\nPokémon Trainers, right this way!
We truly thank you for your patronage.\nPlease do come again.
We have reached closing time for today.\nWe look forward to seeing you again soon.
Ain’t you dat Champion?\nLessee what you got!
Hohoho. Dat’s it, huh?\nEven the Champion ain’t nothin’ special.
I guess you could say I expected this, or—\nhow shall I put it—you gave me a wicked match.
I have confidence in\nmy Pokémon’s manners.
We’re competing to see who wins and\nwho loses, so of course we have manners.
I was so focused on manners that\nI overlooked a chance to win.
Welcome!
Thank you!
Please come again!
I’m begging for more allowance and saving my money\nso I can go on a trip around the world someday!
I turn 44 this year, but I have no intention of going\nout into the world until I’ve gone around the world.
When I said that the world was calling me,\nmy mom told me to get a job.
I can’t let Pokémon I really love battle.
My Pokémon could get hurt,\nso I can’t take them out here.
The Pokémon you use...\nDo you really like them?
The Pokémon Fan Club is a secret organization\ninto which only a chosen few may enter.
You don’t meet the prerequisites for admission.\nFirst, I recommend that you get stronger.
You’re actually good, aren’t you?\nJoin the Pokémon Fan Club!
My husband may not be much to look at,\nbut his love of Pokémon is what drew me to him.
The most important thing in a marriage\nis having shared interests, after all.
Looks fade with age anyway.\nIt’s best to have the same values.
Sometimes I drive myself crazy wondering\nwhy I wasn’t born a Pokémon.
I wonder if I could become a\nPokémon if I had a Trainer...
Oh, I wish I could crawl inside a Poké Ball to live!\nOoh, I want to be ordered what moves to do!
I’m drowning in Pokémon.\nIt might be too late for me.
I think life’s OK as long as you\nget back more than you lose.
Even my own family disowned me.\nAs long as I have Pokémon, that’s OK, though.
I inherited this big-boned body from my parents...\nI’m like a living mountain range...
Ha ha!\nNow I can consume some more calories...
It’s not enough... It’s never enough.\nMy bad cholesterol isn’t high enough...
I was born, raised, and live in the mountains.\nI’m an Ace Hiker, I tells ya.
You’re no good at all, I tell ya!\nWanna hide away in the mountains with me?
They say perseverance can move mountains.\nI won’t give up yet, I tells ya!
Muwahaha! The legend of my\ninvincibility begins with you!
I’m completely invincible!\nMy legend begins here!
Ha... Are you telling me\nthat your legend just started?
Wait! Wait!\nI’m still trying to think up my strategy!
I had no plan, but I won anyway!\nMaybe I shouldn’t overthink things!
I told you to wait a second!\nIt’s just that my strategy wasn’t ready yet!
I can hear a fairy’s voice...\nIt’s telling me not to slip up with you...
Thank you, fairy...\nI was about to be in trouble...
Fairy... I’m scared...\nHelp... Help me...
Uhnn... What is this place?\nIt doesn’t have the aroma of a fairy tale at all!
No, no, that won’t do, it won’t do at all.\nWhen I’m in trouble, I feel farther away from fairy tales.
I need to get out of this place.\nMy fairy tale is going to disappear!
...Stay away.
...Go away.
...Bye.
As you can see, I’m a bad guy,\nand that’s why I fight dirty!
You’re too soft to face off against a bad guy!\nYou’re making things harder on yourself.
OK, OK. All right, all right.\nJustice has to win in the end.
Huhuehuehue...\nNo crying when you lose...
Hey, hey! No crying!\nI’ve got no time for some kid’s tears!
Sniffle... Sniffle sniffle...\nI’m disappointed... So disappointed...
I have a strict policy about my hairstyle.\nIt’s my whole life, so I get really fired up about it.
When my hairstyle is looking really\nsharp, it gets me really fired up!
I’m having a bad hair day,\nso there’s nothing I could’ve done.
I hope the distance between us gets\na little closer during this battle.
Your fickle tenderness is piercing my heart.
Our feelings for each other are so strong that the\nloneliness will be terrible after we say good-bye.
Fair and square? Don’t make me laugh!\nThere’s no point to battles if you don’t win!
Victory is what makes battling worth it.\nWhat what?! I just dropped knowledge!
What can you learn from a defeat?\nAll you feel is regret, right?
Br-bring it on!\nBearing in mind that I’m a b-beginner!
Yay! Thanks for going easy on me!\n
Hey! Are you for real?\nI’ll pay you back for treating me like this!
Defeat is not a dish on my bill of fare!
Oh dear! You aren’t quite fresh enough, are you?\nNot even fit for a mess hall!
Oh, there’s a kick to you!\nYou must tell me your secret ingredient!
St-stay away from me!\nGet too close, and I will julienne you!
It...it...it’s all your fault for challenging me!\nNext time I’ll turn you into a tasty stew!
Stop! Just hold on a moment!\nI don’t want to be grilled over a flame!
Ahh... I’m starving...\nI’m too weak to even throw a Poké Ball...
I’m glad I won, but I can’t move another inch...\nSomebody... Get me some food...
I just...wanted to...\nstuff myself...one...last...time.
People say I’m a diamond in the rough.\nSure you wanna battle with me?
I don’t know what they mean, but\npeople say I’m a diamond in the rough!
There’s something about the phrase\n“diamond in the rough” that makes me hungry.
First comes practice. Second comes slacking off.\nThird and fourth come panic and more panic.\c\nFifth comes battle...
Apparently, hard work will never let you down.\nCouldn’t it be enough to work kind of hard?
OK, OK... I lose.\nMaybe I’ll just keep working kind of hard.
Th-this is my first real battle...\nM-my legs feel weak...
I can’t remember what orders I gave...\nB-but I won!
My mind is a blank.\nI can’t hold a thought in my head right now.
Just because I’m a Rising Star, don’t\nexpect the freshness of a newcomer.
That was beginner’s luck, if I do say so myself.
I may be a newcomer and\na Rising Star, but I’m already 39.
I slipped past my master to\ncome play here in secret.
I deceived my master by saying I was\nrunning errands and came here to play.
My master hates both Pokémon and battles,\nso there’s no other way for me to come here.
Very well then, I shall take the liberty of\ndetermining whether or not you possess\r\nthe qualifications befitting a master.
It seems that your power\nis slightly insufficient to employ me.
How wonderful! Won’t you hire me?\nI do command quite a salary, though.
I’ve been searching for a master I can\nserve for 10 years. I’m a wandering Butler...
O master, where art thou...\nPerhaps I should lower my standards...
Being a meddlesome old man won’t keep\nme fed. Isn’t there a master out there for me?
I started this job because it pays well,\nbut I’ve just about reached my limit!
Pokémon are good at doing what they’re told.\nMe? I absolutely can’t stand being ordered around.
Being bossed around is crazy annoying, right?\nThat’s one area where Pokémon are really great.
When you’re dressed like this and say cute\nthings, you’re pretty popular with lonely guys.
Lonely guys are easy to be around.\nYou never have to be yourself with them.
The problem is when I’m dressed like this, the man of\nmy dreams gets weirded out and pulls away from me.
Are you supposed to be my new overlord?\nWhat! Is this really OK?!
What? Are you through already?\nAs an overlord, you’re totally not worth serving.
I expected nothing less from my overlord!\nIt would be worthwhile to serve you!
My Pokémon will trump yours!\nYou can bet on losing!
All right! Victory is mine!\nFortune is smiling on me!
Ahh... I’m flat broke...\nThat’s it. I’ve got nothing left...
My paintbrush is made of secret materials.
Well, pull out a strand of your hair.\nI need it to make my paintbrush thicker again.
Hmmph...\nI won’t tell you the secret of my paintbrush.
You’ve got potential!\nAll right! I’ll make you my apprentice!
I feel great! The best!\nJust like that! Listen to me worshipfully!
I don’t care for your disobedient attitude!\nConsider yourself expelled from your apprenticeship!
A battle with me is a test\nof your aesthetic sensibility.
Hunnh... Not bad...\nYou’ve got a surreal side...
Hunnh... Not bad...\nYou’ve got a realistic side...
People have started calling me an up-and-coming artist,\nbut it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.
I thought I could make money if I just\nbought some paper and some paint...
There’s these people called curators who take most\nof my money, so it’s like I’m not making any money.
Release it now! Release the\npassion locked inside you!
Is that all you’ve got? Is that the sum total of\nthe passion you have locked inside you?
Ahh... That’s the kind of passion\nI’ve been looking for!
It bothers me that people always misunderstand\nme. I’m a lot more pure than everyone thinks.
My body and mind aren’t\nnecessarily always in sync.
I really don’t want my skin to burn,\nso I want to stay in the shade while I work.
You’d best not send out any weak Pokémon!\nYour opponent is my partner in construction!
Gwahahaha! How about that?! Didja see that?!\nMy partner’s rough and tough!
Ahh... My partner broke down.\nWhat am I gonna do at the site tomorrow?
I can’t spend all of my time battling\nwith Pokémon, or I could lose my job!
Even now, as long as I keep coming\nhere, I’m missing out on other things.
It’s not like I regret it or anything. A life where\nyou can go crazy about something is a happy life.
There aren’t as many people battling at work these days\nbecause they’ve moved on to the Contest Spectacular.
The Contest Spectacular is just superficial.\nIt’s just not in my nature at all.
I’m tired of losing battles.\nMaybe I’ll try going to the Contest Spectacular...
What I really want to do is surf. But I\ncan’t swim, so I got these Roller Skates.
No matter how good I get on these Roller Skates,\nI still don’t feel like I’m any more popular with the ladies.
I bet guys who can surf get more girls than\nguys on Roller Skates. I wish I could surf...
People call me the “electrastic” Trainer!\nThink you can keep up with me?
That speed! It’s electrastic!
Apparently electrastic isn’t a real word.\nI’ll keep using it because it’s cool, though.
I’m only good on Roller Skates.\nI can’t skateboard or snowboard at all.
I would never just skate by in battle!\nEven if I am wearing Roller Skates!
I guess I can’t just skate by anymore...\nEven if I am wearing Roller Skates.
Lots of the metal fixtures on my skates broke, and I’ve\nbeen stuck wearing them for close to four years now.
My Roller Skates have become\nlike a part of my body now.
Won’t they stink since they’ve been on my feet\nthis whole time? I even wear them in the bath!
Hey! If you’re not considerate to your elders,\nyou’ll be pulled out by the roots!
I’ll bet that turned your hair white!
The fruits of my victory...\nhave already been harvested...
Hey there! I’m a Gardener!\nMy scissors are my only real friends.
My specialty and my hobby are both cutting things!\nMy favorite move with scissors is Guillotine!
I knew I hated humans!\nAll I need is scissors!
If all you have is passable ingredients,\nyou can’t do better than passable battles.
You haven’t drawn out the\nnatural flavors of your Pokémon.
I have no idea what the\nnatural flavors of my Pokémon are.
Adults don’t say what they’re really thinking, OK?\nYou have to read between the lines to find the truth.
Uh-oh! You’re OK, aren’t you?\nSorry I flew into a rage!
Well done! You were lovely!\nI can’t imitate that!
There are no Trainers who know\nmy techniques but can’t cook!
Hahaha! Thanks for the nourishment!\nThat was a pretty tasty encounter!
What sort of Trainer is this...\nThat flavor is too peculiar to eat...
Even as old as I am, I just\ncan’t give up Pokémon battles.
What would my life have\nbeen like without Pokémon?
You have to be careful! Pokémon battles\ncan steal away so much of your time...
Isn’t that nice... You’re still a kid...\nI wish I could go back...
I’ve become a cynical adult,\nso I even cheat during battles.
I was so innocent back then...\nWhere has that girl gone?
I’ve always wanted to be a Beauty, so I’ve made\na fresh start, focusing on my appearance.
Whatever your dream is, if you want to make\nit a reality, you have to do what it takes.
Six months’ investment in the latest treatments...\nLook at me now! I glow like never before!
My trip starts here!\nI’ll beat you and get a ticket!
All right! I’m on my way now!\nMy battle begins here!
The train called victory has left without me...\nMy trip ends here...
What’s that? I look bored?\nThat’s because this is a company trip.
I really can’t take sleeping all huddled\ntogether with my coworkers in a big room.
Don’t you think it’s better to take trips alone\nor with someone you love or something!
Traveling alone...\nIsn’t it great to be so free...
I’m traveling alone, so it’s fun\nnot needing to worry about anyone else...
Traveling alone is the best...\nAfter all, I’m all alone...
Traveling is fun, but thinking about\nwhat souvenirs to buy is a hassle.
I mean, it costs money, so I wish the\ncustom of giving souvenirs would go away.
It’s not like anybody is ever really happy\nto get souvenirs from people anyway.
A true Gentleman’s heart\nnever wavers in battle.
Ha... Snicker snicker...\nI can’t...stop laughing...
Ooh... Ooh...\nI can’t...stop crying...
I’d like to have a pleasant battle!\nProvide me with that service!
Taking it easy on me isn’t very good service!\nYou have no idea how to entertain!
Yes yes! That was a nice battle!\nIt feels good to lose like that!
Don’t be nervous—leave it to me.\nIf it’s technique we’re talking about, I’m confident.
How was it? It was fun, right?\nI knew my technique would win out!
For my Pokémon to not even stand a\nchance, you must be quite the technician!
For the sake of your future, think about\nhow you interact with your elders.
You know how to make your way in the world.\nI think you’ll succeed in the future.
You don’t know anything about the world.\nI think you’ll struggle in the future.
Even though my upbringing and behavior\nare poor, I’ve raised my Pokémon well.
Right? Pretty good Pokémon, huh?\nI’m suited to raising things.
Unlike my diabolical self,\nthese are some good Pokémon.
You get as much love as you give\nwhen you’re dealing with Pokémon...
Pokémon...are nice...\nThey may be selfish, but they won’t betray you.
The only thing I still believe in...\nis my Pokémon...
Unlike humans, Pokémon never betray you.\nThat’s why I decided to love them.
This proves my Pokémon\nhave accepted my love.
I am happy! Happy, I tell you!\nDon’t look at me like that!
There’s a lot that goes into\nbeing a Pokémon Breeder.
The most fun part of this job\nis getting close to Pokémon.
The hardest part of this job\nis saying farewell to Pokémon.

Welcome to the Battle Maison!\nI’m Dana. Thank you for coming.\c\nI am the second eldest of the four sisters\nwho run this Battle Maison.\c\nI am also a Triple Battle expert!\c\n...I’ve no use for an act like\nthat here in Hoenn, have I?\c\nEveryone here knows my true self!\nWell, give us a battle, then!\r\nI’ll show you how it’s done!

You’re all right...\nAway ye go and keep on winning!\c\n’Cause if ye do...\nI’ll show ye my real skills.\c\nYe’d do well to mind yourself then!
If you’re free for a time, come on by. ♪\nIf you’re bored for a while, stop on in. ♪\r\nBattle till you burst, oh, won’t you try. ♪\r\nWant to battle? The Battle Maison Replica’s fine. ♪\c\nHeh heh! What do you think, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0C06)]my ladyoung missie?\nWe just had that jingle written for our\r\nwee Battle Maison Replica.\c\nMusic can be a lovely distraction.\nD’you not find that yourself?\c\nOh me, I’ve not even introduced myself,\nhave I? Well, don’t bite my head off!\c\nI’m the eldest of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters.\nDo call me Morgan.\c\nWe all thank you for coming to visit our\ncherished Battle Maison Replica today.\c\nI’ll do me best to entertain here\nat the birthplace of the Battle Maison.
Thank you for the battle, love!\nDid you have a bit of fun yourself?\c\nHere in Hoenn is where our Battle Maison\nwas born—and me sisters and I, as well.\c\nThese days we make more over in Kalos,\nso this is no more than a replica now.\c\nI’ll be taking me leave, but I look forward\nto your next visit.
Thank you for the battle, love!\nDid you have a bit of fun yourself?\c\nGet out of the garden!\c\nI’d no idea you were such a fine Trainer! I should expect\nno less from Hoenn’s Champion, I suppose.\c\nI’ve taken quite a shine to you, my fine [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]ladgirl!\c\nSad to say, we’ve quite run out of time for\nour battle today.\c\nI wait with all my heart for the next time\nyou come to challenge me!
Thanks for coming to the Battle Maison![WAIT 30]\nI’m Dana.[WAIT 30]\c\nI am the second eldest of the four sisters who run[WAIT 30]\nthis Battle Maison.[WAIT 30]\c\nI will praise your bravery, at least, in attempting[WAIT 30]\na Multi Battle with me![WAIT 30]\c\nAnd, of course, I am hardly alone![WAIT 30]\c\n...[WAIT 30]\c\nOh, give me a break, Evelyn![WAIT 30]\nIt’s your line next! Come on!
Dana: Well, I suppose that wasn’t so bad then...[WAIT 30]\c\nYou can’t stack up to the skills of us sisters, though![WAIT 30]\c\nIsn’t that so, Evelyn?[WAIT 30]\n...[WAIT 30]\c\n...[WAIT 30]\c\nOh, for pity’s sake, Evelyn! Wake up![WAIT 30]\nI’m morto for them and you! Honest!
Dana: Ugh...[WAIT 30]\nYou’re not bad, that’s for certain...[WAIT 30]\c\nTo think that you would be able to break through[WAIT 30]\nour perfect combo...[WAIT 30]\c\nBut my real stage is the Triple Battle![WAIT 30]\c\nAnd Evelyn’s speciality is Double Battle![WAIT 30]\c\nIf you took either of us on in our own specialties,[WAIT 30]\nwe’d never lose to you![WAIT 30]\c\nIsn’t that right, Evelyn?!
I-I-I’m sorry, Dana...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um, my name is Evelyn...[WAIT 30]\nI-I-I’m usually in charge of Double Battles...[WAIT 30]\c\n...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um...so...well...[WAIT 30]\c\nI’m not all flash like my sister Dana when it comes[WAIT 30]\nto talking...[WAIT 30]\c\n...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-umm! Please! I’m sorry, but...[WAIT 30]\nPlease start the battle already!
Evelyn: Huh? Wh-what?[WAIT 30]\nD-did you say something, Dana?[WAIT 30]\c\nI was so n-nervous...that I don’t remember[WAIT 30]\na thing o’ the battle.[WAIT 30]\c\nSniff...sniffle...[WAIT 30]\nOh, I am scarlet for myself...[WAIT 30]\c\nUmmmm...I... I... I...[WAIT 30]\nTh-thank you for the battle![WAIT 30]\c\nP-please visit the Battle Maison again![WAIT 30]\nN-now...excuse me!
Evelyn: Wh-wha... Well, I never said...[WAIT 30]\c\nI-I don’t really think I’m all that good at[WAIT 30]\nDouble Battles either...[WAIT 30]\c\nThe r-reason we just lost was because[WAIT 30]\nI’m so slow...[WAIT 30]\c\nS-so I don’t think these guests should[WAIT 30]\nexpect much from me...[WAIT 30]\c\nI’d look right silly... Please...[WAIT 30]\nPick anything but Double Battle...[WAIT 30]\c\nN-now then... I’ll excuse myself...[WAIT 30]\nThank you for the battle...
W-w-welcome...[WAIT 30]\nTo the B-Battle Maison...[WAIT 30]\c\nUh um...[WAIT 30]\c\nWe would like to thank you...for choosing[WAIT 30]\na Multi Battle today...[WAIT 30]\c\nS-so...um...[WAIT 30]\c\nYou will be facing my elder sister Morgan[WAIT 30]\nand me, Evelyn, today...[WAIT 30]
Evelyn: Th-th-thank you very much![WAIT 30]\c\nY-your Pokémon were brilliant![WAIT 30]\c\nI w-will also work hard, so you’ll never be stuck![WAIT 30]\nfor a challenge...[WAIT 30]\c\nSo please...[WAIT 30]\nCome visit us at the Battle Maison again...
Evelyn: Um, fair play, you two![WAIT 30]\nYou were both so very strong![WAIT 30]\c\nTh-the truth is I was nervous facing two strangers[WAIT 30]\nat the same time.[WAIT 30]\c\nSo I don’t know what I did...[WAIT 30]\c\nB-but I will try even harder the next time that we[WAIT 30]\nhave a Multi Battle...[WAIT 30]\c\nSo please d-do definitely ask me to join you[WAIT 30]\nin a Multi Battle again.
Evelyn? Are you ready to begin?[WAIT 30]\nAre you nervous again, pet?[WAIT 30]\c\nRemember, it is very important to greet our[WAIT 30]\nprecious guests...[WAIT 30]\c\nI know some of these goofs like it when you[WAIT 30]\nwaffle about, so that’s fine for business, but...[WAIT 30]\c\nHmm?[WAIT 30]\nOh? Oh! Were you earwigging?[WAIT 30]\c\nWhat a cheeky thing you are![WAIT 30]\c\nI should not have been discussing[WAIT 30]\npersonal matters in front of a guest![WAIT 30]\c\nL-let’s just get straight to the battle, shall we?[WAIT 30]\nAnd not before time![WAIT 30]\c\nEvelyn and myself will do our very best,[WAIT 30]\nthough we’re both quite hopeless at all this!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you two![WAIT 30]\nDid you enjoy our wee little combo?[WAIT 30]\c\nI’ve two other younger sisters, sure, in addition to[WAIT 30]\nmy shy Evelyn here.[WAIT 30]\c\nIf you happen to meet either of them, I trust they’ll[WAIT 30]\nshow you a good time.[WAIT 30]\c\nWe’ll all be looking forward to your next visit, then![WAIT 30]\nDon’t work too hard!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you![WAIT 30]\nDid you enjoy our little combo?[WAIT 30]\c\nOur Evelyn is quite reserved, so she gets a wee bit[WAIT 30]\nnervous in these big battles.[WAIT 30]\c\nBut she’d take you on handily in a Double Battle![WAIT 30]\nI hope you’ll claim a Double Battle with her soon.[WAIT 30]\c\nAnd of course I’d be tickled meself to see you in[WAIT 30]\none of my Rotation Battles.[WAIT 30]\c\nWe’ll all be looking forward to your next visit, then![WAIT 30]\nDon’t work too hard!
The battles continue forever!\nWelcome to the world with no end!
If you’re already losing, maybe\nit’d be better to turn back now.
Ahaha! There it is! That’s right!\nYou’re already right at home in this world!
Victory will never come to those\nwho aren’t prepared to face defeat.
I’m not prepared to lose,\nbut I won easily anyway.
Keep winning for me, too.\nBecome the number-one Trainer here.
Miniskirts are, like, unbelievable, right?
They’re easy to move in and cute.\nAnything but a miniskirt would be unbelievable, right?
You’ve got to enjoy a fad\nwhile you still can, right?
Close my eyes... Sharpen my senses...\nI have to trust my instincts...
I’m glad I trusted my instincts...
My judgment wasn’t off, though...
In order to become a first-class Trainer,\nI was forced to come study abroad here.
I can learn a lot from Pokémon\nbattles in this country.
I’m too homesick to want\nto do any studying...
My dream is to be rich\nand live in the lap of luxury.
The reason I’m here battling\nlike this is to try to grab my shot.
When I’m a big, important man,\nI’ll make you regret this.
My Pokémon and I will take the liberty\nof using you to face off against.
I suppose it could be said that my relationship\nwith my Pokémon is satisfactory for the time being.
I need to rethink my relationship with my Pokémon.
If you slacked off on your studies, you’ve got\nno chance. Capable girls like me are capable.
If you waste all of your time,\nyou’ll never grow as a Trainer.
When you lose, do you go so far as to analyze the\nreason for your defeat and review your performance?
I’ve already got most of the Pokémon\nand more money than I know what to do with.
I just win all my Pokémon battles, too.\nI feel like my life is already over.
I’m so well off that life has become tedious.\nEven experiences like this are fun for me.
Hey, hey! I’m a Rich Boy!\nBow to your patron!
Now you understand, eh? Don’t be so\nimpudent as to think you could defeat me!
Hey! How dare you do such\na thing to a Rich Boy like me!
My family thinks battles are beneath me,\nbut I can’t help but enjoy them.
Gwahaha... I can’t get enough of the feeling of\nsuperiority when looking down on a loser...
Uhhn... I can’t get enough of the feeling of loss when\nthe winner looks disdainfully at me...
I was born rich and I party all the time.\nI’m what you call party people.
Battles are way more exciting than any party.
Ahh... I want to have an all-night\nPokémon-battle party!
My dad catches Pokémon for me.\nI don’t know how strong they are, though.
My Pokémon and I ARE strong!\nThank you, Dad!
My Pokémon and I are weak...\nStupid Dad!
My big brother who never comes out of his room\ntold me to come check this place out for him.
I’ll let my big brother know\nthat this is a fun place.
I’ll let my big brother know\nthat this is a scary place.
Ma! Pa! Watch me!\nI’ll do my best!
Ma! Pa! Were you watching?\nI was so strong!
Ma, Pa... I lost...\nGet revenge for me...
All Mom and Dad do is fiddle with their tablets!\nThey never play with me! I’m bored!
I don’t like Mom or Dad or their silly\ntablets! All I need are Pokémon!
Maybe I’m not really their kid...\nMaybe their tablets are...
I may be getting on in years, but I’m a\nself-proclaimed globe-trotting adventurer!
Actually, this trip is just an excuse for me\nto keep running away from reality.
When adventure comes calling for me,\nit’s bye-bye to my harsh reality!
I’m collecting Poké Balls from all over the world.\nAs long as you’re here, let me show you!
What’d you think of my Poké Ball collection?\nPokémon don’t matter to me!
Well, Poké Balls are actually all the same\nanywhere you go in the world, though.
I want to go home already...\nI’ve had enough of traveling...
Trainers keep attacking me...\nI shouldn’t have come to a place like this...
Places you don’t know are scary...\nJust lounging around the house is the best...
What I look forward to when I travel is\ncatching Pokémon at my destination.
When I’m with the Pokémon I brought home from\nmy travels, it brings back lovely memories of my trip.
Lovely memories from my trip\nlive on forever in my Poké Ball.
Thanks to my Pokémon, I spend every day\ntotally addicted to my part-time job.
I have a gluttonous Pokémon that’s\ndestroying my budget. No joke!
Living life for Pokémon...\nAm I OK with this...
After I finish working at my part-time job,\nPokémon battles soak gradually into my tired body.
Yay! Pokémon battles are the best!\nBattles are what I live for!
Terrible bosses, all the annoyances—\nI can forget it all while I’m battling.
All right, I’m going to start the timer,\nso let’s get this over with before it goes off!
Hey, wait! That was crazy fast!\nI guess we can go ahead and stop.
See, see? Time’s already up.\nYou were a bit too tough.
My part-time job is so fun that I don’t\nfeel like going to school anymore.
It feels like I’m going to waste my youth just going\nback and forth between here and my part-time job.
I may not be good at studying,\nbut working is really fun for me.
Your opponent will be me, the\nPokémon Fan Club’s greatest battler!
Soft! You’re too soft! You’ll never get\ninto the Pokémon Fan Club like that!
Oh... You are quite the fan...\nYou are qualified to join the Pokémon Fan Club...
...Shall we begin?\nLet’s see just how much of a fan you are...
Tsk tsk. That wasn’t much of a showing.\nYou’re not enough of a fan yet.
Hmmph... I’m no match for you...\nI can’t beat people who are bigger fans than me.
Do you intend to challenge me,\na director of the Pokémon Fan Club?
It was a mistake to challenge me\nif you’re not that much of a fan.
Glory...to the...\nPokémon...Fan Club...
Well, I’ve got nothing but time on my hands.\nYou don’t look busy. Keep me company!
Well, you helped me kill some time.\nI’m satisfied with that.
Please don’t leave! Things were going so well!\nI have such great plans for us!
It’s not like I’m calling to the mountains.\nIt’s the mountains that are calling to me!
A man who is loved by the mountains...\nGuilty as charged...
I can hear a sobbing voice...\nThe mountains are weeping...
Hi there! I’m a Hiker! ♪\nWatch your step!
Yay! The Hiker won!\nLove and gratitude to my Pokémon! ♪
You made my Pokémon cry!\nI’m gonna break down and howl, too!
How should I hold my arm when I throw a Poké Ball?\nIs it like this? Or maybe like this?
Apparently battles go better when you\nthrow your Poké Ball in the right way.
I looked cool throwing my Poké Ball.\nBut I got distracted, so I lost.
A younger friend of mine\njust became an Ace Trainer...
All right! Can I be one, too?\nAn Ace Trainer...
Everything she knows about Pokémon she learned from\nme. It’s not fair. Why is she an Ace Trainer when I’m not?
Talking...is not...my thing.\nLet’s just battle.
Talking is not my thing, and the\nbattle’s over, so I’m going home.
Talking is not my thing.\nNeither is losing. I’m going home.
My Fairy says to take you out!
My Fairy told me to do it!\nIt’s all my Fairy’s fault!
My Fairy says that you’re crazy dangerous!
If there are still dreams in your heart,\nthen I am still a Fairy Tale Girl.
I’ve decided to ignore reality.\nI’m a Fairy Tale Girl, after all.
Quit talking about my age.
Hey! Who you starin’ at!\nYou want to scrap? Keep it up and you’ll have one.
Whoa... I’m totally on edge...\nIf that had gone on any longer, I would’ve cried!
Waahhh! You’re scary!\nStop picking on me!
I know your face. You think\nyou can battle like that?
Does your face still look like that?\nYou won’t be doing any winning like that.
No! I’m steaming mad! How could I lose\nto someone with a face like that?!
In accordance with the rules of unsportsmanship,\nmy pledge is to play dirty and battle unfairly!
I battled my way through unfairly and dirtily!\nThank you all so very much!
I’m disappointed! I’m disappointed in myself!\nI tried to play as dirty as I could!
I chose the path of the Punk Girl.\nNot being popular is getting to me, though...
Maybe it’s bad that I never give\nhalfway strong guys a chance...
Fine... Maybe I’ll change my tune from\nPunk Girl to surfer girl. Now, look out!
I’ve never done anything wrong in my whole life.\nWhy do you judge me based on my looks?
This outfit is a hand-me-down from my\nmother that she wore when she was young.
You’re awful... Everyone is awful...\nWhy won’t people judge me by what’s inside?
Hmmph... What’s so great about Trainers?\nYou don’t battle yourself, but you sure do talk big.
Next time, I wanna battle person versus person,\nYou’re just a kid, though, so I’ll let you off the hook.
I came here to crush impudent Trainers.
You want to battle with mois?\nYou’re gonna be rust in my frying pan!
Did you think you could defeat mois?\nYou’re softer than a bag of marshmallows!
How could it have turned out like this?\nWhere did my seasoning go wrong?!
As a result of throwing Poké Balls,\nwe are well trained in how to handle pans.
The only thoughts in my brain\nare culinary thoughts.
I’ve been inspired by our battle!\nI’ve suddenly thought of a new dish!
“Zere eez no accounting for taste.”\nZis saying—do you know eet?
Ze bitterness and ze sourness, zey are also\nze important parts of ze flavor, no?
You understand zese words\nI say to you in ze battle, no?
I just got into a fight with my boss.\nHe made me mad, so now I’m slackin’ off!
Oh, this is so irritating!\nWhy don’t you understand me?
I’m doing this for my boss’s sake.\nWhat do you think I am?
I’m tired of serving my boss.\nYou there! Serve me now!
All right! From now on I’m your boss.
Serving people is tough.\nYou can’t choose your boss, so it’s stressful.
Despite my appearance, I was\nan Ace Trainer until recently.
Past a certain age, it’s time to hang up\non being an Ace Trainer and move on.
Ace Trainers past a certain age\nhave all changed their careers.
Oof... My body is weary from doing so much\nhousework, so I’m looking forward to this.
You can’t lose yet!\nYou have to entertain me more!
Unnh... Not yet...\nI can still keep going...
Being a Maid is just a part-time gig.\nI’m really a Battle Girl!
Oh no... I’m glad I won the battle,\nbut I tore my uniform!
The pay from my part-time job is good,\nso that’s why I’m able to battle like this.
This isn’t some kind of cosplay!\nThis is just my style.
Just wearing the fashions\nthat I like gets me excited!
Whoa, that was a close one.\nI almost got my clothes dirty.
I say it’s art, but really I just\nwant to make easy money.
I can have lazy battles like this,\nbut I can’t hold down a square job.
My way of doing things is to put\nridiculous prices on my shoddy paintings.
Aha, your confidence shows.\nYou must have good Pokémon.
Your overconfidence is your weakness.\nWasn’t that an unexpected result for you?
I get it.\nYou have nothing but good Pokémon.
My 88 years of living have led me to this conclusion:\nVictory shall be my only art!
And so I have produced another great work!
Give me back those 88 years!\nGive me back my art!
I come here when I’m low in inspiration,\nhoping to find ideas for new creations.
Your disappointed face pleases me.\nIt stirs my creative impulses...
Your triumphant face pleases me.\nIt stirs my creative impulses...
Before we waste our time on idle\nchat, please show me your skills.
Umm-hmmm... Thanks.\nIf that’s all you got, then never mind.
What excellent Pokémon you have!\nPlease become my model!
I like how you look.\nI could paint your portrait.
Oh! What a great expression you’re showing!\nBeing crushed by defeat makes you more worth painting!
That battle itself was art, but can’t you\nmake more out of your winning pose?
Well, I’m going to do things my way,\nso feel free to battle however you like.
In the end, you have to go at your own pace.\nYou can’t help but be influenced by others.
There’s something nice and comfortable about\nthe pace you and your Pokémon keep to.
I’m what you call a professional punching bag.\nI work here to earn a living.
I tried to lose on purpose to make you feel good...\nThis is no good. I’m definitely getting fired for this...
I’m a professional punching bag, so all that\nmatters is that you’re pleased with your victory.
I’m happy that I’m able to work here.\nThis is truly the job that I was born to do.
Oh no... I won...\nThey’re gonna cut my pay...
My job is to let people win.\nIt’s all right. No problems here.
You’re acting pretty brave for a half-pint!\nYou may have bitten off more than you can chew!
That wasn’t a bad attempt,\nbut I warned you I’d be tough!
Guess I’ve started to soften up. Hey, can’t\nexpect to stay on top of my game forever.
My parents said they’re too dangerous,\nso I made my own Roller Skates.
They’re really popular now, so everyone will shun\nme if I don’t at least look like I’m wearing Roller Skates.
They’re just for show, so the wheels don’t turn.\nI run really fast to make it seem like I’m rolling.
Honestly, these are inconvenient and hard to walk in.\nRoller Skates are not suited for getting around.
Always slipping around is annoying!\nI’m ready to graduate from Roller Skates!
There are only so many places you can skate, anyway.\nHonestly, they’re not useful for getting around.
I’m being marketed as an idol who can sing,\ndance, and skate, but it’s just no good.
When I stop and think about it, being dressed like this\nall the time makes me more of a comedian than an idol.
I can sing, dance, and skate. Now I’ll\ntry to become an idol who can battle, too.
My strategy is to deceive\nmy opponents with my speed.
Ahaha...\nHow was it? I bet that made you dizzy.
How could you be quicker than me?\nWhat are you wearing?
I just finished my introductory training.\nPlease battle me!
The content of my training was good.\nI have to thank my teacher for this!
I made notes of all the things I need to watch out for.\nI’ll take preventive measures before my next battle!
My Pokémon and I are fully prepared!\nBring it on, Trainer!
Yes! Battling when in one’s best condition\nis one of the basics of being a Trainer!
I was so well prepared, though...\nCould it be that my skills are lacking?
Wow...wow...\nAm I wrong, or are you the Champion?
I just beat the Champion even though\nI don’t even have one Gym Badge...
Haha! I expected no less from the Champion!\nI am deeply grateful to have been your opponent!
I may still be wet behind the ears,\nbut I aim to be a Veteran someday!
Soon I’ll be strong and respected enough\nthat everyone will kneel before me!
I think this result is an\ninvestment in my future.
I intend to continue calling myself\na Beauty for as long as I can.
After a battle, you have to care for your skin\nwithin seconds! You have to be careful, too!
To be called a Beauty forever...\nThat is my mission in life...
My friends and I are part of an event\nwhere we try to escape from here!
Huh? Did I win?\nThen we can’t escape!
All right!\nNow I can make my escape!
I’m a Gardener, but I’m\ngood at Pokémon battles, too.
I’m a Gardener, but maybe\nI’ll try to become the Champion.
I’m a Gardener, so my\nreal job is gardening.
The weather’s too awful for me to work!\nI’m just amusing myself here.
Whoa! I’m in a Sunny Day kind of mood!!
If only my Ability were Rain Dish...
The secret ingredient in my\ncooking will be your tears!
Ahaha! Cry! That’s it, cry for me!\nWith that, this dish is complete!
Uhhn... It’s getting cold...\nI was almost finished cooking...
Hey there, Trainer!\nDo you think I’m a grown-up?
Tee hee...\nI won because I’m a grown-up!
Tee hee! My mom did my makeup!\nI’m actually only seven years old!
Grip and rip, baby! I’m going to keep\nshooting even if I use up all my film!
Grip and rip, baby! I’m going to keep\nshooting even if I’m using up all my film!
I really feel like I’m traveling every\ntime the shutter snaps!
I was a fool to think that I would find\nsweet romance at my destination.
All the other people on this tour are old.\nThere’s no way I’ll find anyone.
There’s no romance or anything else for me\nin a country where I don’t speak the language.
They say that battling local Trainers is\npart of what makes traveling memorable.
I made some wonderful memories.\nThank you very much, local [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.
I didn’t need to make any memories\nlike this, local [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.
I put up with a long, long, long, long,\nlong, long, long flight to get here...
I’m sleepy... So sleepy...
I’m sleepy all the time because of jet lag.\nI don’t have the energy for sightseeing...
My husband has no idea, but a long\ntime ago, I used to be a Punk Girl!
My ex-boyfriend gave me all my Pokémon.\nI’d feel bad if I let them go after all this time.
I like my husband for not prying into my past,\ntrying to find out what I used to be like.
Woo-hoo! I’m looking forward to this!\nI’ve always dreamed of battling here!
Marvelous! Fantastic! This feels like a dream!\nThis is paradise for Trainers!
I don’t want to go home! I want to stay here forever!\nI want to live here for the rest of my life!
The secret to my Pokémon’s strength\nis their specially blended food.
How about that? Strong, huh?\nWhat you eat is important!
How could that happen to my Pokémon...\nWhat are you feeding your Pokémon?
How much time do you\nspend raising each Pokémon?
I give each one two full days of cherishing,\nand then it’s on to the next!
You’ve raised your Pokémon well. Are you a passionate\nTrainer, or do you have a lot of free time on your hands?
When you’re tired of training Pokémon, it’s time\nto battle! That’s the trick to working as a Breeder!
I’m so talented that I can\nwin just to change my mood.
If I lose, that tells you I was just killing time.\nIt doesn’t damage my ego at all.
I’ve become so absorbed in Pokémon battles\nthat I’ve started to worry about myself.
When I win a battle, my mind\ngoes blank. It’s really worrying.
It was fun even though I lost, but it\nworries me that I’m not disappointed at all.
Maintaining one’s composure no matter\nthe situation is what being a Trainer is all about.
Even in victory, it is auspicious to\nremain nonchalant, humble, and subdued.
Even in defeat, my heart operates normally\nwithout rotting or becoming sad.
My treasured Pokémon and I have been together\nfor a long time. No need to go easy on us.
Hohoho...\nIs this what they call the wisdom of age?
What an inconsiderate act—beating up\non an old man and his Pokémon!
My husband passed before me,\nso I’m finally free to live the life I want!
When I got older I realized\nhow lovely it is to be alone.
Now if only my son would get himself\ntogether, then I’d really be free!
I don’t care for children.\nThey’re noisy and selfish.
I feel so satisfied when I defeat a child!\nIt feels like I’ve regained my own youth!
If you think people will go easy on you because\nyou’re a child, you’re in for a painful lesson.
The only people who can pull off furisode\nare flashy girls and old ladies, right?
You had better think about your age\nwhen picking out clothes, right?
Don’t you think old ladies\nlook super cute in furisode?
If you’re wondering why I’m dressed like\nthis, isn’t it obvious it’s for my part-time job?
Our uniforms are furisode, so I get embarrassed\nwhen I have to go outside to pick something up.
I think furisode are cute, but they’re\na bit much for everyday wear.
Hey! It’s me. It’s me!\nThe Owner of the world!
How’s that?\nOwned, sucka!
Pffft! I wasn’t seriously trying or anything!\nNext time I’ll show you some real ownage!
My Pokémon are all extremely rare\nones that I acquired on the black market.
See... Look at this glossy coat.\nI’m slobbering in spite of myself.
You and your Pokémon are nice.\nTrade Pokémon with me!
My research was supposed\nto lead the world to peace...
I am a genius. I was supposed\nto take control of the world...
My experiment failed, so I’m\nfinished in the academic world.
In my pursuit of success,\nI became lonely beyond all imagining...
The loneliness of genius...\nThere’s no way you could possibly comprehend it.
Those with overwhelming abilities\ncan welcome loneliness at times.
I want to experiment! Experiment, I say! My hands\nare shaking because I want to experiment so badly!
Beakers... Petri dishes...\nPipettes... Electron microscope...
Huh huh huh...\nSomebody let me experiment...
If you follow a fixed set of rules,\nyou can get a definite result.
This result was inevitable.\nVictory is simply derived.
Th-this isn’t beyond the anticipated results!\nThis is still a predictable result!
You don’t want to hear about Pokémon from\npeople who know nothing about Pokémon, do you?
You haven’t studied enough, but you have potential.\nI could train you, if you’d like...
Just because you know a lot about battles, it\ndoesn’t mean that you know anything about Pokémon!
I’ve researched on top of research...\nAt last I have derived the answer...
It’s that I am a very strong Trainer!
It’s that I am a very weak Trainer...
Look into my eyes. That’s it.\nBreathe deeply as I count one, two, three...
Now you’re under my spell.\nYou’re like a puppet under my command.
My hypnotic powers don’t work on you?!\nWhat mental fortitude you must possess!
I let it slip that I’m a greenhorn\nright before the battle.
You’re not well enough prepared yet.
Because I’m a greenhorn,\nI’m not worth mentioning.
I shall make a prophecy... This battle...\nYou will emerge victorious...
You... Are you so weak as\nto reverse my prophecy?
I’m disappointed, but it can’t be helped...\nMy prophecies are absolute...
I grow stronger with each tear I cry.
Don’t get hung up on sadness or frustration.\nYou can use your grudges to motivate yourself.
Now I can get even stronger.\nI grow with every grudge.
Heh... Welcome back...\nI haven’t forgotten your face...
You! Why did you lose?\nAgain? You’re trying to fool me again, aren’t you?!
Eh...radio waves...\nThere are radio waves coming from your nose...
Kind people are really scary...\nWhy do they have to come so close to me?
Kind people are scary...\nTheir smiling faces and boisterousness are scary...
I just want to be left alone.\nDealing with people is such a bother...
Oh, I see. Would you like to be cut to pieces?\nOr do you prefer the role of punching bag?
You didn’t decide quickly enough, so you got\na little from column A and a little from column B.
Hmmm... If I was going to lose anyway,\nI was hoping to get totally messed up in the process.
The sweat that drips before a battle...\nDon’t you love how cool it is?
Being tired from battle with disheveled clothing...\nIt’s cool! Isn’t it actually the coolest?
At the end of a battle, out of breath...\nHow cool is it? Totally!
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
The adrenaline is pumping in my team! Me, too!\nI’ll make this an awesome battle!
How about it? We’re awesome, right?\nYou were able to explode, weren’t you?
I did what I came to do, and this is how it\nturned out. There’s nothing else to say.
“Go easy on me” is not in my vocabulary.
To me, etiquette is mercilessly defeating\nmy opponents in battle—even the weak.
Even if I give it my all,\nit’s meaningless when I lose.
Let’s have a fun battle! No hard feelings,\nno matter if we win or lose! ♪
Don’t look so down! ♪\nI just happened to get lucky! ♪
Heh...
Pokémon battle is not a sport or a hobby.\nGet out of here if all you want is to play!
Reflect long and hard on\nwhat “serious” means.
You didn’t take it easy on me at all...\nThat was good. You’re a risk taker.
When I’m living without nature in my life, sometimes\nI’ll suddenly feel an anxiety attack coming on.
I’m sure how you feel is not so bad if\nyou compare it to my anxiety attacks...
Something like this is pretty trivial compared\nto the stifling feelings of city life.
Despite my appearance, I was born a\ncountry boy. So I yearned for city life.
You don’t go visit your hometown, do you?\nCity life must be nice.
I was born and raised in the country, so the\nneon lights of the city may be too bright for me.
I’m a nature person, so I was born to be a Ranger!
Being surrounded by nature seems good\nfor your health and your looks, doesn’t it?
I’m a marvel of nature!
I’m prepared to protect nature\nby any means necessary!
Everything has its origin in nature!\nEveryone should revere it!
Are you listening? Remember this...\nNever underestimate the power of nature...
You look kind of feeble.\nHow about I put you through the wringer?
Ahaha! Not yet!\nI’m not done yet!
You did it!\nNext time, you’ll put me through the wringer, huh?
Your Pokémon...\nShow them to me...
All within my expectations...\nNothing to be surprised about...
Yes... You have good Pokémon...\nPokémon must be happy to be raised by you...
To challenge me you must be a reckless,\nfearless person who doesn’t know h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser place!
Hmmph... To challenge me must mean\nthat even ignorance has its limit!
You’re a smart Trainer, considering\nyou don’t know very much.
Even if people call you an Ace Trainer,\nit’s not like you get anything special for it.
I’m just good at battling. I don’t even have a job.\nI’m just another unemployed guy.
In the end, being good at battling alone\nisn’t enough, no matter how strong you are.
Because I’m an Ace Trainer,\npeople think I’m a strong woman.
I thought I’d grow up to be a frail woman who looked\nlike she’d break if you squeezed her too hard.
You have to be strong inside when there aren’t many\npeople who are stronger than you on the outside...
There’s nothing to do but battle...\nFor us...
This result...\nis not what I’d hoped for...
I wonder if we could have been friends if\nwe had met in a world with no battles...
Are you aware of what it\ntakes to be an Ace Trainer?
Of course I’m strong and don’t lose.\nIt’s important that I win gracefully.
You can’t become an\nAce Trainer battling like that.
Huh? Huh? A battle?\nTime to go all out!
Terrible! You’re extremely unprepared! Come\nback when you’ve learned how to throw a Poké Ball!
Oh! You did pretty well, didn’t you?\nYou’re better than I thought!
Hey now, you’re pretty much in a daze...\nOf course, I am pretty hunky...
I know, I know, you can’t help but be\nfascinated by such a pinnacle of hunkiness.
Even when I lose, I’m still pretty hunky...\nI’m just that photogenic.
All right then, throw your Poké Ball!\nI’ll catch it right away!
Catching Poké Balls before they open\nis a surefire way to win that I devised.
Huh... If only I had been able to\ncatch that Poké Ball that time...
I’m, umm, teaching my daughter, umm, about Pokémon.\nI have to, umm, show her her dad’s, umm, dignity.
Umm, is my daughter watching?\nI did it! Daddy did it!
I, umm, can’t let my daughter, umm, see this.\nShe can’t see her dad, umm, lose.
Before I knew it, I was being treated like a\nsenior citizen. Time goes by too quickly...
It only makes me angry when people compliment\nme by saying I’m a Veteran. Don’t you get it?
It’s too late to tell time to stop.\nI’m glad I enjoyed myself when I was young.
Oh... Trainer...\nIsn’t it time...for a battle?
Oh... Trainer...\nIsn’t it time...for a battle?
Oh... Trainer...\nIsn’t it time...for a battle?
Adults are pretty unfair,\nbut that’s what makes it fun.
If you hurry up and grow up,\nyou can have more fun, too.
Humph... Look at how you look!\nAt your age, you should respect the rules.
Maybe it’s because they respect me,\nbut everyone calls me a Veteran.
Veteran...\nMakes it sound like I’m finished, for some reason.
I’m not grown up enough to be happy\nabout being called a Veteran...
Saying I’m a free spirit sounds good,\nbut really I’m just an unemployed homeless guy!
If I can just live here and play\nall day, I’ll never need to struggle.
Dreaming about being\nfree is the best part...
The clear blue water at the beach! All the bikinis!\nThat’s the kind of place I was hoping to get to!
What makes this place a resort?\nThere’s nothing but serious Trainers here!
This isn’t a resort—it’s like torture!\nThere are battles everywhere you go!
I don’t think you can say you’ve been on a\ntrip unless you’ve interacted with the locals.
This is it...\nI’m fully enjoying this trip.
If you want to make tourists spend\nmoney, provide them with a service.
Shall we go together?\nTo the other side of Pokémon battles...
Not yet. We have not crossed the\nfinish line of Pokémon battles.
You might make it there before me.\nTo the other side of Pokémon Battles...
If my theory is correct, you’ll lose with\nthe Pokémon you’re about to send out.
I knew it...\nMy theory was correct.
I should know that a theory is just a theory.\nIt was of no use in an actual battle...
I’m going to save up my allowance, and\nthen someday I’ll take a trip around the world.
I feel like the world is waiting for me...\nYou know how I feel, right?
Whenever I say the world is calling me, my mom gets\nangry and says, “No, it isn’t! Get to work!”
If you’re willing to battle with me, you\nmust have something pretty good, right?
Did you think I would be satisfied\nwith such tiny Pokémon?
You and your Pokémon are nice!\nYou’re doing great for your age!
I work at a restaurant where people come\non dates a lot, so it’s really stressful.
Oh, I feel refreshed!\nThere’s nothing like a good battle to perk you up!
Customers who don’t even order anything and just\nsit there flirting are really, like, totally the worst.
Time for a battle haiku!\nThis is really good.\r\nMy opponent is a kid.\r\nI will win for sure.
Time for a battle haiku! I knew I would win.\nYes, my Pokémon and I are really this strong.
Time for a battle haiku! I can’t believe it.\nI can still continue on. I can still battle.
If you want to reach the peak as a\nTrainer, you’ll have to climb over me!
Even if you run into me disastrously,\nthere’s no rescue team on its way!
Go! You’ve gotta go!\nGo on and leave me!
It’s merely a Pokémon battle, right?\nWhy so serious?
So what if you lose? It’s not like\nthere’s any money in winning.
It’s not like you really lose anything when you lose.\nAs long as you enjoy it, that’s enough.
I don’t believe in things like good luck charms,\nbut times like these make me want to pray!
My view is that whether or not your prayers\nget answered all depends on your own talents!
Maybe I lose because I’m paying\nmore attention to praying than to battling.
I was born in a graveyard and raised in a cemetery.\nLeave all your curses and grudges to me!
Terrible! You aren’t holding enough grudges!\nIf you want to win, put more into your curses!
Defeating me is amazing!\nYou must be kinda cursed, too!
I get stronger by dwelling on the past.\nThat’s the way I’ve lived my life, after all.
Think positive even when you lose?\nSounds to me like refusing to admit your mistakes.
Call me negative or whatever you like.\nThis is just who I am.
Awful! That was an awful performance!\nI refuse to accept a battle ending like this!
What are you doing?\nYou made that worthless! Totally worthless!
Hey, that’s why I’m saying this.\nHow could I end up like this?
Hey, kid! Are you scared of me?\nIf you’re scared, say you’re scared.
Har har har! You were scared of me!\nMy new look is a big success!
Well, I’m a hooligan.\nIf you ain’t scared of me, I ain’t doin’ it right!
I may be bad, but I got nothin’\nbut love for my Pokémon.
I have to spoil my Pokémon\nto say thanks for winning.
What do you think you’re\ndoing to my adorable Pokémon?
My parents are, like, stupidly obsessed with me,\nso I’ve grown up to be magnificently stupid.
My parents totally spoil me when I win, so\nI get pretty full of myself. I mean, wouldn’t you?
My parents are totally there for me when I lose, so\nwhy bother thinking about what I could’ve done better?
I’ve been thinking about opening up a\ntraditional restaurant around here someday.
It takes money to open your own restaurant.\nThat’s why I do all these little part-time jobs.
Doesn’t a traditional restaurant sound groovy?\nI can almost hear the quiet murmur of voices...
I may be a Chef, but I have\nno interest in my own dishes.
I’ve got no time at all for expensive dishes.\nFood from the corner store is really good.
You lose interest in whatever\nyou do for a living, don’t you?
I am a Butler no more!\nI’m now just another unemployed old geezer!
If I had known it was going to turn out like this,\nI wouldn’t have run away from the mansion!
Where can I find a new boss?\nSomebody please hire me!
Working as a Butler is so fun.\nEven more so if you like gossip!
See this smile? It comes from\nknowing my employers’ secrets.
Being a Butler is fun because you can see\na side of people that they hide from everyone.
My employer is watching our battle! Would\nyou please be so kind as to lose to me?
Thank you so much for losing!\nMy employer is sitting over there smiling!
My employer looks angry...\nI’m in for a reprimand when we get home.
I may be a Maid, but that doesn’t\nmean that I can serve just anybody.
I could never serve you.\nYou’re too weak for me to even consider it.
I could see myself serving you.\nYou’re quite skilled, and therefore acceptable.
To live life without a moment’s pause!\nLet’s enjoy the moment to the full!
You’re always short on time during battle.\nJust like life!
Go forth! Pay no heed to losers!\nGo, go, and live your life!
Grabbing a Poké Ball for a battle you know\nyou can’t win is called being a Trainer.
I am overcome by the reverberations of victory.\nA toast to our companions in their Poké Balls!
With the tears that pour onto my palette,\nI shall paint the self-portrait of a loser.
If you describe it as art, you can fool people into\nspending money on some little brat’s scribbles.
People shouldn’t trust their eyes\nto judge things.
Can you trust your own eyes?\nDo you know what’s important to you?
Just walking around town irritates me. It’s nothing\nbut ugly buildings and low-class billboards.
I think it’s a crime for someone with no\ntaste to make a work for public display.
I want to paint over every bit of\nthe scenery in this ugly town!
Thanks for coming all this way!\nI’m sorry I don’t have much to offer,\r\nbut do make yourself comfortable.
Leaving already?\nI had just made some tea, though.
Sorry I couldn’t be more accommodating.\nHave a safe trip home.
I battled too much, threw too many\nPoké Balls, and blew my shoulder out.
I may have won this time, but I wonder how many\nmore times I’ll be able to throw a Poké Ball...
Doing too much of anything will wreck\nyour body. Everything in moderation, OK?
My old lady done left me...\nI reckon it’s all my fault...
Now there ain’t nobody buggin’ me about\nstuff, so’s I can battle as much as I want!
I got too hooked on Pokémon battles,\nso’s I never did nothin’ around the house.
It’s no fun if you’re not ready to treat it\nlike you’re playing instead of battling.
This is still just playing. Just playing.\nYou have to feel as comfortable as that.
Not throwing a tantrum when you\nlose is part of being a Trainer, right?
I may not get a runner’s high, but I get a\nRoller Skater’s rush, so I’m always all smiles!
Hahaha... It just feels so good...\nI want to keep on skating like this forever...
Battles make you feel good, too.\nMaybe that’s also the work of endorphins.
The problem is knowing whether to put your full\nforce into the starting dash or the last spurt of effort.
Aww... If only you could have saved some\nstrength for the last spurt of effort...
All right! The starting dash decided our battle!
I’m really cheap by nature, so I’m\nnot cut out to be a Roller Skater.
Roller Skates are expensive, and then you\nhave to deal with the maintenance. It’s tough.
If you skate too much, the wheels\nget worn out. It’s such a waste.
I’m gonna dive right into your heart!\nIf you don’t catch me, I won’t forgive you!
You can’t catch me with\na feeble set of muscles like that!
I told you to catch me, didn’t I? You threw me back!\nWhy did you throw me back?!
You had better learn that not everybody\ngets to be the star of the show.
It took a while before\nI learned my place.
Keep your capabilities in mind\nas you go on your way.
Hnnph... You’re just some brat...\nWhat do you think I am?!
You did better than I thought.\nYou’ve got quite a bit of potential.
No way...\nMaybe I was taking you too lightly.
This is battle paradise.\nOnly the strong survive here...
As long as there are Trainers, the\nbanquet will continue for all eternity.
Once you’ve made it this far, victory\nand defeat become meaningless.
My life hasn’t been a bed of roses—\nnot exactly overflowing with opportunities.
Life is just a series of happenings, one\nafter the next. Can you keep up?
Even if you lack hopes or dreams, as long as you survive,\nyou’ll become a Veteran someday.
As long as it tastes good, that’s enough.\nDon’t sweat the details.
In cooking and battling, just go for it\nand don’t sweat the small stuff.
You got the details right in that battle...\nDo you even save time to eat?
I’m in the middle of eating, but would you be so kind as\nto let me have a look at your Pokémon? Slurp, slurp...
Slurp... This is so tasty...\nBring them closer so I can get a good look. Slurp, slurp.
Have you got any more to show me? Slurp, slurp.\nDon’t worry. I won’t splash soup on them! Sluuu-uurp!
I do not accept any Pokémon\nthat I do not like.
The only factor in whether or not\nI like a Pokémon is its strength.
Indeed, you and your Pokémon have\nstrength to spare. I like you.
I’m begging you for a distraction. Show me so much\nstrength that I feel like I must be going crazy.
You can’t erase your bad memories.\nBut what you can do is act crazy to fool everybody.
Ah... Ah...\nThank you... That was what I needed.
I’m sick and tired of being called a Beauty.
When people call me a Beauty, they don’t\nrealize how much pressure that puts on me.
You have to make a lot of sacrifices to be a\nBeauty. I’m done with that effort. Moving on!
Come on, let’s get on with it already!\nI can’t stand it when it’s not popping!
Regrets from the past, worries about the future—\nforget all that! All that matters is the here and now!
I want to get to the point where I can\nfeel good about the way I live my life.
Pardon me, but may I ask to\nuse your facilities?
In this part of the world, do you sic your Pokémon\non someone asking a simple question?
No, really!\nPoint me in the right direction while there’s still time!
What? This isn’t a battle appreciation tour,\nbut a battle participation tour?!
I wouldn’t have come if I had known it was going\nto be this kind of tour! Give me my money back!
I paid all that money to battle?\nWhat weirdo would want to do that?
This was supposed to be a one-night stop. But before\nI knew it, we started staying in one place after the next.
By the time I realized what was happening, I was lounging\non a hotel bed. I know it’s wrong, but I can’t stop.
There’s no way this is good for my bank account.\nI know it’s wrong, but the comfort is irresistible!
My trip isn’t over yet!\nI’ll keep on traveling!
If I defeat my opponent,\nmy tour won’t come to an end...
I don’t want to go home!\nI want to keep traveling!
If you believe you can win, you should be able to.\nIf you think you’ll lose, you probably will.
This might be useful for you to learn.\c\nYour preconceived notions are\nmore powerful than you think.
No matter how mentally prepared you are,\nweak Trainers are weak! Hahaha!
I smell a person of exceptional courage.\nHo! I’m looking forward to this!
Ugh! You’re not what I was hoping for!\nYou and your Pokémon have some growing up to do.
Ha! That was just the power I was hoping for!\nWe’re similar—no, just the same, you and I!
I have a special method that\nI use to nurture my Pokémon.
My nurturing methods are perfect!\nI could beat the Champion with ease, I bet!
Why did it turn out like this?\nDidn’t my Pokémon like the feed I was using?!
As a top Breeder, I’ll be using\nPokémon with a certified pedigree.
The pedigree and upbringing of my Pokémon\nare totally different than some mutt’s!
Unngh. What disappointment...\nI can’t allow myself to lose to mutts.
You can’t win just by pretending to be\na Trainer! Have a look at my true self!
Argh! Arrgh!
Ugh! Ug-ugh!
“Eyes! Aim for the eyes!”\nThose were my big brother’s last words...
My big brother was right...\nWatch over me, bro...
My bad... Bro...\nI should’ve listened to my bro...
In the end, this world is all about money.\nEven these Pokémon...
I used my money to acquire my Pokémon.\nThis is the power of being an adult.
If you understand the meaning of what\nI’m saying, then why are you here?
Ah! Flowers and storms will be overcome! ♪\nAs I travel down the path of a battling woman! ♪
Oh! I’ve got myself a win! ♪\nWalk on, down the path of a battling woman! ♪
Losing, crumbling, weeping! ♪\nThe path of a traveling woman is closing! ♪
Throwing Poké Balls to while away your\ntedious hours can make you stronger.
Now that the battle’s over, I will again\nbe afflicted by the same old tedium.
I don’t care if I win or lose, as long\nas I can escape from this tedium.
For reals? Like, a battle for reals?\nWhoa, crazy! Like, too crazy!
For reals? Did I, like, win for reals?!\nWhoa, crazy! Like, I’m too strong!
Whoa, for reals? Did I, like, lose for reals?!\nWhoa, life. Like, life is woe.

Hi, how are you? I’m Nita!\nOh, how I’ve missed you, Champion!\c\nThe strongest Trainer in all of Hoenn, is it then?\nAt last I can go all out!\r\nSo let’s get cracking on it! Prepare yourself!
Eh, that was a savage battle, Champion!\nSo what do you think of a serious Nita now?\c\nQuite the change?

What... Is this for real?
I’m the one who’s beaten everyone in the nation!
I don’t really know what you want from me,\nbut I just have to battle a bit, right?
There’s, like, no way I could have won against\nsuch a strong opponent. That’s crazy.
Huh? I won? What did I do? What happened?\nI don’t get it. Can you explain?
I’m always serious and ready to go!\nI’m going to give it my all again today!
WHAT?! Are you serious?!\nI stayed up all night thinking of that strategy!
See! Everything went just as I expected it to!\nMy calculations were flawless!

Battles all come down to the luck of a moment!\nYou’re amazing for having that luck on your side!
You’ve got to smile whether you win or lose!\nThat’s what it means to be with Pokémon!
It doesn’t matter who your opponent is. All you\nneed is the appropriate method, and you will win.
Even with the ideal method, I could not win...\nYour team is nothing short of amazing.
In any pursuit in life, you must fix your eyes on\nyour desired outcome and proceed accordingly.
Aha! Even halfhearted moves are enough to\nbefuddle an opponent!
Aha! A truly strong opponent will not be led\nastray by such moves!
Aha! You seem to have confused yourself\nin your effort to befuddle your opponent.
These competitions are like a wild party, right?\nYou never know what will come at you!
Your battling style is not bad!\nYour Pokémon seemed to have fun, too!
I was just having a good time, but I accidentally\nwent and won. Sorry about that!
What I want is the glory of victory!\nI’m going to wrest myself some glory with all my might!
I’m frustrated with all my might!\nI’m not going to forget you!
It was what I wanted with all my might!\nThat’s why I could seize victory for myself!
I only use the coolest moves!\n’Cause I want to win while looking cool!
I guess that just plain winning is cooler than\neven the coolest moves...
Any moves will look cool when we’re the ones\nusing them! Hah!
Every meeting in life is precious; every encounter\nto be cherished. Let’s make our Pokémon happy!
I must use this defeat as fuel for my improvement\nand grow stronger. Let’s meet again!
Win or lose, each battle is a unique experience that\nonly comes once in life. I’m glad we got to battle.

“Secrets to Super Training Success:\nAim for bonus goals while you still can!”\c\nThe white goals that appear in front of\nBalloon Bots disappear after one hit, OK?\c\nBut red goals are special bonus goals you\nearn, and they won’t disappear after one hit!\c\nHit ’em again and again and again—until\nthey disappear after a set amount of time!\c\nYou ready for another regimen?\nGood luck!

It’s\nthe trick to beating a regimen in a flash!\c\nI hope you’re ready to go!\nGood luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success:\nUse barriers to guard yourself in a pinch!”\c\nSometimes you simply cannot dodge an\nopponent’s shots.

Store up all your energy to attack!\nGet your timing right, then let loose on\na goal with a great Energy Shot!

Time to work on that Sp. Def stat!\nHigher Sp. Def will make it easier for you to\nstore up energy for your Energy Shots!

Watch out! This Balloon Bot will keep firing\nan endless barrage of shots at your Pokémon!\nDo you think you can dodge them all?!
What are those mysterious objects\ncalled “Bitbots” that float around the\nBalloon Bots like that?!
A Balloon Bot that soars up in the sky!\nCalm down and take careful aim if you want\neven a chance to hit this wily target!
A mysterious force seems to be protecting the\nBalloon Bot from any harm...\nWhat is this barrier, and how can you beat it?!
Duck sideways for vertical shots!\nSoar up or down for horizontal ones!\nYou’ve gotta dodge these tricky missiles!
Some shots are headed straight for your\nPokémon—but not all of them!\nCan you tell the difference in time?!
Even the most furious offense follows some\nsort of pattern! Your only chance at victory\nlies in the challenge of finding that pattern!
Can you blast away the Bitbots in your way?\nYou might have to if you want to complete\nthis Super-Training Regimen in time!
If you wanna dodge these high-speed shots,\nyou’ve got to be ready to move the instant the\nBalloon Bot fires ’em! Maybe even before!

Don’t let your guard down just because you\nbeat one Balloon Bot! There’s a nonstop\nbarrage awaiting you in this Circuit Training!

What’s with these crazy, changing goals?!\nMemorize the patterns if you hope to hit\nthe next one in time!
Your chance for victory might just betray you!\nWhen you think you’ve got it in the bag is\nexactly when this Balloon Bot shoots back!
Your crisis will become the chance for victory!\nIf you can just make it past the first hurdle,\nyou’ll have a chance to turn this one around!
If you keep a close eye on this Balloon Bot’s\nshots, a flawless victory isn’t out of reach!\nDodge every last shot that comes at you!
Revenge is best served cold, you know!\nThis Balloon Bot is back from the tutorial\nand ready to take back all those points!
Try to accurately hit these constantly moving\ngoals while dodging a merciless barrage of\nshots! Do you think you can do it?!
One wrong step will set you back to zero!\nYou’ll have to avoid every last one of this\nBalloon Bot’s nullifying shots to win!
Secret Super-Training Regimens are the\nlast hurdle for your Pokémon to overcome!\nThe ultimate training for the ultimate Pokémon!
Watch for it! When this Balloon Bot turns its\nback, the shots will fly! Be ready for a barrage\nif you hope to pull through this one!
This Balloon Bot’s arms will slow down right\nafter letting loose a shot—that’s your chance!\nUse the opening to launch your bid for points!
The easiest way to dodge these cross-shaped\nshots is to dodge diagonally! But don’t forget\nthat you can also use a barrier in a pinch!
Can you dodge ’em all?! Watch out for big\nshots, homing shots, and the shots from all\nthose pesky Bitbots—all at once!
Who knew that S.T. could pay so well?!\nThe rewards for this regimen are items that\ncan be sold at a high price to shops!
Take on Balloon Bot after Balloon Bot—and\neach one requires a completely different\nstrategy! Give this one everything you’ve got!

[VAR BE05(0001)][VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s sneaky steps[WAIT 5]\nwere beautiful and light![WAIT 5]\nI think it only took [VAR NUM2(0004)] second[VAR NUMBRNCH(0004,0100)]s[WAIT 5]\nto reach that Pokémon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] is quite the[WAIT 5]\ncautious one.[WAIT 30]\n[VAR GENDBR(0000,0201)]HShe’s taking h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]iser time[WAIT 5]\nto approach slowly.

[VAR BE05(0001)]Then a Lv.

Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Welcome to the world of POKéMON!
My name is BIRCH.
But everyone calls me the POKéMON\nPROFESSOR.
And this...is what we call a “POKéMON.”
This world is widely inhabited by creatures\nknown as Pokémon.
We humans live alongside Pokémon, at times\nplaying together as friends, and at times helping\r\none another out.
And sometimes, we just like to have fun battling\nothers like us!
But as close as we are, we don’t know\neverything about Pokémon.
In fact, there are still many, many mysteries\nsurrounding Pokémon.
I do research to try to unravel those Pokémon\nmysteries. But that’s enough about me!
What about you?
Are you a boy?\nOr are you a girl?
Will you give me your name, too?
So you’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
So you’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Ah... I see!
You’re THAT [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou’re the one who’s moving to Littleroot Town,\nwhere I live!
You’re THAT [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou’re the one who’s moving to Littleroot Town,\nwhere I live!
Are you ready?
Your very own adventure is now about\nto unfold!
Be courageous and leap into the world of Pokémon\nwhere dreams, adventures, and friendships await!
I expect we’ll be meeting again soon.\nCome see me in my Pokémon Lab!

Oh! But you can’t participate this turn!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] tried to show its appeal with\n[VAR MOVE(0001)]!
The other Pokémon used their moves.
All [VAR PKNICK(0000)] can do is watch the others.

But its appeal was jammed!
It was swept along by the other Pokémon’s move.
But it failed!
It worked even better than usual!
The audience, who had been looking forward to seeing\nan appeal combo, had their attention drawn away!
It utilized its previous failures to do its best this time!
It can’t use any more moves now!
It worked frighteningly well!
It worked as hard as the currently leading Pokémon!
Anticipation is swelling for a combo on the next turn!
It worked rather well!

[~ 50]
All the Pokémon look nearly equally appealing!
[~ 52]
It became very aware of the Pokémon going on after it.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] will be unable to use any moves after this!
It is feeling pretty calm and collected now.
It is completely oblivious to the other Pokémon’s moves.
It tried to startle the other Pokémon!
It tried to dazzle the audience!
The audience looked away from [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] became nervous!
It tried to unnerve the Pokémon waiting for their turns!
It tried to taunt the Pokémon that are feeling pumped up!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] is no longer feeling pumped up.
The standout leader, [VAR PKNICK(0000)],\nreally tried to show off its appeal!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] hadn’t been standing out\nmuch, but really gave its all this time!
It made about as good a showing as\nall of the Pokémon that went before it!
But [VAR PKNICK(0000)] failed to show off its appeal!

It was a huge hit with the audience because it was the\nsame type as the move used by the last Pokémon!
It totally outshone the last Pokémon! What appeal!
It failed to outdo the last Pokémon. How lackluster...
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] got even more pumped up than usual!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] was so pumped up that it showed off\nits appeal to great success!
It moved up in line so that it can go earlier next turn.
It moved back in line so that it can go later next turn.

[~ 104]
But it couldn’t get pumped up...
It didn’t show off its appeal well, because it couldn’t get\npumped up for its move...
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] was unaffected!
The audience was disappointed to see [VAR PKNICK(0000)]\nusing the same move twice in a row.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)]’s [VAR 01A2(0002)] really excited the\naudience!
But [VAR PKNICK(0000)]’s show of [VAR 01A2(0002)] didn’t go\nover very well with this audience.
The audience is completely taken with\n[VAR PKNICK(0000)]’s [VAR 01A2(0002)]!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] won’t be able to move in the next turn!
It attracted the crowd’s attention, and now no one will pay\nany attention to the other Pokémon’s [VAR 01A2(0002)]!
The crowd can’t tear their eyes away from [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
