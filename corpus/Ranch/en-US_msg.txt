Welcome to My Pokémon\nRanch!
My name is Hayley.\nI'm the creator of the\nPokémon Ranch!\nIt's so nice to meet you!
The Pokémon Ranch is a place\nwhere people and Pokémon\nenjoy living together.
You'll soon see what kind of\nplace the Pokémon Ranch is by\nsimply taking a look around!
I'm on my way to the Ranch...\nKeep your eyes on me, okay?
Are you ready?
3...
2...
1...
Here we go!
...Here we are!\nThis is the Pokémon Ranch!
At this Ranch, both people and\nPokémon turn into this form.\nLook! So cute, right?
The Pokémon Ranch is a\nplace where you can keep\nlots of Pokémon.
Not only do you keep the\nPokémon there...
You can watch Pokémon live\nout their daily lives!
I've been thinking about making\nthis Ranch full of Pokémon.
A life surrounded by lots\nof Pokémon has been my\nlong-cherished dream...\n
Ah...\nA Ranch filled with Pokémon...\nIt's fantastic... It's fabulous...\nIt's...it's...fantabulous...
!
Oops! Sorry!\nI was daydreaming again.
These are all the Pokémon\nI have so far.
I want to keep adding more\nPokémon to the Ranch.
And, you!\nMay I ask you a favor?
How does you and me filling\nthis Ranch with Pokémon\nsound to you?
Will you help me?
...What?\nHmm, I didn't quite catch that.\nLet me ask you one more time.
That's great! I knew it!
I'll take you to the Ranch\nright away!
Select the Miis you want to\ntake to the Ranch.\nThe more you take, the more\nlively it gets, so don't be shy!
Now, to let you in on my plan\nabout how we'll fill this Ranch\nwith Pokémon!
Beginning today, I will bring a\nPokémon a day to the Ranch.
I only ask that you take good\ncare of them!
When you visit the Ranch, every\nday you'll find one new\nPokémon added to the Ranch!\n
Let's work together to fill this\nRanch with Pokémon\nlittle by little!
You can bring Pokémon that\nyou caught in Pokémon\nDiamond or Pokémon Pearl.
That's one way to add more\nPokémon to the Ranch!
If you have any Pokémon,\nbe sure to bring them here!
By the way... Do you have\nPokémon Diamond or Pearl?
Wow! That's wonderful!\nYou can bring your own\nPokémon to the Ranch!
That's one way to add more\nPokémon to the Ranch!
Yes, if you have any Pokémon,\nbe sure to bring them here!
I see...\nIf you did, that could be one\nway to add a large number\nof Pokémon to the Ranch.
Oh, well. That's okay.\nI'll bring a Pokémon every day!\nLet's start from there!
You know how Pokémon are\nadded to the Ranch now, right?
As today's the first and a very\nspecial day, I brought six\nPokémon to add to the Ranch!
Let's start our Ranch with these\nsix Pokémon!
Beginning tomorrow,\n%ls,\nI will bring one Pokémon a day.\nIsn't that so exciting!?
If you are interested in more\ndetails, press the "?" button\nlocated at the lower left of\nthe screen.
The Ranch will become more\nlively as you get more and\nmore Pokémon.
Enjoy watching Pokémon at the\nRanch!
Let's have a great time!
Ah, are you leaving?\nWell, thanks for your help!
May I ask you a question before\nyou go?
Tomorrow is %ls.\nI've been wondering what kind\nof Pokémon I should bring to\nthe Ranch...
Will %ls\nPokémon be okay tomorrow?

For some time after its birth, it\ngrows by gaining nourishment from\nthe seed on its back.
When the bud on its back starts\nswelling, a sweet aroma wafts to\nindicate the flower's coming bloom.
After a rainy day, the flower on\nits back smells stronger. The\nscent attracts other Pokémon.
The fire on the tip of its tail is a\nmeasure of its life. If healthy,\nits tail burns intensely.
In the rocky mountains where\nCHARMELEON live, their fiery\ntails shine at night like stars.
It is said that CHARIZARD's fire\nburns hotter if it has\nexperienced harsh battles.
It shelters itself in its shell,\nthen strikes back with spouts of\nwater at every opportunity.
It is said to live 10,000 years.\nIts furry tail is popular as a\nsymbol of longevity.
The jets of water it spouts from\nthe rocket cannons on its shell\ncan punch through thick steel.
It releases a stench from its red\nantenna to repel enemies. It\ngrows by molting repeatedly.
A steel-hard shell protects its\ntender body. It quietly endures\nhardships while awaiting evolution.
It loves the honey of flowers and\ncan locate flower patches that\nhave even tiny amounts of pollen.
It eats its weight in leaves every\nday. It fends off attackers with\nthe needle on its head.
While awaiting evolution, it\nhides from predators under\nleaves and in nooks of branches.
Its best attack involves flying\naround at high speed, striking with\npoison needles, then flying off.
It is docile and prefers to avoid\nconflict. If disturbed, however,\nit can ferociously strike back.
It flies over its wide territory in\nsearch of prey, downing it\nwith its highly developed claws.
By flapping its wings with all its\nmight, PIDGEOT can make a gust of\nwind capable of bending tall trees.
Cautious in the extreme, its\nhardy vitality lets it live in\nany kind of environment.
It whittles its constantly growing\nfangs by gnawing on hard things.\nIt can chew apart cinder walls.
It flaps its small wings busily to\nfly. Using its beak, it searches\nin grass for prey.
It has the stamina to fly all\nday on its broad wings. It\nfights by using its sharp beak.
It sneaks through grass without\nmaking a sound and strikes\nunsuspecting prey from behind.
The pattern on its belly is for\nintimidation. It constricts foes\nwhile they are frozen in fear.
It lives in forests with others.\nIt stores electricity in the\npouches on its cheeks.
It turns aggressive if it has too\nmuch electricity in its body. It\ndischarges power through its tail.
To protect itself from attackers,\nit curls up into a ball. It lives in\narid regions with minimal rainfall.
It curls up, then rolls into foes\nwith its back. Its sharp spines\ninflict severe damage.
